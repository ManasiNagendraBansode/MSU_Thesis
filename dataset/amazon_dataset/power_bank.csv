5.0,,"May 7, 2017",Yes,"If you're looking for peace of mind every time you leave the house, this power bank doesn't disappoint. It's the size of a credit card and only a hair heavier than my iPhone 6 making it extremely portable without being bulky and heavy. There's a power button you press which shows how much power is left via 4 blue leds (when it's dead, only one led will flash). You can only charge one device with this power bank but I'm always impressed by how quickly this charges my iPhone 6 (from 10% to near full takes approximately 1 hour). So far, I've been able to charge my phone about 4 times from near empty to full before having to charge the power bank. It comes with a usb cable to charge the power bank itself as well as a drawstring pouch. Since I hate carrying around the long original lightning cable from Apple, I bought the 1 foot ""Double Braided Nylon Anker PowerLine+ Lightning Cable"" which is the perfect size...What I love the most about this power bank is how effective it's been. The power bank itself requires at least 2 hours to charge from empty to full but once charged, your phone will charge to full in less time. As a result, I haven't charged my phone using a wall outlet since I bought this power bank more than a week ago. Not having to worry about my phone going dead or being near a wall outlet is the best feeling next to purchasing a new phone...So if you want a reliable power bank that charges your phone in no time and frees you from being attached to a wall outlet, GET THIS!",832
1.0,,"January 8, 2018",Yes,"This portable charger worked as described for two months and then it stopped working completely. I never over charged it and I used it sparingly. Now, it will not charge-up, turn on or charge any device. It has totally failed. I purchased two others in May and they also failed after a few months. This product appears to have a design flaw and lack quality control because the life expectancy is less than advertised. I rate it 1/2 star.",324
1.0,,"May 18, 2017",Yes,"I'm pretty disappointed with the charger. I've had it for less than a month and used it probably a total of 5 times. It no longer holds a full charge. I charged it overnight thinking I needed to charg it for a longer period of time, but that didn't work either.",200
1.0,,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"The battery pack would not fully charge. I tried using it and it only gave my phone 1.5 charges, it should have been over 4 charges. I tried to charge it again and it would only charge a quarter of the way after 24 hrs. I got a lemon and returned it.",126
3.0,,"June 11, 2018",Yes,"I bought the Anker PowerCore 10000, One of the Smallest and Lightest 10000mAh External Batteries, Ultra-Compact, High-speed Charging Technology Power Bank for iPhone, Samsung Galaxy and More because I couldn't find the older model I purchased a few years ago.  I bought the Anker brand because I'd been so pleased with the first one.  They work great with any battery powered electronic product that charges via USB - phones, tablets, WiFi speakers, etc.  This model has only one output, but, according to the specs, can charge a smart phone two to three times before going flat.  I really doubt I'll ever run it flat because my usage isn't very demanding...So, why only  three stars if this charger has so many great points?  I found my first one (DOH!) so ran some head to head tests.  This newer model takes twice as long to charge as the older one.  Its output is limited and takes twice as long to charge up a phone or tablet compared to the older model, and the older model has two outputs to charge two products simultaneously.  This is a good product, but not as good as others.",76
5.0,,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"I've had this power cell for almost 1 year. I left it on my car for a few months in variant weather and never charged it or used it. This morning I plugged it in for maybe 45 min and it was 1/2 charged. My phone went down to 3% and I got terribly lost in an unfamiliar place and needed to use Google maps and I knew that would kill my phone. I plugged in my phone to the charger and walked for 20+ minutes using my phone ,and got to where I'm going. Then left my phone to charge more and it charged all the way to 80% before running out of juice. I am very impressed that even sitting without use and in a hot car, this thing still worked great. I feel like it was definitely worth the money and am so glad I bought it.",117
1.0,,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"I ordered and received this item on January 4th 2018, it’s been less than 3 weeks and the charger is already not holding the charge. It worked fine the first time to had to recharge it, but now it doesn’t even charge.",120
1.0,,"April 24, 2017",Yes,Terrible. Charger doesn't even charge my phone. Even with all apps closed it drains battery. I tried turning my phone off and charging it and it estimated 5 hours to fully charge it. My phone was at 80%. Don't waste your money.,72
1.0,,"October 24, 2017",Yes,Worked great for a couple of months... now it has one bar after a full night of charging.  Disappointed.,46
4.0,,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"Updated: After I posted the review below, Anker customer service asked me to contact them. They looked up my past returns and invited/offered me to give Anker another try. The new charger they sent me has been working perfectly. I can really see why people like the Anker brand so much. I was unlucky before, but now that I have more experience with them, I will definitely have more confidence to buy more products from them. They have excellent value and I'll know that just in case I do get unlucky again, they'll make it right...I know Anker is a well-loved brand but I seem to have exceptionally bad luck with them. This is the second battery I bought and it would not charge. I returned it. (The battery I bought a few years ago also did not work)...I'm sticking with RAVpower for my accessory needs, as it seems much more reliable at least for me.",46
5.0,,"June 8, 2017",Yes,So far so good. I've used it a couple of times and I've been able to charge my iPhone 6S at least 3 times with one charge. I really like the light that tell you how much power is still left. It's also pretty small so it doesn't take up a lot of space.,35
1.0,,"February 3, 2018",Yes,This was a gift I purchased for my son. He is 14 and always using his phone.  The charger stopped working. It will not charge. It worked great at first he really loved it.  I question the quality of the product and will never purchsse from this company again. What a waste.,36
1.0,,"December 1, 2017",Yes,This charger was great initially. I loved how rapidly it charged my phone &amp; I would mention how much I liked the product to family &amp; friends. About four weeks ago I noticed it wasn't charging properly; it was taking to long &amp; sometimes it didn't charge at all. Well now it doesn't charge my phone at all &amp; it won't recharge itself. I am truly disappointed.,64
1.0,,"June 27, 2018",Yes,"This portable charger is amazing, when I had it I almost exclusively used it instead of wall ports because it charge my phone faster. I brought this charger with me when backpacking through Europe and often times when I didn't have an outlet it saved the day. It's also very durable and very portable. So why the one star review, well it was working really well but it seems there was a malfunction of sorts because it was overheating in my pocket, so airport security took it away from me as they deemed it a security risk. I only bought it a month ago and I used it appropriately, so I think I may just have gotten a slightly defective product and it chose to act up at the wrong time and now I am left chargerless.",16
3.0,,"August 29, 2018",Yes,"I really like this power bank because it's small  I can carry it anywhere I go and the pouch that came with it just added more convenience. With this power bank I get 3-4 full charge cycles for my galaxy S9 Plus. I only gave it 4 stars because it does not come with USB Type C cable in order to charge my phone, however it came with it's own cable so I can charge my power bank. Also, this power bank takes a while to fully charge, however when it comes to charging my phone, it's super fast!..UPDATE:.I received it about less than a week ago and I loved it, I fully charged before using it and I was amazed how much power it has! For two consecutive days, it worked wonderfully, I get 3-4 full charge cycles for my device before the anker product needs charging again. However, these past couple of days I noticed my anker power bank isn't lasting long.. I'd only get 1-2 charge cycles for my device before it needs charging. And today, my fully charged anker product drained to 0% while charging my device with it, it went from 100% charged to 0% in less than 2 hours. I Don't think it should do that, so I thought there must be a problem.. I contacted anker customer service and still waiting for response. Will update again soon.",10
2.0,,"September 10, 2018",Yes,"I bought this Dec 2017 and have mixed experiences with this battery. When it charges, it often gets really hot, so I unplug it and let it cool off for a bit, then plug it back in to charge again. Also, when I plug my phone into the battery to charge, it also gets super hot. I don't know if this is normal, but it often gets so hot I unplug it and let it cool down. Another reason why I give this product 2 stars is because about 50% of the time I plug it in to recharge, it doesn't charge all the way full even after several hours, or overnight charging. So I think it's charged up because it's been plugged in overnight, and take it with me on the road, only to find out it is not fully charged. Even though the size is small, it is quite heavy. For these reasons, I would NOT recommend this product. There are too many other charging batteries on the market now that have newer features, that are smaller, lighter, don't overheat, and are guaranteed to charge for a certain number of charges.",10
5.0,,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"EDIT: Anker's customer service has replaced my product as it was still under the 18-month warranty. It completely charges my iPad now and I can still use the leftover charge for my cellphone. I love Anker products and standby their quality, so although I recieved a defective battery once, I will not use it to generalize the company. Their customer service is also extremely patient and helpful...This portable battery was good while it lasted. I have no review about the wire that it came with since I used my own one that is longer. The travel pouch was also a nice touch. I liked that it had some weight to it so it does not feel too flimsy or delicate so I can throw it into my bag without worrying about it breaking. However, I am a bit upset that less than a year after using it, it no longer holds a full charge for my iPad mini.",10
5.0,,"April 23, 2018",Yes,"This is my first Anker power bank and I absolutely love it! I got this as a compact charger I could take with me back and forth to work and to my upcoming music festival I am attending. It is very compact compared to my other power banks. Fits perfectly in my purse and backpack I am taking to the festival..This power bank takes roughly 4 hours to charge completely and charges my samsung s7 approx 2.5 time just as advertised. Another huge plus with this product that I have found is that it really DOESN'T get warm or hot while it itself is charging OR when it is charging your device...Overall I am very pleased with this product, I would defiantly recommend buying this!!",9
5.0,,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"I ordered two of these, one for my wife and one for me, after about a week of reading reviews on Amazon for lots of different makers and sizes..My wife has an iPhone 6S and I have the 6S+. We fully charged our Powercores overnight after they arrivied Monday evening. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings, we both used them to recharge our phones from about 15% to fully charged. My Powercore has just started flashing on one light left at 90% on the phone. That's almost three full charges on a 6S+. I use my phone for reading, FB and games in the evening, my wife tends to text and play solitaire. Her Powercore is still showing 3/4 full. We both have our Powercores charging the phone while using. Pretty impressive...To the people who gave 1or 2 stars because the Powercore comes with a charging cable that doesn't fit your phone --- use the one which came with your phone, you know, the one with a USB at one end and the other end goes in your phone? You should find the USB end fits the Powercore. We just bought two 3 foot lighting cables to keep in the bag that stores the Powercore and it's charging cable. No problem.",8
4.0,,"January 27, 2018",Yes,After a few charges it no longer holds charge..Update: after posting this review I was contacted by the company and was shipped a new one. The new one seems to be holding well. I will change by rating to a 4 star as they stand behind their product and will replace if necessary without a hassle. (And the new one works as advertised),11
1.0,,"January 29, 2018",Yes,Not good. Did not hold charge.,13
5.0,,"March 6, 2017",Yes,"I don't have any other portable charger to compare to but love the size of it - a tad smaller than a deck of cards.  It charges fast.  Faster than any of my wall chargers except my samsung special charger.  Maybe its not possible but you cant charge and be charged at the same time.  It should just pass thru to the target if trying to do both.  Great for long hikes or long flights.  Update 8/2018  Still going strong.  Holds a charge well.  The mini-usb port has never ""felt"" beefy or stong.  It still doesn't but everything still works fine.  I only use it about once a week.  There is a new version available now.",38
5.0,,"May 6, 2018",Yes,"Update 5/11/18:..Anker representative Sharon reached out right after I posted my original review. I was not aware Anker had an 18 month warranty and had already put my old powerbank in the garbage where it belonged because I was so angry (especially since every time i borrowed a friend's powerbank before i finally chucked mine, it was always an Anker brand), but Sharon sent out a brand new one for me and I received it a few days later. I have it now and it is charging, hopefully for a good long life of using when I am low on power. Anker's customer service was wonderful, Sharon was incredibly kind and I am very thankful that I had a bad experience turn into a great one. Thank you!!!!..Original Review:.I have had this product for 6 months and dont even use it regularly. I charge it when I notice the battery has drained over time but havent plugged my phone into it more than a handful of times (less than 10x) as i am pretty diligent about leaving my house fully charged/ saving battery through the day. I noticed the last 2 times I tried using it that the powerbank was dead and doesnt charge back up. When it does, it stays at the last light no matter how long i have it plugged into the wall. What a waste of money and having to carry it around in my purse every day ""in case of emergency"" and in the case of emergency, it doesnt even help. What is the point of this brick.",6
5.0,,"July 22, 2018",Yes,"Once fully charged up this charger holds its charge for a long time in storage.  I've put it away in storage for several weeks up to a couple months and still had a full charge (according to its charge level indicator).  I usually run my phone battery down to about 30%-40% before charging it.  With the charger fully charged, I've fully recharge my phone up to 5 times and still had charge remaining on the charger.  It also charges up my phone very fast!..It came with a mesh pouch and is small, compact enough to carry in my pocket.  It is a little bit heavier than some of the other compact chargers.  But it is to be expected as this charger's capacity and capability are one of the best I've come across...The charger excludes the cord to charge your phone.  So you'll need to have or provide the cord to charge your particular phone.",6
5.0,,"August 16, 2018",Yes,"This thing is heavy compared to your usual lipstick-sized external charger. That’s probably my biggest complaint, but I can get two full charges on my iPhone 6S Plus, so I can't really complain too much. The other thing to note is that it takes more than overnight to fully charge when completely dead. When I was traveling (with heavy phone use), instead of waiting for the battery to fully deplete, I would charge it every night just to ensure that I would have a full battery the next day. On a last note, I was not disappointed with the fact that you have to press the side button to start charging your phone, because I read a review that instructed me to do so prior to purchasing the battery. If I had not known that and simply plugged in my phone without pressing the button, I would have been really upset when I realized my phone hadn’t been charging...Overall, would I recommend this product? Yes.",6
5.0,,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"I bought the PowerCore initially for an international trip and used it multiple times a day for 7 days in a row. What set them apart from the rest was not only the price but the excellent customer service I've experienced previously with Anker...First off, the form factor is much smaller than I originally imagined. This can fit into your pocket! I suggest buying a travel backpack with a USB OUT external adapter. I was able to put my PowerCore into a small pouch on the inside of my backpack and still charge my phone from the outside. A few backpacks have this functionality and it's completely worth it...Whenever my phone got to 50% or so (Samsung Galaxy S8), I would top it off. I was able to do this at least twice a day without even getting the PowerCore to 50% itself. I would just recharge the PowerCore at the hotel or at the airport before I boarded my flights. I used Google Maps almost constantly while walking around the city for directions, so if I didn't have the PowerCore, my phone would be dead halfway through the day...Other uses: On flights while watching videos on my phone so my phone would be at 100% by the time I got off the plane; At night when there weren't close enough power outlets to my bed in my hotels...It really made my travelling much easier. I was able to explore the country and not worry about finding a place to charge, so walking 7.5 miles in a single day did not involve a single stop into a Starbucks to charge my phone...I won't be using it for a while but I look forward to using it on my next trip.",4
1.0,,"June 11, 2018",Yes,My experience with this product is staring at it off and on for over 6 hours now watching to see if it will actually take a charge. I am honestly not sure if I am just really unlucky or what. I can say that the power bank I received did not hold a candle to previous power banks that I owned ((simply because they could manage to hold a charge unlike this one.)) I have contacted customer services to see if they will exchange this power bank for another. If that is successful then I will update this review as to weather the replacement is any better or not.,8
1.0,,"March 3, 2018",Yes,Somehow this unit doesn’t last long in terms.Of charging capacity. Our first unit like this performed well and my kids and I will use it multiple times for 2-3 days without charging it back again. Somehow this red unit doesn’t last a day with 1-2 full charges of a phone?!,8
5.0,,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"Pretty good. Haven't put it too heavily through its paces yet, but it holds a long charge. It's been particularly useful when using extremely battery-heavy apps on my phone..The initial charge took a ton of time, to the point where I suspected that it wasn't charging, but I haven't seen anything like that since..It's fairly compact, but heavier than expected. Works like a charm with my Galaxy S7, was able to charge it from dead to full and still had a ton of juice in the battery left over...I also hooked a Raspberry Pi Zero up to it for a few minutes and didn't have any issue with undervoltage or anything, but I haven't tested that too much. Dunno how well it'd fare with the more powerful Pi models for anyone looking to use it for that, and I didn't test how well it fares with the Pi when running at low battery level.",5
1.0,,"June 5, 2018",Yes,"I've had an anker power bank before and I liked it but it was smaller capacity. Ever since i got this one it takes forever to charge it up like over a day. Charged my phone like any regular charger but it never once ""high speed charged"" my phone. It has 4 little blink lights that let you know when it's fully charged. Once it gets down to 2 forget it, it charges turtle slow. I've been pretty unhappy with it. The other day it took 2 whole days to recharge it, just so it would only work for 1 charge. Looking to get a new one but now seriously thinking the Anker brand.",6
5.0,,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"Update: Anker reached out to me and provided amazing and excellent customer service. We trouble shooted my problem and when the battery couldn’t be fixed, they shipped me a brand new battery at no cost. The new battery works perfectly and I appreciated their immediate call to action!..Prior post: I lived for this charger when I first got it. I definitely couldn’t have made it through my two week trip in Japan without it. It charged very quickly, which was essential, and would fully charge my device at least twice in a day. But now it’s at the point where it takes two or more days to fully charge and won’t even hold a charge for my phone. I would make sure the battery pack was completely drained before recharging so maybe it’s just age (a little over a year) and typically ware that has ruined it.",5
5.0,,"February 12, 2019",Yes,"During my last vacation, I knew I'd be playing tour guide in a city I've never been to and didn't want my phone battery to die before seeing the city sights. The PowerCore was a lifesaver, using it almost daily!..Whenever my phone would hit 20-30%, I would connect it to the PowerCore. The PowerCore is compact enough that it and my phone could be left in my jacket pocket; so, I could still use my phone while it charges..As for how many charges the PowerCore can charge a phone , I would estimate that a light (the ones indicating how charged it is) is equal to 1 charge (2800 mAh), as I was able to go about 5 days without charging...Charging the PowerCore 10000 does take awhile. I experimented a little with different chargers and cables, but it took forever with my phone charger; be sure to use the included cable and have a powerful-ish adapter (I used one with these specs: input: 100-240V-50/60Hz 0.3A, output: 5V --- 2A)...Anker had great customer service (had issues, which were quickly resolved). Please contact them if you have any issues with your product.",2
1.0,,"January 27, 2019",Yes,"Bought this in June. It stopped working in a January. It was adequte while it worked but suddenly it just stopped working! It has a full charge, three solid blue lights and a fourth blue blinking light when it’s plugged in and charging through a receptical. However when I disconnect it and plug a working USB to lightning cable in it, the battery doesn’t want to turn on! So... as expensive as this is, it stopped working after 6 months beyond the amazon return window. I’d say pass on this item!",3
1.0,,"November 30, 2017",Yes,Ordered this product on Aug. 2 received it and it worked great up until yesterday.  Before yesterday noticed the 4 blue dots that lite up weren’t lighting up evenly but didn’t think much of it.  Went to charge it last nite woke up today morning and it won’t even turn on.  Pressed the power button on the side...nothing?  Tried to charge my phone...nothing?  Even tried charging it again but nothing?  It’s just dead.  Not sure if I’m the only one experiencing this problem but just wanted to let you know what issues I’ve ran into with this product.  1 star for working while it lasted.,14
5.0,,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"It is small and can charge my phone a few times. I’ve purchased over 25 batteries in the last year or so for myself and family members and this is the best dollar to overall power and longevity out there. I’ve had quite a few other brands die after a month and this little guy gives me power whether I’m at camp, construction site or road trips. I’m buying more right now as stocking stuffers because they are a great piece of mind item. This product alone has made me try out other Anker products",3
1.0,,"June 18, 2018",Yes,"This worked the way it was supposed to for a week. When it didn’t charge next time I assumed it was because I needed to charge the unit, so I did. It started charging my phone but stopped at 80%. I recharged the whole unit again but it only charged my phone to 40% next time I tried using it (both times when my phone was at 20%) before it stopped charging. Really disappointed because it was so great for my 3 year old iPhone 6 that needs to be charged multiple times a day. Returning this item. Hopefully it was just a faulty unit because there are so many great reviews.",5
3.0,,"March 2, 2019",Yes,"Don't charge your phone with the black cable that comes with this unit, it might break the phone. I used the black cable to charge my Samsung S4, it charged it super fast and my phone got really hot during the charging. I did this few months with no issues what so ever. But one time I was on flight that took 8 hours and I forgot my phone on this portable charger (with the black cable) and it got ""overcharged"". It was fine at first but later it didn't charge at all, the charging port got fried, it cost me only $20 to fix that though...Now my phone works but it's not the same anymore. That overcharging also did some damage to the motherboard which is why my phone is slower and it acts ""weird"". With a Samsung charging cable it's charging normally but I still take it out immediately after it's charged, just in case. I think the black charging cable is only for charging this portable battery, nothing else.",2
1.0,,"February 11, 2019",Yes,"Not impressed. I bought this charger to bring with me on vacation. It appeared to be fully charged as all blue lights were lit up. I got almost one full charge out of it and all blue lights were off, I charged device when we arrived to the resort. This device takes FOREVER to charge, after being on the charger for over night there were only 2 blue lights lit, i took the charger to the beach with us, plugged a speaker into it and it only lasted about 20 minutes before it turned right off. After coming home from our vacation I plugged it into an outlet at home questioning if it could just be the outlets at resort. After 2 full days of having it plugged in, it finally said it was fully charged( all blue lights lit up) and once again used it for my phone while at a wrestling match, charger died with in 3 hours and phone was only charged to 67%. I read lots of review before purchasing I went with this one because it was supposed have a quick charge and it didn’t even seem to have a full charge and was far from quick to fully recharge itself.",3
5.0,,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"Update.... tried another cord and it now works to charge my phone so changed my rating to 5*. Honestly it would have been 4* since the cord failed, but their customer service contacted me immediately and they were going to replace the unit (now they're going to replace the cord). Any company that on top of things gets an extra star from me! Working version back!!!  😀  Initial 2* Review.... At first I loved it. Power for my phone whenever,  wherever I needed it, but.... it stopped working about a month in. Honestly I haven't had the time to figure out if the cord is the problem or if it's the pack itself.",4
5.0,,"July 1, 2017",Yes,"LOVE this portable charger. It comes with a cable that you plug into USB for charging it up, has clear indicator lights telling you how much the battery is charged, and you use your own phone cord for charging your phone via the charger. It also comes with a carrying bag, which is a very nice thing for me. I keep the cords in there so I don't lose them, along with a pair of headphones. :)..It's small enough to fit in my purse easily, but not to small that you'll lose it. I recently brought it to an event because my phone battery was low (whoops) and let it charge in my purse. So much more convenient than trying to find an outlet! I'd absolutely recommend this product to others.",4
1.0,,"March 16, 2018",Yes,"After 3 months of having purchased this it no longer charges!! I press the button to see the battery status shows fully charged however it blinks really quickly as if showing an error. Very dissappointed by this item specially because they are not on the inexpensive side. No droppong, banging, or anything else that could have damaged this item occurred, which is the even more dissappointing part.",6
3.0,,"January 25, 2019",Yes,"I probably uses a total of 12 to 20 times for charging my cell phone in my pocket while at work, at the same time listening to my Bluetooth podcast. I never dropped it, or banged it once, but then I just stopped receiving a charge from it no matter what type of item, or type of cord i plugged into it. I used to be a fan of Anker products, but after receiving two duds of battery chargers, I will be looking at other brands for my next purchase...Update: After calling Anker and spending half an hr on the phone with customer service explaining and running tests, they finally sent me a replacement free. The caveat is that it has to be within the six months of date of purchase, and they will only send you one free one, so if the second one craps out on you, you're out of luck. I updated from one star to three stars because they did send me a new product as a replacement, but 2 piece of crap equal just one large piece of crap....",1
5.0,,"April 4, 2019",Yes,"I received small, marketing-ish power banks previously, and while I found them helpful, I was always disappointed by how much battery life they actually had. When our power went out several times in one week last year, I decided I needed to have a more reliable way to charge electronics (my husband is a type 1 diabetic, so we need to make sure at least one device is working so his continuous glucose monitor can notify him as needed). I was delighted at the compact size of this device, as well as the bag it came in. I keep the bank, along with an iPhone cord, in a sandwich baggy in my purse, and I have used it many, many times. It holds an amazing amount of power; there are 4 lights to inform you of charge, and I swear, I can charge my phone 3 times and it maaaaybe ends up going down to 3 stars! I was actually inspired to give a review tonight because it's charging my iPad while I watch a show. I had the iPad plugged into the wall, and it's charging faster from this little power bank than before! You can't beat the reliability and peace of mind you can get from this portable little device. I'm actually considering buying one for a few friends!",1
1.0,,"July 4, 2018",Yes,"The charger worked for a few weeks and charged my phone just fine. The charger would accept a charge, too. But now the charger will not recharge even after I leave it plugged in overnight. I use the recommended 5v/2a charger that is recommended and still it won’t charge over 25% - only the first light will illuminate after hours and hours of charging. Now I’m outside of the return window with no recourse. Such a piece of junk and I warn any buyers to stay away and find a more reliable brand.",5
5.0,,"October 5, 2018",Yes,"I have had three of these powercore 1000, they are awesome to have laying around the house in case someone exclaims their phone is dead as they head out the door. We bought an Anker Powerline 1ft Lightning Cable to take with it so it's very compact and fits in your coat pocket or backpack to charge as you go...We did run into one of our powercore batteries not being able to charge items.  It appears that it was getting charged but when we pressed the button and connected it to devices that needed charging it would not turn on or charge. It had only been two months since I had purchased it and Amazon's return window had closed. So I contacted Anker. These powercore batteries have an 18 month warranty and they stand behind it. After a couple of quick emails back and forth, I tried a few things to fix it, they asked for a serial number and a replacement charger was in my hands a week after I contacted them. Excellent customer service. They were prompt and even asked if I wanted to wait to receive the same color I had before (red) or if I'd like to substitute another color...So buy these handy battery chargers. They work and they are covered by Anker's awesome service. I'm now buying all Anker products from now on.",1
5.0,,"December 25, 2017",Yes,"Follow up to review below.  After it was posted i was contacted by seller. Turns out the cord was bad. Changed cords and now this battery works perfect again.  I love it. Charges fast and very light weight and small for capacity...I've had this for about a month.it worked great at first - fast charge,high capacity.i used it at work when my phone would die halfway thru the day because I'm always on it.but then about a week ago it quit even being able to keep up with the phone usage,so i get zero charging unless the phone is off. I don't know what changed.and it's not my phone because other battery chargers i have still work.",3
5.0,,"December 31, 2018",Yes,"I’ve had, and still have, multiple Anker chargers, as well as cables and wall plugs that I have had a great experience with which is why I was so disappointed with this product when I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas.  No matter what I tried, I could not get this pack to take a charge at all.  I let it charge overnight and the indicator lights never moved.....one solid light and the second light blinking.  I’m returning it for a refund and am going to order the 13000 mAH version....hopefully with a better outcome...Update:1/7/19.....Anker customer service reached out to me after seeing that I had a problem with the portable charger.  Even though I had returned the defective one and ordered another, larger capacity charger, they wanted to do right by me and send me another 10,000 maH charger.  I have been using Anker products for several years and I swear by them.  Their commitment to customer service is excellent as well!",1
5.0,,"October 18, 2017",Yes,"I got this to charge my iPhone/Camera in the backcountry of the Sierras.  It worked perfectly for a week of backpacking and is a better weight/volume choice than a solar cell set that only works in the daytime...PROS:.Light weight (7 ounces or less than a decent solar charger for backpacking).Small Volume.10 Ah (amp hours).Got at least 5+ full phone charges.Works on my laptop, headphones and any USB device that runs out of batteries.  Keeps you mobile after your primary battery dies...CONS:.None that I can see...BOTTOMLINE:.What I love about this battery is that I can fit in my pocket and I still can have my headphones on or my laptop on the table.  Just a good USB cord, and you have basically enlarged your phone, laptop or headphone batteries.  I got a 7 ounce 10,000 mAh for backpacking.  I'd get the 20,000 mAh for urban use.",2
2.0,,"December 29, 2016",Yes,The product was shipped and arrived according to the timeframe when it was ordered. No problems there. It came with a half charge and I used it to boost the viewing of a movie. The problem is the charging. I've had it plugged in  for 16 hours already and it's only showing half charged. Not sure what to make of that. I've charged other units on the same port that I'm using now with no issues. The product  looks nice it is a great compact design. But so far the charging portion of this product is not working very well.,7
3.0,,"May 23, 2018",Yes,I did a lot of research on portable chargers which lead me to believe that this one was going to be the best.  It was working great the first month and a half then after that it was charging my phone really really slow.  Even if there's no apps/programs running and/or when I shut off my phone it was still charging really slow.  I'm not sure why bc I use its original cord when charging too.  I had higher expectations for this product bc of its Anker brand and now I'm very disappointed in its speed and performance.  I really thought I had the best portable charger when I purchased it.  :(. May 30th update :  however after writing the review above ^^^ Anker customer support contacted me via email and asked me a few questions then replaced it for me.  I just received the replacement one today and have not used it yet.  Hopefully this one will work better than the first.  I appreciate their customer support services very much.,3
4.0,,"September 13, 2016",Yes,"I had heard about the Anker battery packs for quite some time, and seen several positive reviews for them, so when I booked a vacation this summer I made sure to order this battery pack. I definitely was not disappointed...The battery pack itself comes with the battery pack, micro USB cable, and a mesh drawstring pouch. The pouch is large enough hold the battery pack with a lightning and micro USB cable, but small enough that it fits into a pocket and can be easily forgotten about...The charge time for this battery pack is not bad at all, a few hours from being completely dead and it's fully charged and ready to go. I can charge my iPhone while using it about two and a half times with the battery pack, girlfriend can charge and use her Note 6 twice...The only thing that I can fault the battery pack for is its thickness. While the profile of the battery pack is roughly the size of a credit card, the pack itself is as thick as two iPhones. It has been brought to my attention that Anker now makes a slim battery pack that appears to solve this problem, although I have yet to try that one to compare...Overall, this is a great travel charger; small enough to bring out with you on an overnight trip or out with you, but good enough to give you a couple charges and keep you going. Definitely would recommend.",5
1.0,,"October 24, 2017",Yes,2 of the 3 I purchased no longer hold a charge!!! Put them in the trash were they belong ... the one left is still hold its charge we will see for how long,9

We were delighted!..We received the Charger and charged it over night - it displays four blue lights indicating fully charged. During the trip, we used mobile phones as GPS devices for both driving and walking and as an encyclopedia for facts about locations we were visiting. Plugging our phones into the vehicle's USB connection was slow and often not dependable when using our phones as maps, navigation systems and the like...The Anker battery is solid with a substantial feel, a simple neat design and small 'footprint.' It never felt hot while using it and fit nicely into our day packs. It comes with a cord to plug it into a wall charger...Note: Going through [six] baggage screenings, I would put all three of my camera and the Anker batteries in a clear plastic bag so that they could be easily seen and quickly identified as electronics equipment...The Anker charged our phones from 49% to 100% in under an hour while using the phone. We would charge one phone while using the other, then switch and soon we would have two charged phones. I also used it to charge my camera battery...We would get three full mobile phone charges on a single Anker charged battery and still, the Anker battery had one light fully illuminated light. We carried the Anker charger everywhere with us and were not disappointed...This was a great purchase for our trip.",0
3.0,,"April 6, 2018",Yes,I bought the charger based on the reviews along with Amazons choice. Worked for just under 1 year and just stopped working on my recent trip to Spain. I have a no name brand charger with a lower mah and that chargers faster and is just about 4 years old. Will be hesitant to purchase another Anker product. Right in the trash....Update. Immediately after posting my review I was contacted by Anker and was sent a replacement charger. The customer service is perfect and with the content of the emails and messages Anker stands behind their products. Thanks Anker!!,3
4.0,,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"In today’s world, we often need a working phone all day, typically longer than the phone’s regular battery life. With previous purchases, I have had bad luck when it comes to battery packs. After sorting through some details, I decided to purchase the Anker PowerCore 10000. I used it every day throughout my summer traveling abroad and it never let me down. If you’re in need of a trustworthy battery back, I encourage you to read below to see my results and why this is my top choice...Style:.I bought the black Anker PowerCore 10000 battery pack for $29.99, which has been well worth it. The pack also comes in white or red at a slightly higher price of $33.99...The battery pack is very durable, which makes it more functional for busy lifestyles. It has a hard, sleek covering which has protected it through many falls. If it is common for you to accidentally drop your devices, there is no need for you to worry about this one breaking...Function:.I started using my battery pack the day it was delivered. It comes charged and ready for use. Along with the pack comes its charger and a travel case. You can plug in any existing charger you have for any type of cell phone, tablet, or other technology devices to the battery pack as long as it has a USB end...The Anker PowerCore 10000 charges my iPhone 8 three to four times through without being charged itself. If you have an Android phone, it is said to charge it two-and-a-half times fully. If this isn’t enough extension for you, the Anker PowerCore also comes in a 13000 setting and a 20100 setting, which increases the number of times it can fully charge your device...Reliability:.The Anker PowerCore 10000 is the most reliable because it provides multiple charges and keeps its own charge for several days, creating convenience for you. The pack easily fits in my purse where it is conveniently accessible, but when just in hand, the sizing of the pack can seem big. The pack will tightly fit in a women’s jean pocket and comfortably in a man’s jean pocket...You won’t need to worry about the hassle of re-charging your battery pack or waiting long hours for it to complete when you’re in a time crunch. The pack charges from completely empty to fully powered in about five to six hours, which is easily done throughout the night. If it is running low, I’ve found I can do a quick charge while I get ready in the morning and that is enough time for it to last me throughout the day. The pack displays four small lights that indicate its life remaining. This allows for convenient planning on when to recharge...Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Anker PowerCore 10000. I give it a four-star rating. If you are looking for a durable, convenient, and reliable battery pack, ponder choosing the Anker PowerCore 10000.",2
5.0,,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for a 2 week vacation to South Africa seeing as I was out most of the day taking lots of pictures and nowhere to readily plug in my phone. This thing is super small, fits in my small purse and I did not have to recharge it at all the whole time I was gone. Granted I did not use it every day, but the fact that it holds charge that long is amazing. After about 11 days it still had 75% of the charge and I had used it at least 4 times. It does charge pretty fast which is a big plus and because it is so small, I don't even have to take it out of my purse..It comes with a micro USB cord only, so I had to purchase a shorter USB-C for my Samsung GS8.  Great buy.",1
5.0,,"November 9, 2016",Yes,"My husband and I purchased two of these shortly after Pokemon Go came out and we were spending countless hours playing during our evening walks and on the weekends (which we've done for years anyway). But, as we all know, Pokemon sucks the life out of your battery. We looked around at our local Walmart and bought some cheap $6 portable charger which did an okay job at prolonging the battery life for a short time but we needed something that would last a while and at the same time, actually charge the battery, not just slow down the inevitable death of it...IT WORKS!! There have been times where I'd let my battery get done to 18%-20% and then plug it into this charger WHILE playing Pokemon Go and after a while, my battery is back to 100%, again, while having the game on at the same time. It charges up to 4 cells (there are 4 little blue lights, so you'll know how much juice it has) and you'll see each light disappear as the charger itself is draining but no worries, because it can take over a good hour before the first light fades off. THIS THING IS SERIOUS! To keep it charged, we just plug it into our desktop computer and leave them in until we need to use them. So convenient and the best part, the part that really matters, IT WORKS!! :)..I would definitely recommend buying this!",2
4.0,,"August 1, 2017",Yes,"lots of juice, good price, Anker is killing it.  I'm generally a fan of Anker power products and this battery brick is no exception.  it has a great MAH capacity and will charge a phone, go-pro, and any other USB device you can throw at it.  It's now part of my daily laptop bag use.  My only complaints are 1. I wish it had the 2A fast charge, and I was hoping for passthrough charging.  More USB ports would be nice as well.  I've found myself in multiple scenarios where I wish it had more than one charging port. Now, this isn't necessarily Anker's fault, I knew what i was ordering, but as a consumer I just don't ""Love it"" for that reason. it's about the same size as my wallet which is awesome for so much power on the go.",2
5.0,,"April 1, 2019",Yes,"Purchased this as an upgrade to a prior model of the 10000. Had the previous model for about 5 years, it survived many drops (metal outer casing). Battery recently started dying quicker. This new model, doesnt seem to be as sturdy the outer casing feels like plastic. And my older model had 10 lights on the power button signifying battery power in 10% increments which made it much easier to know exactly how much power I have left. This model only had 4 blue lights signifying 25% increments. Works well but I can't help but wonder what will happen after the first jarring fall off a counter onto the floor.",1
5.0,,"September 29, 2016",Yes,"Very good. Charges well, great quality, great customer service. Pretty lightweight to carry around for day to day activity, such as going to work, to school, or whatever you need it for. You don't have to worry about lugging it around. I do have a 20k one that I only carry with me if I go on vacation. Can probably do 2-4 charges depending on phone type and battery level. Since I have an old android phone and tend to charge it before it gets down to 50%, I don't have to worry about charging it until maybe 3-5 days later. I use to have 3k one that I'd have to charge a lot...A kid relative dropped mine and the cable was damaged. I wrote to ask if I can buy the replacement cable since I really liked it and it was my fault that it got damaged. The person who I spoke to in the e-mail actually offered a free one because of the warranty was still in place and sent it to me free of charge. Great product and great communication.",3
5.0,,"February 23, 2019",Yes,"I have used this charger on a daily basis for over two years. After constant charge/discharge cycles I'm still able to charge two phones from about 10-100% before depleting the charger. A common complaint is that Anker does not offer pass-through charging; i.e. the unit cannot charge a device while it is being charged from the wall. Trust me, you don't want pass-through charging. It compounds the deterioration that all batteries go through. The reason Anker doesn't permit this function is to ensure that the unit has a long life. I've done over 700 full cycles on this battery and have no need for a replacement yet. You don't need to spend over $100 on a charger whose battery you will simply punish and run into the ground. That's what the Anker is for, and the prohibition on pass-through charging just ensures that the unit lasts as long as it does. Make sure you have a 5A connection to charge this device, or it will take 9+ hours to charge. Many laptop computers will slow-charge the Anker, a wall is the best bet. If you need your phone charged ASAP, go with this one.",2
5.0,,"July 3, 2018",Yes,"We recently took a trip overseas, and our 2-year-old Galaxy S7 Edges had had some battery issues. One had to be factory reset, and that was just before the Oreo update. That update was hard on my phone, so even with the Global SIM function turned off, wifi alone was causing it to drain quickly. When we found ourselves walking around cities with low battery on the pocket wifi or either of the phones, the PowerCore was more than enough to charge both phones and the pocket wifi to full (a battery monitor showed that the phones were only at about 2500 mA, about 2/3 of their rated 3600 mA). The Anker PowerCore 10000 is not super-fast-charging, but with a capacity of 10,000 mA, I wouldn't expect it to be. The four blue lights give a nice, quick reminder of about how much power is left. And this was light enough to throw in a backpack or even a small purse. The battery is small enough that I could leave it attached to my phone, charging, and still take pictures or check emails. While overseas, I saw back-up batteries with less capacity that cost more. This thing is a gem, and a must-have for travel where you're going to be away from a hotel, plane, or train outlet for long parts of the day.",0

Use constantly all day and night without worry. A must have on vacations as a day out in Vegas will easily drop u to 0 after pics and videos or navigation. Durable, effective, compact. Heads up, the black charger was a tad longer, didn’t even realize it until now. Also, can charge to to 100% quick but its almost a false reading as it drains really fast. I keep one with me in my EDC bag and at work at all times. It’s helped out friends and clients as well. Charges iPhones well but an iPad mini will zap this to nothing so stay away from larger electronics. Buy it, buy 2 of them!",1

Out for a full day and my battery dies on my Android it has charged my phone from 0% charge  to 100% with juice left over. It is a little heavy but not overly so. It is sturdy, an attractive black color , and comes in a nice mesh carrying case with the USB charger. You can easily keep this in your briefcase for emergencies. I lost my initial  Anker a few weeks ago on a trip to France (out for the day and left in on a counter in a  store). I mourned its loss and there was no doubt I would replace it with the same model. I now have my replacement unit and will guard it with my life. I have already used out during a power outage . Again it boosted my phone from 30% to 100% in no time and still had 3 of 4 bars of power left on the Powercore. I recommend this unit wholeheartedly.",1
5.0,,"June 25, 2018",Yes,"Best external battery on the market, hands down!  With an even better warranty!!  What I will say, which no one has mentioned/spoken of, as far as I can tell, is...I purchased the newest model iPad.  And while this model battery bank was charging the iPad, the anker external battery literally got HOT, as if it was being overworked.  Im not a professional, but I came to the conclusion that the newer model iPads are charging at FASTER speeds than the what these model anker batteries can put out (5V 2.4A).  It literally seemed as if the iPad was having the anker battery charge FASTER than it's maximum output.  After that, my anker external battery never worked properly again.  I still have it and use it as a back up, but anker had to send me out a replacement one.  I make sure to never use these on my iPad again, and I wouldn't recommend doing so either, till there is some sort of answers as to if these newer model iPads are forcing (anker) battery packs to go faster and work harder than their maximum output allows them to.  It's pretty much equivalent to a car who's maximum speed is 100 mph, but it's being forced to go 150 mph.  Eventually it'll overheat and/or not work properly, that's what happened when my anker saw the newest model iPad.",0

I will not use this to charge my smartphone. I tried using it to charge my rechargeable bike lights as well. It didn't seem to be doing its job either. As of this writing, I am still thinking of returning it to the seller. Maybe they can advice me on a better power bank. I need one that can fast-charge my phone and prevent charging errors.",2

However, customer service reached out recently and opted to remedy the issue, which has 100% changed my opinion of Anker. Unlike the first, this representative was very kind and truly showed an interest in understanding what transpired and how they could earn my business back. The level of attention I was shown, coupled with the sheer fact that the incident occurred many months ago, made me feel truly valued as a customer, rather than just another email in their inbox...So far the product has worked as well as my friends initially raved about and I could not be happier :). I highly recommend this product and the customer service that Anker provides.",1
5.0,,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"This product is a life saver. I work two jobs, almost 80hrs a week. My phone has a long charge and can usually last past a workshift of 8hrs. I work in a casino and there is not a lot of signal and sometimes my phone battery drains faster than it should looking for cell phone signal. The Anker Powercore 10000 saves me everytime and makes my phone last two entire wokshifts. No more being tied to the wall outlets and guarding my phone from thieves in the breakroom. I keep my phone in my pocket and charge it on the go. I could probably get a good 4 full charges on my phone from this one device. I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Being that my battery lasts a long time as is, I only need 2 full charges in a 24hr period. One full charge overnight initially from a regular charger and one full charge from the Powercore 10000. After I charge my phone with the Powercore one time, I still have at least 3/4 of charge left in the Powercore (3 blue lights still lit of four that tell the user how much charge is left). Best aprt about the Powercore is once it's fully charged, it blocks anymore charge from entering the device. It detects its fully charged and stops the charging process, again distinguished by the lights on the device. Naturally I charge it every night...However, I had a problem with the first Powercore 10000 I purchased originally from Amazon. It was a manufacturer's defect. The port that charges the Powercore got messed up somewhere along the way and just stopped charging the device. It's not the port I use when it is in my pocket. I use the device's USB port when I charge my phone so it was not wear and tear or abuse or neglect. It was indefinitely a manufacturer's defect. I did not contact Amazon. I contacted the company and called in for the warranty. The response was prompt. The solution was easy. And I did not have to wait a very long time before I had a replacement in hand. The replacement took no longer than 2-3 days after Customer Support was contacted and we agreed on  solution. I did not want a refund after this purchase because I loved the product too much. I did not pay for shipping. I did not pay for the replacement. And Customer Support gave me absolutely no issues. Definitely a good buy!",1

He asked me to ""buy him one"" but I had to tell him no or he would be on his tablet 24/7.  This is a great charger and the price is so reasonable.  I recharge it just to keep it fully charged and it is very handy to carry with us.  I keeps an amazing charge for day and it gets a full work out on the weekends with my phone and traveling with 3 kids who can be plugged in on long car trips...I totally recommend this to any one thinking about carrying a portable charger.",1

About a week and a half ago we noticed it no longer accepted a full charge (3 of 4 LEDs).  I got on Amazon to research how long the warranty lasts, and to my delight, it's covered for 18 month.  Since we had our PowerCore for 17 months, I sent Anker an email on October 4.  They immediately responded, and Friday (10/I2) we got our new PowerCore in the mail!  I've read Anker's responses to customers on the Amazon site and can confirm they really back up their product.  If everybody took customer service as seriously as Anker, it would be a much nicer, kinder world.  Way to go, Anker!!!",1
5.0,,"March 3, 2019",Yes,"EDIT: even if the initial product may have failed, Anker seems to be a pretty solid company and sent me a replacement, no questions asked. This replacement works, and is great (as the original was before it died), and it mostly just reinforces my feelings on the company: they seem to mean well, and most of their products are very well made (i have bluetooth headphones as well as a bluetooth speaker by them, and theyre both great)..I'd had issues with this battery from the start, and i'm pretty sure it's directly connected to the PowerIQ ""feature"" that's on here...I think I get what they're trying to do: they're trying to intelligently determine how much power is needed, in order to fiddle with quick charger or whatever. The problem with this is that some devices have such low power draw that it won't actually draw the power (my AirPod case, in this instance). When you first plug the cable in, it will start charging, but then it will peter off and not charge my low-draw device...Now the thing won't charge or turn on or anything. Kept it plugged in overnight, no dice. Tried many different cables, no dice. When I plug in a cable to charge it now the 4 LED lights light up sequentially (the 3rd one is dim, for whatever reason) and then turn back off. I've plugged it into my Kill-A-Watt and it is not drawing any power when I have this plugged into the wall to charge...I like Anker, I really do, but I'm pretty sure this is all due to a garbage microcontroller (ie, ""PowerIQ"") that fails after a time and basically won't allow the battery to charge. I may crack the thing open and see if the batteries are still good, at least.",1

Sometimes it will just charge when you plug something in but usually I have to tap the button.  Then when my phone gets to ~80% it will stop charging again.  If I had to guess I think the load sensing on this battery is buggy.  So if you sit there with it and press the button to force it on it's fine, but I can't rely on it to just plug in my phone and charge it to 100%.  It either won't charge it at all or will stop at 80%.  Not worth returning but not dependable enough to use regularly.",6

I was impressed with how quickly the battery charged my phone, and that the battery barely seemed to run down.  It's not very heavy; I didn't even notice that I was carrying it.  Note that it comes only with a cable to connect it to a USB port to charge the battery itself.  It does not have an electrical plug.  All the hotels I stayed in had USB charging ports by the beds so it worked well.  I think I could have used the small 'power brick' for my iPhone if I had to plug it into the wall.  I highly recommend this item. It's perfect for charging anything that plugs in with a standard USB.",0
5.0,,"December 1, 2018",Yes,"I just charged and put in my bag. I started using it almost 2 weeks after original charge, all lights indicated battery still had full charge. Plugged into my IPhone 7p at about 40% left on the phone battery. 30 minutes it’s up to 87% so I have to start using my phone again while still charging. Battery pack continues to charge phone until I hit 100% . Battery pack shows all lights which indicates still fully charged. Next day I basically have the same scenario and charging block shows one light off indicating 1/4 of block charge used. So for the price I would recommend it. Some of the negative reviews have been met with responses from the company offering a refund or a new unit. Also some folks said their cable would not fit and the charging cable didn’t fit either. My experience is it’s a tight fit. My Apple Speed charging cable works fine. Hopefully it will last and continue to give me a good experience but if not it does have an 18 month warranty with what I can see good customer service.",0
5.0,,"July 10, 2017",Yes,"I bought this charger to use at work with an iPhone 6s Plus.  It's great!  I go to conference rooms for meetings and don't take my charging stuff with me.  Instead, I take this charger and it's able to charge the phone at the same time I'm using it!  So when I leave the meeting, my phone has more charge than when the meeting started.  At my desk, I keep the charger plugged in to the wall so it's ready to go when I need it.  And since it's not expensive I don't have to worry about leaving it at work overnight...Only minor caveat is that the charging cable is short, so you might want to by a USB extension cable (like I did) if you don't have an outlet close by to plug it into...I've only had it for a week, no issues so far, if there are any I'll update my review.  Highly recommended!",2
5.0,,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"After buying &amp; charging the Anker 1000 last summer (2017), we put it in the emergency kit in our car. Which is where it stayed until yesterday, when our power was off for 12+ hours, it's now mid Nov. 2018. Due to redesigning multiple areas in our home, I was unable to find our home emergency charger ( different brand). So we got our Anker out of the car, but didn't hold much hope that it would have a charge. We weren't even sure it would work after 2 summers and 1+ winters of being in the car..To our surprise, it not only worked, on fast charge, 3 out of 4 lights were still on. My husband  &amp; I charged both our phones &amp; I  charged my tablet with the Anker, with 2 lights left!.I'm back to get another one which will go in our home emergency kit immediately after charging..After trying other brands, I would highly recommend this Anker 10000.",0
5.0,,"December 22, 2016",Yes,"Great unit.  I have been using the unit to recharge my Note 4 to test it out and its working just fine.  I haven't had time to deplete the phone and recharge from the Anker to determine how many recharges it has but given the capacity, and my needs, I think that it will handle whatever I will need it for, mostly while traveling on the plane, including in airports so I don't have to try and find the ever elusive AC outlets.....The unit came well packaged and contains a small carry case with a USB\Micro-USB cable for charging - very nice touch on both and makes it a complete package...At this point I am pro-Anker as all of the Anker products I have gotten to date have been very solid, well built and I believe a very good value and have come well packaged and presented.  I know that the presentation and packaging aren't really what I am needing, but for me when a company goes that extra step to present their product with nice packaging and the inclusion of the small things like a carry bag and cable that just build some confidence that the company is really thinking things through.",1
5.0,,"October 25, 2017",Yes,"How much do I like (love?) this device? Enough to order a replacement immediately after losing my original one. My Anker PowerCore 10000 can charge my Pixle, my wife's iPhone and a few other devices on a single charge. It has come in handy while traveling, going to sports events and being away from charging stations. I never worry as long as I have it with me. And, it's small enough to fit in my pocket. The BEST feature is that it will rapid charge my iOS and Pixel XL devices. 15 minutes on the charger and I can go a few hours. No other charger that I own does this! If you have rapid charge (Motorola, Samsung, Google, etc...) you need this charger! I was visiting Mt. Saint Helens NP and heard something fall when I was getting my hat from the trunk. I thought it was just my sun glasses. Not so. Someone in Washington was blessed with a GREAT device. I only hope they know what it is and get the proper use out of it. When I discovered it was gone, I immediately went online and ordered my replacement so it would be there when I got home from my vacation. Just glad I lost it at the end of the trip instead of the beginning.",0
5.0,,"October 15, 2017",Yes,"I first discovered the company Anker while shopping for an Iphone Charger. Anker came up and attracted me because they have braided phone chargers (i bought two of them). Anyway this was my third purchase from the company and i have not been disappointed. This charger is portable and works as i expected it. I bought this because we were traveling to Spain. I needed to have an extra or backup battery pack to charge my devices. To my surprise, this charger was able to give me 3-4 full charges on my cell phone, which was what i was looking for. They have a larger option, i would of purchased that one if i needed to charge my laptop and tablets...Happy with this purchase, highly recommend. You will not be disappointed! FYI i am not a paid rater. Just an honest average Joe.",1
5.0,,"August 10, 2018",Yes,"I bought this a year ago for my girlfriend as part of her birthday gift. I’ll admit at first she was unwhelmed by it, she had never heard of a portable charger and she felt like I found a way to waste money on something useless...Well once she finally decided to use it, she loved it! She realized that this little device gave her the ability to use her iPhone more freely throughout the day without fear of draining her battery completely.  She could leave her house, run errands for hours, spend hours on social media or the internet, texting etc and simply plug up her Anker charger in her pocket and charge on the go...It also became vital for long traveling trips, as it helped to charge phones or Kindle tablet for her daughter...She loved that it could fit in her pockets easily and wasn’t heavy or bulky...*what also made this an even better purchase was the fact that her car’s charging ports no longer charge.",0
5.0,,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"This power bank is fantastic. I bought it for a trip since the battery on my iPhone usually doesn’t last the day when I’m using it regularly. This has at least two and a half charges in it, and works perfectly. It’s the most useful thing I brought on vacation. It’s the size of my wallet too, so I could carry it in my pocket if I wanted. Absolutely love it. I have purchased three Anker products and all of them have been really great products.",2
2.0,,"September 16, 2017",Yes,I have had a few portable battery chargers over the years but never an Anker. I decided to give it a try because of a deal they were running. I brought this with me on a recent trip out if the country and I would likely need a charger as we were doing activities away from an outlet. I charged it up right before I left and used it to fill my Galaxy S8+ up from 10% to full one day and then 2 days later I was at 2% and went to juice it back up and it only got to 43%. The S8+ battery is 3500 mAh. This should theoretically provide me with 2+ charges. But only provided me with ~1.5. Not worth it. Get a Jackery branded one. I've had 2(1 made for a charge and half and one made for about 3 charges on this phone)  for over 2 years and they are still around 90% correct.,3
5.0,,"January 7, 2019",Yes,"Used for international travel where USB wasn’t available to charge my phone. Able to get 3 full charges on my iPhone Xs. Comes with a nice bag that has room for my phone USB cord in addition to included charging cord and battery pack. Full bag has locking drawstring and small size tucks into my day bag easily. Well made easy to use, recharges in a couple hours. Highly recommend, would buy as a gift for any traveler. Most international hotels hav USB charging ports, this eliminates need for international converter to charge phone.",1
2.0,,"February 4, 2019",Yes,I bought this to replace my Jackery that I had for over 3 years. It’s starting to only charge my phone once before I have to charge it again so I decided to purchase this Anker product. I wish I’d used it more within the first 30 days because I would have noticed that it’s not charging my phone more that 2 - 2 1/2 times per charge and it’s twice the size of my Jackery. It takes a very long time to charge and doesn’t hold anywhere near the amount of juice I had expected. I’m very disappointed and wish I could return it and go back to Jackery.,1
5.0,,"April 1, 2018",Yes,"It took over five hours to charge my Samsung S7 phone.  How is that ""fast?!""  Really disappointed..UPDATE:  I contacted Anker and they immediately responded. I thought the issue might have been the the battery itself or the Anker cord I was using. The customer service at Anker is AMAZING!!  Since it was under an 18 month warranty, they sent me a new battery AND cable, without question.  I received it within five days of my initial contact.  The new battery is charged and working great.  My Samsung phone charged up in a little over 2 hours--and it was almost dead.  When I checked the Anker battery, there were still three lights lit up to indicate more than half of the battery still remained.  I'm guessing I can charge my phone twice before recharging the battery.  It's comapct, affordable and works great--backed by a fantastic customer service!  FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!!",0
5.0,,"November 17, 2017",Yes,"OMG! This is the best no-nonsense charger we have and we have a lot. Brought this as a replacement for another one my son dropped, and we love it because it:..- auto charges a phone without having to push a button.- doesn't have an unnecessary flashlight that accidentally comes on all the time.- it's super small and lightweight.- it can charge up just about any phone twice.- it has passthrough charging so you can charge it while it's plugged into your phone.- it knows to stop charging itself when the battery is topped off..I'm getting one for myself and leaving my larger Anker one a home for emergencies only.",1
5.0,,"November 18, 2017",Yes,"It worked great for about 6 months.  Now it will not charge. There are four lights that help tell you how much it is charged. Now while it is plugged in, it just flashes the first light all night. So disappointing. I’ll have to buy another one but not this brand...ADDENDUM:..After seeing the review that I posted in November 2017, the company personally contacted me. They then proceeded to immediately send me a replacement with no questions asked. They contacted me at the beginning of December and I had the new replacement within the week. It works great again, and I hope that it will last longer than 6 months. I think it might have just been a faulty battery. Between the time the company contacted me and my review, I even purchased another reputable brand, and it just didn't stack up to this one. I hope the first episode was a fluke because this charger is fantastic. It pretty much will charge my iPhone up to 3 times without me having to recharge. No other similarly priced product comes close.",2
5.0,,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"The first thing to note is that this charger is VERY efficient--it's small for its mAh rating and charges my phone very quickly (although not as quickly as using the phone's fast charger and a wall socket). It is the perfect size to go with you for a long day on the go or on a long flight and has plenty of juice to get the job done...Secondly, Anker's customer service is phenomenal. Unfortunately, my charger stopped working after about 2 months of heavy use (not sure if this is common at all but I think mine was just defective) and they promptly answered my inquiry about it and shipped me a new one. Fantastic service!!",2
4.0,,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"So I love this little guy.  He charges my phone very fast and he takes some time to charge himself but who cares, he charges my phone to 100% and when you're caught out there with a dying battery, this little guy comes in handy so much! It's almost a travel necessity to have!  Unfortunately he is quite heavy and bulky in my small purse which is my only complaint.  If I could have a smaller version of him with a thinner frame I would be happier.  I had to purchase a less quality but thinner charger just so it could fit in my purse comfortably alongside my phone when I'm not doing heavy traveling and just need a charger for a quick charge every now and then.  Otherwise, when you really need to depend on a charger for a complete charge up, this is THE charger to have!",0

I stopped using this sll-together before a month. so while it's priced better than several other options. As we all know. You get what you pay for.

5.0,,"January 16, 2018",Yes,"So far, so good. This thing is simplistic, feels solidly built, and performs well for it's intended use. I really enjoy that the power levels can be tested by simply clicking the button on the side, and that it comes with a nice mesh case to prevent scratching. One issue I could see would be that there is no USB-C port. For any users of specific android phones, there might be no USB charging cable present anymore, but rather a USB-C to USB-C cable. For users with such phones and accessories, this might not be for you. However, for anyone with a USB-charging cable, this does the job, and feels well made, without being overly heavy. Definitely recommended!",1
1.0,,"March 21, 2019",Yes,"This battery pack WAS amazing! It was perfect for traveling, I even recommended it to people.... But I only used it occasionally for a few months, and now it won't charge past the 2nd light. I am very disappointed! I definitely expected this to last much longer than a few months.",3
5.0,,"July 25, 2018",Yes,"I heard about this through a 10 year old who cleaned my house so he could buy one at Best Buy.  They didn't have it there, but I found it on Amazon and decided to buy it for my niece who can NEVER keep her S6 charged up.  I flew with it to give it to her in Virginia and it was so handy (yes, I opened it and used the gift) and really was a lot of charge, I bought one for myself..It doesn't come with a fast charge cable, but those aren't too hard to find.  It kept my phone charged but more importantly my tablet that I was watching movies on the whole 7 hours.  It didn't just keep the battery steady, it charged it while I played the movie.  I bought the 2nd one as a Prime Day deal, but I would have paid the original price.",0
5.0,,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"Perfect.  I bought this for a trip out of state where I knew I'd be doing a lot of sightseeing and photography and wouldn't have an opportunity to charge my phone.  I used it on the beach, at the zoo, in the car, everywhere.  I'd say it can do 2-2.5 charges of my iPhone from about 15% battery remaining.  I never let my phone run completely down so I can't attest to that.  My family loved it so much that we were passing it around the whole trip and I was having to recharge it every night!  It became such a hot item that my mother-in-law ordered one before we even got home and it was waiting for her when she returned.",1
5.0,,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"This is a great charger! As soon as I received this I charged my phone (iphone6+) and I charged this overnight. I have now gone a whole week and there is still a bit of power left in the charger. This will be great for weekend camping trips / get away weekends. It carries so much power and it's really easy to use. SO glad I got this! I plan to visit my daughter in Europe this winter. I was wondering about the different voltage in Europe and how I was going to charge my phone while there. With this, I should be able to get thru most of the trip without having to plug in anywhere.

It is really a battery hog. The game drained our iPhone Xs Plus phones completely. We were both able to completely charge our phones twice and the charger wasn't even drained. It comes with a little mesh pouch that held the charger, charger cord (included) and my phone charger cord (not included). It keeps everything together and super portable. This is the best charger on the market. My two daughters and a friend liked it so much that they had to buy them too!",0
5.0,,"January 8, 2017",Yes,"Wonderful surprise! Compact, long-lasting, portable power source. The price was great. I had purchased a ""MyBolt"" by IEnjoy 3-4 years ago. It was a typical low price, low quality cheapo offered by Groupon. You get what you pay for. It was 2800mAh... which isn't even enough to provide one charge on todays smart phones. Plus, if I didn't use it for 7-10 days, it would lose its charge. I can take the Anker PowerCore 10000mAh to work with me and have enough power to recharge my cell phone and my Bluetooth stereo headphones 3-4 times each throughout the week. And then recharge the unit on the weekend. This is the third Anker product I have owned, and all have offered premium quality and durability. Always trust this brand and make a purchase. Spend a little extra and get a LOT more in return.",1
5.0,,"July 10, 2017",Yes,"I love this thing! I've had it for a while now, and it's holding up really well. I just took it camping for a week and I got six full iPhone charges out of it (4 charges for my iPhone SE and two charges for my friend's iPhone 7) and it still has juice left. I like that it doesn't have any buttons that can accidentally get pushed in my backpack that would turn it on and drain it. It automatically turns on when you plug a usb cable into it (just remember to unplug it when you're done charging because the battery pack stays on as long as something is plugged in, even if the phone isn't connected to it). As others stated, it's about the size of a credit card, but fatter and heavier. Well worth the weight, though. And a great way to make friends!",8
5.0,,"August 30, 2017",Yes,"Recently bought this for a trip to France and it was all I could've hoped for! The power capacity is incredible for the size, which is small enough to easily fit in a pocket or small bag. While it advertises being able to charge an iPhone 6s 3.5 times from empty, that more accurately means you can recharge a phone with 50% power 7 times, since most people wouldn't let their phone get all the way to zero before charging it. I have an iPhone 7 and also love playing the battery-draining Pokemon Go, so I was able to explore Paris and other cities without ever having to worry about running out of power no matter how much I played. I don't think I ever even emptied this battery 50% even if I was out all day. I highly recommend this battery and will probably be buying it for friends and family for Christmas!",2
1.0,,"March 1, 2019",Yes,"I'm sorry to say I was incredibly disappointed with this product. I purchased 4 of them as Christmas presents for my family and none of them after the 1st use were able to recharge. I used the cord that came with the charger as well as my own cord and they still would not recharge. So I basically wasted my money on a portable chargers but you not hold a charge. I could understand if it was just one of them, but it was in fact all 4 chargers that did not recharge after their 1st use.",1
5.0,,"October 26, 2017",Yes,"Love the small size and quality of manufacture. It's my first battery power bank and I'm totally impressed. On a full charge, I was able to charge my Motorola Moto G2 smart phone, ASUS Z580CA Zenpad, and my wife's Samsung Tab A tablet and there was still one diode lit showing that I still had some power remaining. I wanted to have a power bank to keep in my car so that I can charge my phone when its power reserve gets too low. I keep it in my console when not in use. It will also be good for traveling when on an airplane during distant travel. I use my Anker wall charger and cable to charge this power bank. I'm a fan of the Anker brand because of its quality in reliability and performance. I'm thinking of getting another one for our other car so that I know it's readily accessible. I also like the little sack it comes with for storage. Highly recommend this battery power bank from Anker.",0
5.0,,"January 9, 2019",Yes,"I recently took this on a week long vacation, where I realized how convenient this power bank is. In real world use, this power bank can reliably charge my iPhone 7 around 3-4 times. During this vacation, I passed around this power bank between family member and family member, keeping us all at comfortable battery percentages all day every day. However, what really made this power bank so convenient was its physical size. This thing is really small! It's significantly smaller than my iPhone 7, making it very easy to keep in pocket during use...Another thing to note about the charger is that the chassis is plastic, meaning that it feels slightly less premium. This personally doesn't matter to me, but I do enjoy how durable this makes the power bank. I've dropped it multiple times, and have seen no physical damage to the chassis at all.",1

It's actually more compact than it seems in the picture. Easily fits in my jeans pocket...It came with around 50% charge (2 LEDs). I ordered a 2.4 A wall charger separately. It took about two and a half hours to fully charge the PowerCore 10000. After full charge, all LEDs were off. If you have a wall charger with lower output or if you use or computer's USB port to charge the PowerCore, it might take quite a while to recharge it...The travel pouch is made of good material. The package included a MicroUSB charging cable. Therefore, if your phone has a microUSB charging port, you can use the same cable to charge it. However, for iPhones and latest Android phones with USB-C ports, you will need appropriate cables, which are not included...The battery pack has retained charge really well so far. When I used it to charge my iPhone 7, the phone was recharged very fast, which is normal considering the PowerCore's 2.4 A output. Although, my phone got a bit warm during charging...I have previously used a battery pack from Xiaomi and the experience was not good.  So far this one has served me well. However, it's still too soon to comment on its durability. I will use it for a couple months and then post an update...** (Bought it with my own money. No discount) **",7

They wrote back almost immediately and after trying a few toubleshooting tips, could not get the charger to work. They sent me a replacement the next day and the new one works perfectly. I also own an Anker Soundcore speaker and a Powercore 15600 portable charger which work flawlessly. I really commend Anker as a company and their customer service department for being so helpful in fixing my unfortunate defect. They have earned a customer for life, and I would (and have) recommend their brand to anyone. The products work great, charge fast, and my Soundcore speaker has a phenomenal battery life.

The padded mesh bag serves it purpose very well...Overall it takes me a few days to fully discharge this battery pack, i know it could charge my phone (galaxy S5) up to 100% nearly 4 times, a little big for pockets, but not uncomfortable. If you had a car or backpack to keep this in then it completely unnoticeable.",2
5.0,,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"I have no idea how I got through life before this little gem!  This thing is a great size, and hold plenty of juice for an impressive amount of time!  I've had this for almost two months now, and have been carrying it around with me because my phone is over 2 years old, and I've trashed the battery (Yes, my phone is beautiful, but I can't replace the battery).  I've only gotten down to two (out of four) lights once.  The size is perfect for one person...in the car, or in a cargo pocket, or purse.  Anker makes fantastic products!",1
5.0,,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"At first I thought this item would be an impulse buy, but a year later I have my entire family using them. These chargers are light and easily transported--we pretty much always have at least one with us. They provide at least four charges to our iPhones and the units charge within a few hours after being depleted. I had one unit fail after a year of use, but Anker quickly sent a replacement unit upon being contacted. I believe the faulty unit is in the minority, and I would recommend this charger without hesitation.",1
5.0,,"March 5, 2019",Yes,"I bought this product because I had a battery problem with my previous portable charger. When it arrived, it was already at around 50%. I plugged my iPhone XR in and it charged from 23% to 100% in about 2 hours. The battery has lasted me 2 days of constant use without a recharge. The only downside is that if you have the portable charger charging and plug your device into it, your device won't charge unless you stop charging the portable charger. Overall, amazing battery life.",2
5.0,,"June 22, 2017",Yes,"Brilliant solution to get my old failing iphone through the last little stretch before I could upgrade, while its battery was dying swiftly in regular weather and instantly in anything under 50 degrees.  Compact enough I can hold it easily at the same time in the same hand as the phone and solid enough it's survived several clumsy drops.  Now I've upgraded phones, the charger is still useful for trips and for my weekend sales booth needs where I use Square to sell my jewelry work and I can't have the phone attached to a back wall or computer charging while I'm trying to do sales.  Getting a second one now for a failsafe for a huge upcoming convention so if we're run so ragged we forget to charge things at night we are still a-ok.",1
4.0,,"September 28, 2017",Yes,"This just arrived ... however it is taking hours and hours to charge up using the beefy (2.1A) charger that came with my iPad..So far it's been charging 3-4 hours and the charging status has gone from 2 to 3 lights.  I thought it was supposed to charge quickly..Update: The unit did charge completely on my 2.1A iPad charger, in about 6 or 7 hours which is consistent with the manufacturer's comments below.  For some reason I thought the unit would charge up faster but if I'm in a hotel, 6 or 7 hours overnight should do the trick before I'm back on the road.",1
4.0,,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I normally don't write reviews. This may be my first, I bought my battery about a year ago, at first it would get me a about 4 charges on my iPhone 6S+ when it had a full charge. After about a year I was lucky to get two, then I was bummed. I decided to reach out to the company remembering it had an 18 month warranty. After maybe 2 emails with minimal effort they sent me a brand new replacement, without me having to return the old one. The rep even reached out to me a week after receiving it just to check to see if the replacement worked well enough. Awesome customer service. Would for sure but again considering the price/convenience of having FULL charges for nearly a year. Thanks again.",1
5.0,,"June 12, 2018",Yes,"I have to say, I didn't know how much I needed this little thing until I got it. I travel a lot for work, and it's become absolutely indispensable to me. As you probably have noticed if you fly a lot, most airport terminals service hundreds or thousands of passengers a day... and for some reason, most of them have like 4 plugs. You don't have to worry about hunting one down anymore with this guy. As advertised, it seems to be good for about 5-6 charges of my iPhone 6s, which means I might not have to find power for days (and I often don't)...I don't really have any gripes. Just realize that to charge it to capacity takes a while. You basically have to leave it overnight. Makes sense, as you're storing a lot of power in this thing, so I'm not really worried about it. I top up when I'm near a power source. Haven't noticed any battery memory issues at all. Also, no issues yet with 240V power or ""dirty""/spotty power sources, though that might be down to the wall-wart that I use with it (Careful, I melted one once... make sure you get a good quality ""wall wart"" charger made for the country you're in rather than trying to chain together various adapters. It takes 5V power over mini-USB, so pretty standard)...Overall, great purchase for the money.",0
5.0,,"November 10, 2017",Yes,"This product is great. It held it's charge well and had high capacity. Unfortunately after almost a year, it stopped functioning - would tell me it was charged fully, but when I unplugged it, it said it was empty and wouldn't charge any devices...However, Sharon with Anker Customer Service was awesome! I initially asked for a replacement, but when I asked her about the warranty, she said it would be a continuation of the previous warranty, and so offered to refund instead so that I could re-purchase the product. Excellent!..I also own many other anker products (car quick charger, micro-usb cables, kickstand for ipad, phone cradle for GPS in the car - all of them are top-notch! So, I have no doubt that my experience with this particular device failing was an anomaly to the norm.",1
1.0,,"December 24, 2018",Yes,"I used this one time and it was great. It would not charge the second time and when I pulled out the charger from the unit it came loose and part of the connection got stuck inside the unit. Total garbage. Can’t return because it’s past the return window. $32 down the drain..UPDATE: after posting this review, Anker reached out to me and offered to replace the unit free of charge despite being past the return window. We’ll see how it works this time but customer service gets 5 stars. They were very helpful and committed to making things right",2
5.0,,"December 16, 2017",Yes,"I've had this for awhile now. It has lost a lot of its ability to carry a good charge but I've gotten a lot of use out of it for recharging my iPad and iPhone. When it was new, it could almost fully charge my iPad and could charge my phone more than once. These days, it has gotten a bit weaker but still has lasted quite a lot of uses. These days, you can get chargers with more juice than this but this is very lightweight in comparison to many of my other chargers, so it's still my preferred charger.",1
5.0,,"June 26, 2018",Yes,"Modified review, July 6, 2018.Amazing customer service!  Two days after I posted the original review, I got email from Anker saying that it “had come to their attention” that I was having problems with my unit, and they offered to send me a new one.  I of course accepted.  It got here 2 days later and works fine.  In fact, the blue lights make sense this time—lights blink while charging and are steady when it is being used to charge my phone, with each light meaning 25% of charge.  So perhaps my original unit had 2 problems and was just a defective unit.  Anyway, I am happy now...The general quality of Anker products—I have bought a number of them—and this kind of customer service is what makes me want to always buy Anker if I can… they delight the customer.  I saw somewhere that Anker just released new over-the-ear headphones (<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Anker-Soundcore-Space-NC-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-with-Touch-Control-20-Hour-Playtime-Foldable-Design-for-Travel-Work-and-Home/dp/B07BBNS8N5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anker Soundcore Space NC Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Touch Control, 20-Hour Playtime, Foldable Design for Travel, Work, and Home</a>), for ⅓ the price of the wonderful Bose ones…  maybe I should try those now [I still cannot spend $350 for the Bose ones]!..Original review, June 26, 2018:.It was OK while it worked, but about after about 9 months, it just stopped working.  And I found the meaning of the lights confusing—can it really be so hard to convey ""nearly out of power"" or  ""being charged now &amp; half done"" in a 100% obvious manner.  Not with the blue lights this battery has.  I have had really good experience with other  Anker products, so they should get their act together on this one.",0
2.0,,"July 23, 2017",Yes,"This has come in extremely handy. Takes a long time to charge up, but then I can pretty much charge my phone three times before charging it again..UPDATE:.Four months in, it stopped charging. Worked well while it lasted. Just wish it would last longer than 4 months.",3
5.0,,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"The best portable charger ever! I used to waste time when I had to go out or be somewhere on time due to my phone not being completely charged. Well let me tell you not anymore. My phone can be 54% charged or less and I don't have to wait around while it charges. I simply connect my phone to the portable charger in my purse and go! By the time I need to use my phone it's fully charged! I truly recommend this charger to anyone on the go, it's compact, simple to use and easy to charge. It comes in a protective pouch and a short cable for easy carrying. I love it and thank you for saving me so much time!",0
5.0,,"January 24, 2019",Yes,"Been using this portable charge for a couple months now and I can't see how I survived without it!  It keeps my phone charged (with my normal usage) for 5+ days when normally I have to charge my phone a minimum of once a day.  It is also very hardy.  I've dropped and even gotten mine wet (not dunked in water, it was wrapped up in something wet), but it continues to survive!  The only issue I have run into so far is that if it completely discharges, it can take extra time to get it fully charged again.",0
5.0,,"April 5, 2019",Yes,"I ordered this product roughly two years ago and have had absolutely no issues with charging it. I bring it to work and it impressed my coworkers so much that they bought one too. Then my mom saw it and loved the idea of it, and so we bought another charger! 10/10 can not recommend this enough for personal use.",1
5.0,,"June 5, 2018",Yes,"I use this when I'm out playing Pokemon Go, I typically let my battery drain down to about 30% and then plug this in. I usually return with a full battery. I also bring it on business trips where I need my phone to stay charged. I have no complaints, so far it has worked as advertised, one nice thing about it is that it automatically turns on when you plug your phone into it. Great item, easy to use.",1
5.0,,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this on a deal to replace an old one that no longer works (different brand). This one has worked really well for me and I love it! It holds a charge well and I can get almost 2 full charges for my Stylo 3. I have also used it with my fire tablet and my boyfriend's phone and it works really well with each device. I love being able to have this in my purse in case my phone is close to dying. It also comes with a cord that works with android devices and a little carry pouch for it. I was hesitant to purchase because I didn't know the brand, but I am so glad I did. I would highly recommend it!",0
5.0,,"June 15, 2018",Yes,One of the best purchases I've ever made. I am an iphone user. I'm sure fellow iphone users can relate to the insane battery use required by the phone if you use multiple apps. This battery will let me charge my phone multiple times. I carry it everywhere. I just tuck in the charger that it comes with and my iphone charging wire with the battery into the little pouch it comes with the battery. This thing has no gimmicks (why do other small chargers have flashlights? so unnecessary). It just has a button to see if it's charged and four lights to show the charge status. It does take some time to charge but it's totally worth it.,0
5.0,,"July 16, 2018",Yes,"I have portable chargers that are smaller than this but don't have enough power, and one that is so large and heavy that I avoid taking it with me. This one is the perfect size and not too heavy so I can just throw it in any bag and not have to worry about my phone dying. This is really the perfect medium of power and portability that a charger should be!",1

This external battery was a lifesaver.  it kept both my phone and my husbands phone fully charge and still had over half of it's battery power after being used all day.  It takes a while to full charge the battery pack, but it is worth it.  Will follow up with my review as time goes on, but very happy with my purchase as of now.",0
4.0,,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"I've had this about a year but I've only used it when I travel.  I used it to charge my phone and digital cameras and I'm always so glad to have this in my bag.  I charge it up fully before I leave and it usually will last me for a 3 day trip without having to plug it up again. So far there's been no major glitches and I'm surprised by the mixed review.  Sometimes it doesn't read my phone when I attach it to my phone to charge, but if I just detach and reattach the phone cord, it fixes that issue.",0

The other one has quit.  You know how kids use their phones until they are completely dead and probably need them more for contacting family than adults do (Mom, I ran out of gas, or Gramma, can you come pick me up... you know :), and we want to keep track of where they are too, so having an external power source for charging is useful.  Since this one is doing such a good job, I'm buying another.",0

5.0,,"July 3, 2018",Yes,"Hello there,.It's great to see a company stand behind their product. I really love their power banks. I have both this one and  a larger one. I used the larger one on the trip we just went on. Since the smaller one broke right before the trip we bought a different brand charger to take its place.  That charger was terrible! It made me even more appreciate the quality and function of Anker's product. Anker even replaced my broken power bank!  What I have experienced with Anker is quality, function and great customer service. They really nailed it!",0
5.0,,"July 25, 2017",Yes,"Anker's products are generally very high quality, and this little battery pack is no exception. My two issues with other portable chargers have been lack of significant charge and lack of durability, and this pack definitely has both - It hasn't been damaged or destroyed after multiple rigorous camping trips, and it consistently holds over 3 complete iPhone 7 plus charges. It also charges very quickly, which is important to myself and many other on-the-go charger users. Combined with the fact that it's very small and easy to carry around in a pocket makes me use it more often than my larger Anker battery core. I can even fit it in the breast pocket of my suit and charge while at work or at more formal dress events.",0
5.0,,"July 23, 2018",Yes,"I've already used this several times to completely recharge my Samsung S7. Easily 3 charges on a full battery. It's like having 2 extra batteries! Goodbye long charger wires and plugs everywhere! Simple and compact and one cord for everything...Note* It doesn't say its ""fast charging"" on my phone, but the time remaining to ""full charge"" is less than that of my original fast charger. So yes...it does fast charging. And no...it doesn't make my phone freak out and tell me to use the original charger like some batteries do. Real deal!",0
5.0,,"June 10, 2018",Yes,"Quick charging, compact, great product. What's even better? Their customer service. I've had this product for *just* under 18 months and the charging plug stopped connecting. I read another person's review that commended the customer service, looked on the Anker site and saw that they have an 18 month warranty on product defects. Checked the purchase date and I'm about 17 months and 2 weeks into the product. I contacted Anker customer service, got the amazing CS rep, Sharon, who not only thoroughly answered my questions, but replaced my product with a fantastic refurb. I've purchased many Anker products based on the quality (I currently have 3 battery packs for different uses and about 15 charging cords strewn around the house and in my car) and I will continue purchasing on the strength of their customer service and pride in their products. Get all the things!",1
5.0,,"December 15, 2017",Yes,"Awesome. One cord allows you to charge devices and the charger, too! About the size of a pack of cards, and the cord is long. You can charge something while using it. Just plug it in to a computer or other device's USB port and recharge it, no batteries needed unlike some standalone chargers..I'm ecstatic about this purchase, charging everything from phones and tablets to electronic cigarettes..Just got it today and I've charged three things right away, then plugged in to laptop and recharged the charger!",1
4.0,,"February 2, 2018",Yes,"I got this to use as a battery pack for a Raspberry Pi 3, which I am using to control a Dash robot via bluetooth. As an initial test, I decided to see how long it can run the Pi on a full charge. After 22 hours, the powerbank still shows half charge, which is great! The robot itself only has a few hours of battery life, so with well over 24 hours this will suit my purposes quite well...This review would be 5 stars if it had the ability to charge while still powering the Pi (pass-through), because then it could be used as a backup power supply for a solar-powered Pi project.  But, there are solar powerbanks that work for that, and I don't need that for my project here.",1

A couple months ago my phone was giving me a slow charging alert when plugged into the battery. A couple weeks later and I realized that my phone battery was still draining in my pocket despite slow charging. I tried charging the battery all the way up to no avail...Disappointing because the product performed well up to this point. I purchase Anker thinking the quality would be better, not expecting to need to replace it on a year.",2
5.0,,"July 5, 2018",Yes,"Takes a while to charge, but keeps the charge well (after several months no noticeable change). Recharges our phones faster than being plugged into the wall (per my wife). Love having these around.",2

I take it on day hikes, backpacks and camping trips where I won't have the ability to charge my device.

5.0,,"July 2, 2017",Yes,"I have other anker products such as a 5 port IQ charger and charging cables.  They are very well made and preform as they claim. When I decided to get a battery pack I knew Anker would be the go to brand. I looked at their various models and decided this would be a good choice for size and capacity. So far its been fantastic. It is very light and small, feels well built too. Fits easily in my pocket with my phone. It easily gets me through a day of heavy usage and it also charges the phone very quickly.. A few minor complaints would be I'd prefer if it were a little wide and thinner to lie flatter in a pocket. Pass through charging would be nice too..Overall though very happy with purchase. It's a good value from a solid company. Don't want to sound like a paid reviewer (I'm not) but with so much junk out there it's important for people to know who makes quality products. Anker is one of those companies",1

It has good reviews, so I figured why not?..I was not disappointed!! This charger is amazing. It charges up super fast and holds the charge for a long time. It charges your phone very fast. The only downside is, if you have an iPhone 6, you can only charge the charger with the black cord that it comes with; you cannot charge it with a regular iPhone cable. Other than that, this is great charger and I highly recommend it!",2
5.0,,"August 29, 2017",Yes,"While some will insist that the Pure Experience Of Nature™ is tainted by use of electronics, I call BS. When pack weight is at a premium, why not have one device that can serve as a camera, book, music/podcast player, GPS, journal, internet-when-available, and (yes) phone?..Lest we forget what I am actually reviewing, the Anker PowerCore 10000 does none of that – it is just a boring black box. However, it will charge up the thing that does all of those things (in my case, an iPhone 6s) 4-ish times, at approximately plug-into-wall speed. I bought it to take on hikes – IE a couple days at a time away from a wall outlet. But since it is small and lightweight, I find myself carrying it around in normal life too. I barely notice it in my bag, and I never get the dreaded dead phone anymore. Just, uh, don't tell anyone who sends me nighttime work emails that, ok?..There are more powerful batteries, and there are smaller ones, but this one seems to strike a good balance. It is well designed and seems pretty sturdy. It has convenient LED lights to tell you how much charge it has left. This thing is great. I'm sorry I called it a boring black box.",1

Had a 10 hour drive with  the phone on the PowerCore, and it only consumed 1 of 4 bars of the charge.  Amazing.  Definitely happy with the purchase.  However, it is heavier than the low power options, so if you just need an emergency backup for 1 or 2 charges, it probably is not worth carrying the extra weight of this unit.

Then after having charged it a few hours earlier, I tried charging my Iphone with it. The lights just flashed on it. Changed the chord, same thing. Tried a different Iphone, same thing. Tried charging a pair of bluetooth earbuds, same thing. So I got a hold of the company and asked about the warranty replacement. They asked if I had done all of the above troubleshooting things and I said yep. They said just send us a picture of the battery itself (the serial number on the bottom was wore off) and we will have a replacement out to you as soon as possible. I received it in just a couple days! Even if the product doesnt last as long as it should, at least they stand behind their warranty! I'll definitely look to use them in the future since it was such an easy process..On a side note. I wonder what their testing processes are for these. Whenever I used mine it was in my pocket. So Im guessing it might have caused it more stress being warmer then just being able to sit out on a table or chair. Thing is when Im on the move, I dont have the ability to put it anywhere else. I think heat testing might need to be done a little more rigorously, but those are just my thoughts.",0

I would have unplug and plug it in again and then it would start charging again.  However, it would turn off again after a few minutes..

Nothing worked, so I concluded that the problem was with the PowerCore...I contacted the Anker support team because my product was under their 18-month warranty. They sent me a new charger at no cost to me, and so far it works like a dream! EXCELLENT customer service. Highly recommended!!",1
5.0,,"October 18, 2018",Yes,"I am terribly disappointed. I bought this through Amazon Prime only 2-months ago and it just stopped working. One moment it was charging great; then the next time I picked it up to charge, it just failed. I really hope Anker is able to help me exchange this through Amazon for a replacement. I am willing to give it one more chance considering it got really good reviews. Apparently, I got a lemon..Update: I changed my rating to 5-stars because Anker immediately contacted me and replaced the defective product with a new one. I really appreciate the great customer service! I hope this one lasts like the others I have read about. I am hopeful it will.",1
5.0,,"May 24, 2017",Yes,"this battery sits in a pouch on the back of my helmet to power my GoPro when I play airsoft. It works great and lasts almost an entire day of filming. My one gripe... If you turn your GoPro completely off, you will have to push the button on the battery to get it to power back on. Doing this when it's resting on the back of your head with gloves on, etc can be difficult.",2
5.0,,"June 4, 2018",Yes,"I LOVE this charger. It's the best phone accessory I ever bought. It is so small for its capacity, charges phones fast with 2.4A output, and holds its charge for weeks while not in use. No more worrying about power at amusement parks or long plane flights. I've also used it in hotel rooms for bedside charging when there wasn't an outlet on my side. Then I just charge it back up during the day. The only catch with this model is that you can only charge one device at a time. That works for me, so it's not a problem. Great product!",0
5.0,,"August 27, 2017",Yes,"I tend to stress my tablet and phone to the point of being unable to get a full day's use from them.  This will top both off in a reasonable time and still have some left over. I often take my largely depleted tablet to bed to read with this plugged in while reading and then set them on the nightstand, and in the morning the tablet is fully charged again.  Before this, I needed an extension cord draped across the floor and bed to keep the tablet going.",1
4.0,,"October 23, 2016",Yes,"So, I thought my product stopped charging correctly.. come to find out,  product was fine...it was another cord that came with it.  Only issue is, after taking it into the sprint store-it charged at a different rate than the factory Samsung S8. Charges.  They advised me that It could fry ther circuits ok on my phone by using an aftermarket charger- which would probably void my warrenty.. She said she seen it happen. Now I just use this charger for other products. Up to you if you want to take the chance.  Overall a good product,  and Anker  followed up with me promptly- helped me with trouble shooting. I recommend,  but do your research to make sure it's ok for your phone.",1
5.0,,"February 28, 2017",Yes,"Purchased for my teen son for Xmas. Like many kids he has a busy schedule and benefits from having a powerbank on hand. Most notably, a major convenience when at all day swim meets where outlets are scarce. He told me it deserves a 5 Star rating. His LG G4 can get nearly 3 full charges; a bit less if he is using the phone while charging. It charges quickly too. Nearly fully charged in an hour from 10% battery life. We have several Anker brand products and all are high quality.",2
5.0,,"April 15, 2019",Yes,"As a family of four with many different digital devices, we own our fair share of different power banks. These Anker 10,000mAh battery packs seem to get the most use and are still going strong. One is almost 2 years old now. If given a choice, my kids will always grab these ones first. There's no flashlights or gimicky display, just a good sized battery pack with plenty of juice and a sensible little set of 4 leds to indicate remaining charge.",0
5.0,,"August 3, 2017",Yes,"This is the third one of these I've ordered. I use mine for commuting, camping, and just to have on hand if needed. It's great when the power goes out and your phone is at 3%. So far I get at least four charges on my iPhone before I need to recharge my Anker. Also, the first one I ordered didn't work after three chargings and Anker sent me a replacement at no cost. You can't put a price on excellent customer service. (The replacement plus the other two have been working awesomely with no issues.)",1
5.0,,"January 3, 2018",Yes,"Worked great for a few months. It now will not consistently charge my phone.  Seems to have a short circuit, or something similar. I will NOT purchase this product again...Since my initial post, Anker contacted me. We decided the issue was with the charging cable &amp; they will be sending me a replacement. Thank you, Anker, for being a responsive, customer-friendly, accountable company!!",1
1.0,,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"My sister bought me this charger for my Birthday.,..it died just before Christmas.",17
5.0,,"March 13, 2019",Yes,"This thing holds lots of power, I’ve owned it for a few weeks now and have only needed to recharge it once, and that’s after using it about every other day. Small and compact, I throw it in my backpack and never have to worry about my phone dying. I can be gone for easily 12 hours in a day without heading back home so it’s nice to be able to rely on it. Overall for the price you can’t be beat.",1
5.0,,"May 5, 2018",Yes,I use this to supply power to a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It will likely provide power for many days if not weeks. I use the Zero as a wireless model rocket launcher (via gpio and a web page and powering and attaching some relays to the RPi Zero header). In addition it can easily run a RPi 3PB+ for hours and hours. I put an OnOff Shim on the Zero to make it easy to shutdown the RPi Zero with a press of a button. Of course with a ssh session I can shutdown from the command line wirelessly too. The Anker notes the lack of power draw after a shutdown and automatically powers off.,0
5.0,,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"I thought this was a battery, but it's apparently made of actual magic. I partially charged mime three weeks ago. Since then, I've used it to charge my dead phone twice, once I left the phone plugged into it all night; I've charged my Bose wireless headphones and the charging pad they came with; and I'm currently charging my phone again with this thing right now...I've only had this thing plugged in once since I bought it, and its performance is physics-defying...Buy this.",1
5.0,,"December 23, 2018",Yes,"I carry one of these in my pocket every day, which gives me a boost if I happen to be out and about for an extended period of time. I have used these to charge my Android phone as well as friends' iPhones, and to power little gadgets like a USB reading light. It's not QuickCharge compatible but still charges most phones pretty quickly...I had some issues with two earlier chargers (they appeared to draw too much current during charging, causing the MicroUSB charge cables to fuse to the socket and releasing a burning smell). I only use Anker products, so this happened with an Anker PowerPort 5 charger and the PowerCore 10000. Luckily, Anker support quickly resolved the issue and sent me replacements. It must have been specific to a batch as I haven't had any issues since.",0
3.0,,"January 29, 2019",Yes,"Purchased Aug 8 2017..Product has not held a very long charge for about six months. It can be used twice to charge an Android phone but then needs its own charge. If not used at all, ends up completely drained after a couple days. Charging cable has also broken. Can't find/see where to contact seller (might be completely over looking how to contact) since product is still under 18 month warranty (end Feb 8th).",0
5.0,,"July 3, 2018",Yes,"The Anker battery pack has been a rock - well, not literally (i.e. not a brick - but more like a solid supporting rock-of-Gibralter kinds...)...it retains charge even after a few days of storage and then provides at least 2-3 full charges to your phone before it will need recharging itself...please remember it takes a while to full charge so if traveling etc charge it at night so you have it ready for the next day. A solid, reliable product - and, I,  as someone  who has been traveling a lot this summer, can testify it has kept my phone up and running time and again! Recommended!",0
5.0,,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"Incredible battery life, super slim and sturdy, and very affordable. One con though: takes 10 hours to be fully charged. 10 HOURS! If only they updated all their models to have the new USB port that supports lightning charges--instead of having that function on a few bulky models. However, I never leave home without this. Also, it comes in a nice drawstring mesh bag and minimal packaging, which only shows just how considerate the company is!",1
5.0,,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"First of all, this is a wonderful product and next when I say about Anker customer service it is simply outstanding. After my purchase I had a problem with my received product. Then the customer service contacted me and asked for the issue. Sharon, from the customer service exceeded my expectations and they solved the issue within a week by replacing my faulty one. I generally don't write any reviews but for this I must write to let the fellow customers know about their wonderful service. Thank you Anker and Amazon. Highly recommended. Don't even think twice to buy it and just go for it. I'm sure you will not regret it.",2
5.0,,"April 6, 2017",Yes,"I never bought any of these battery packs..But i was heading to a place - middle of amazon jungle with no electricity, nothing - so i thought i better get something..And im so glad!.For 12 days my Galaxy note 4 was working fine! i did put it on battery save mode - but when it was getting too low, i would just charge it!.and it charged my phone 100% i think 4 times, though not all were from 5%..But it was a saver, small, easy to use! Very handy when u're traveling!!",1
5.0,,"December 31, 2016",Yes,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: It's a convenient size and charges my phone at a good rate but doesn't have as many charges as one would hope.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 and it definitely covers 2 charges but I wouldn't say a complete 3. I haven't had it long but it feels like it's already losing it's charging power.  UPDATE: Anker's customer service is absolutely amazing.  After I posted about being unsatisfied by the amount of charges I was receiving from my PowerCore, they contacted me and went above and beyond to resolve the issue.  The PowerCore 10000 is only expected to charge a Samsung Galaxy S5 phone between 2.12 to 2.5 times.  The only downside is that it takes a while to charge the PowerCore itself.",0
5.0,,"July 24, 2018",Yes,"ANKER, you guys owe me money.  Around 2015,16 I scoured the market.  Out of 6 others I boiled it down to this obscure product and it's been my goto gift ever since.  I always referred friends in my network and everyone loved it so much, it has become our goto referral for charger batteries.  I come back a few years later, its an amazons choice best seller....and rightfully, deservedly so. You're welcomed!  cut the check  ;0)..I'm here to purchase my second one because I lost mine in a cab...unfortunately.  great product!",0
5.0,,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"I bought 2 of these Battery Chargers for my daughters back in June 2017. They love them! It is now 8 months later, and they are still in perfect condition! About a month ago one of daughters had an issue where her Battery Charger wasn't holding it's charge. I contacted Anker Customer Service, and they were such a big help! Here, it was my daughter's USB Cable that was no longer working. She got rid of the bad USB cable, replaced it, and voila! the Battery Charge was working again! Will definitely purchase more Anker products in the future!",0
5.0,,"June 26, 2017",Yes,"I bought the Anker portable charger back in March because I was going to a concert in late April &amp; needed a portable charger for my iPhone. I'd been searching online for one for some time because I wanted to buy a reliable charger yet inexpensive. This Anker portable charger definitely did the trick, it works great &amp; doesn't take long to charge. It fully charges my iPhone (and can do so about 3-4 times before it runs out of charge). It isn't super heavy and even comes with a little bag for you to place the charger in when you carry it around. As expected, my phone ran out of charge at the concert and I easily brought out the charger and plugged it into my phone. It wasn't a hassle to carry while recording/taking pics during the concert due to its compact size. I'd definitely recommend this product &amp; would buy it again myself.",1
5.0,,"April 1, 2019",Yes,"This charger is exactly what you're looking for. The battery is amazing and charges my iPhone 8 up to 4 times before it runs out.  It's not the type of charger that will break after a month either, and it's practically indestructible (I've dropped it a thousand times).  It takes a while to fill up, so just charge it overnight and no problems. The little mesh bag it comes in is perfect to hold the charger, a phone wire, and the charging wire and just throw it in your bag. For the amount of power this charger holds, it is impressively small (maybe about the size of a deck of cards).  Totally worth the $40 and I will probably stick to purchasing this charger in the future when mine inevitably gets too old.",0
4.0,,"June 6, 2018",Yes,It has been a month since I bought it. I have only used it three times so far and already the power bank is not working properly. I am unable to charge the power bank fully. No matter how long I charge it doesn't go beyond two bars. So I have to charge it often and it drains very quickly...I want to update my review..I had a bad experience with the first one but the second one works great. Just as expected. It's light it's small great to carry it around when u are walking. Charges like expected. Thank you for taking my review seriously and reaching out. Customer service was amazing.,0
5.0,,"September 8, 2017",Yes,"At my first review I wasn't happy with this product. In less than 15 minutes after posting my first review, I received an email from the customer service trying to solve my problem. Because the issue persisted they sent me a new one:) I am extremely happy with the new one. The size is perfect, with the fully charged Anker I can charge my phone about 5 to 6 times which is awesome. I am extremely appreciated first for the great customer service and second for the product. I wish you guys the best of luck.",3
5.0,,"August 21, 2017",Yes,"Took 13 hours to fully charge, which I guess is normal if you're not using a rapid charger. Once fully charged it works great. I've fully charged my iPhone twice and my grandson used it to chrage his vape thingy and the Anker PowerCore is still not out of juice. My car died when my phone battery was very low, and I was able to plug in the Anker PowerCore and then use my iPhone to communicate with my insurance co and emergency car service people without worrying my phone would die.",1
5.0,,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"I have other Anker products so this one met my expectations. A fun gag- My cousin has one of their blue tooth Speakers with the logo ""ANKER"" prominently displayed on the front. Before I left on my last trip to visit him and his family, I added a ""W"" to the front with a black Sharpie- we do gags like that and he had lived in England so it was even funnier. Try it out on your close mate!",1
5.0,,"September 13, 2018",Yes,"***UPDATE***..09/23/18: Shortly after writing my review I was contacted by Anker Customer Service. They have apologized and offered to send me a new unit without me having to ship back defective one. New one works as described and I love it. Very kind and super responsive customer service as well! From 1 to 5 stars!..Purchased this small external battery few days ago. It worked well the first day, and the next i've recharged it and worked well again. But that's it. Now I can not recharge PowerCore no matter what I do. I have tried different cables and adapters, different outlets, but the result is still the same. It doesn't work. I am hugely disappointed!",1
5.0,,"March 10, 2018",Yes,I ordered a charger that seemed to stop working after only two months. ButI got in touch with the vendor and they confirmed it was defective. They promptly sent me a replacement and I've been all set! I've used Anker products in the past and been very happy with the chargers. This is a great way to ensure that your phone still works while you're away from a wall charger. It's lightweight and quickly recharges my phone a few times before it needs to sit for a recharge. Glad to know that they care so much about their customers!,0
4.0,,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"The battery is of very good quality and can charge my iphone 6s plus very quickly. It's also pretty cool that it is light and small, making it easy when out of the house...My one problem would have to be not knowing the exact battery %. When I have it charging my phone, the lights will show full battery(all 4 lights lit) but if I take it and put it to charge, it shows 3 lights lit and one blinking. It would be nice to know the battery % so I can know if it is at  80% as that difference can mean  approx. 1 full battery charge.",0
5.0,,"December 30, 2018",Yes,"The units smart charge tech allowed it to high speed charge my device from 24% to 100% in less than 30 minutes. I hike a lot and couple this with a simple compact 10 watt portable solar cell to field charge on the go or at bivi. Fully charged, this device has recharged my GPS/phone 3 times without trouble as described. I'll note that i observed some power depletion on the trail after exposing it to temps ranging from 18°F / 30°F (-7°C  / -1°C) for 30hrs.  On my next trip with similar temps, I re-positioned the unit in my pack to an area closer to my back allowing it to take advantage of my core temp and voila, no more loss due to lower temps (if u hike, u know exactly what im talking about :D). You could carry in your pocket. I'm just not comfortable doing so. ewer models are available, but I'd recommend this unit to anyone looking for an inexpensive lightweight portable power cell that you don't have to worry about using or losing on the trail. Hope this helped one of you out there.",0
5.0,,"May 4, 2018",Yes,"Just finished a 3 day bike packing ride and took two Anker Power Cores with me, I was able to keep my phone and Bluetooth speaker charged for the entire trip with one charger almost depleted and the other with three quarters of a charge left. I forgot my charge cord for my GPS but I have no doubt these chargers would have kept it topped off as well. Very satisfied with Anker products and will be ordering one more power core and an Anker foldable solar charger for my Arizona Trail ride later this year.",0
5.0,,"May 31, 2017",Yes,I can charge this battery pack and it will hold the full charge for weeks. I love to take this camping. I can get at least half a dozen charges out of it. It charges my phone and ipad very quickly. It is also light weight so it's great for backpacking if your concerned about carrying to much weight..My wife also has one she carries in her purse she claims she left it in here purse for two months and it still had 75% battery left in it.,1
5.0,,"January 31, 2018",Yes,"I bought this unit about 9 months ago and have been thrilled with its quick charge performance.  This review is not about the product as much as their customer service.  I admit that I may have dropped the unit on more than one occasion, which could have compromised the product.  I emailed customer service telling them that i could not charge the unit and they immediately responded, made a couple of suggestions; trying a different wall charger or a different power cord.  I had tried both and informed them of such.  They responded the next day stating that they would honor their 18 month warranty and sent another replacement unit to me that day.  It arrived 2 days later...Here's a company that has a great product, exceeded by their customer service.  Impossible to go wrong with this product or company.  Highly recommended!!",0
1.0,,"April 12, 2019",Yes,Bought this for my mom for Xmas.  She just recently tried charging her iPhone and it will not charge the phone.  I’ve tried with different cords and with my phone as well.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND!,1

If someone asks me about a portable charger, this is the one I direct them to buy...You can charge and iPhone X from start to finish three plus times in full with this charger before you need to charge it. It is compact, durable, and just a fantastic overall device. The device comes with the charger itself, a mesh bag to carry/store it in, and a cord to charge the device. You will not be disappointed with this product.",0
5.0,,"March 27, 2018",Yes,"This is great! It's compact and easy to carry in a jacket pocket or laptop bag, and it holds a charge for weeks until I need it. It's also good for several phone-charging sessions, unlike some of the lower-capacity batteries. My only complaint is that it's considerably heavier than the lower-capacity batteries, but hey, that makes sense! I've always got this with me, with both iPhone and Android cables connected at the same time, and it's nice that I can offer a charge to friends even when I don't need one.",0

Thankfully, I have those already.",0
5.0,,"July 31, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this for traveling, but have been using it around home, too.  After a morning of reading on the porch, the 'pad sometimes has a puny charge.  Rather than abandon my book, I've been plugging the 'pad into this PowerCore.  It more than fully charges the 'pad, and does it relatively quickly.  It's portable, so I can leave my device plugged in in my bag, if I need to.  Doesn't take too long to charge from an electricity source, either.",1
5.0,,"December 5, 2017",Yes,Purchased for my Disney Vacation. This was a lifesaver at the parks! I was able to charge my phone several time before the battery pack needed to be recharged. I was a little worried because I have an older Samsung (s4) but it worked great! I was able to get one full charge on my i-pad mini with this. I would recommended for anyone traveling or if you don't want to be chained to an outlet while charging your phone!,1
5.0,,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"After 6 months I began having problems using this battery, which was really frustrating. However, Anker replaced it, and I had the same problems. Bad news, right?..Well, I bought a different brand of battery, and I'm still having problems charging my phone with any of these portable batteries. On occasion, they work. On other occasions, they don't...So, now I'm beginning to think that the problem is with my 3-year old iPhone 6S and not these batteries.",1
5.0,,"December 18, 2017",Yes,"Anker batteries are awesome.  Took this with me on a trip to the Smokey Mountains and I killed it in about a week, during which I kept the following charged:.2 Nexus 6ps (partial charges).1 Fitbit Charge 2.1 GoPro Hero 4..It was pretty dead after that, but it did exactly what I needed it too.  Goes in the everyday carry backpack now for emergencies.",1
5.0,,"December 4, 2017",Yes,"This is a fantastic backup battery. I got this for a trip to Italy, and it was well worth the purchase price. I used my phone a ton to take pictures and find directions. There's no way I would have made it through the day without the spare charge in this battery. It's about the size of a deck of cards and fits comfortably in your pocket. Very easy to carry around, and worth it for the extra power it provides...I bought a second one for my wife, who kept bugging me to use it when we would spend all day away from power while watching and racing in regattas. The second one lasted a few weeks, then inexplicably stopped working. I contacted Anker customer service, who very promptly and politely responded to my requests. A replacement battery arrived in a few days and works wonderfully.",1
5.0,,"May 6, 2017",Yes,I had 1 of these already and bought a second for my son.  It holds it charge for months.  It will charge my LGV10 cell phone 3+ times with a full charge.  It is a good amount of charge for weight of brick.  I will be taking this on my trip on the AT along with the Anker 15w dual solar charger.  I feel it will be more than enough power for the trip,2
5.0,,"April 2, 2019",Yes,"I love this charger!  I have the larger, heavier Anker (not sure of the mAh's) to take when we travel. But I.needed one for work as I am frequently out visiting policyholders. This is perfect, not.too heavy and it keeps a charge.

4.0,,"October 30, 2016",Yes,"It's everything it is advertised. Small, lightweight and packed with enough power to charge several of my devices... some more than twice over. The only qualm I may have against it is that it doesn't come with it's own charger. I tried using my old  OEM iPod touch charger to charge it initially and it got really hot within minutes. I quickly switch over to my Samsung Tab charger and while it didn't overheat, it luckily stayed only warm during rest of it's duration while it was charging. There should be a warning on what on types of charger can be safely used with the device. Still, other than that one issue, it's a solid buy!",1
5.0,,"April 14, 2019",Yes,"I got this little charger because it is small, yet able to charge a phone several times before it needs to be plugged in again. I found that it charged my phone from nearly 0% to 100% in about 1.5 hours, which I think is great. Following this, I also charged a tablet from about 40% to 100%. That just about exhausted what this charger had, but I think that is fine for its size.",0
5.0,,"July 11, 2017",Yes,Got this as a gift for my wife before we went overseas for 2 weeks.  She was able to charge her phone during the day for 4-5 days before it needing to be recharged.  I was actually very impressed with it.,3

Even sometimes when you press the button to see the percent charged, it will make this fizzing sound. The battery seems to work fine, but the sound it makes is alarming, making me nervous to leave it plugged into the wall if I am not around. I spoke with a friend who also has an Anker, but he has no problems with this sound I am experiencing.

We travel almost weekly to watch grandkids play in tournaments even out of state using the phone for hours at a time for directions to the different city parks which will drain the phone's power-cell and Anker's PowerCore 10000 is a life saver when we get to the games with no power source in sight. These portable chargers are a must when traveling especially when you run into car trouble. Nice compact size, great power, and a great charger.",1
4.0,,"April 14, 2018",Yes,"...to paraphrase a famous man, it depends on what the meaning of ""smallest"" is.  The marketing photo of the Anker atop a credit card is crafted like a politician's press release or a TV news reader's prepared script (I'm charitably pretending there's a difference between the two).  Yes, it's all absolutely true except for the parts left out...I've attached a pic of the battery next to a stack of 15 (really, 15) credit/etc. cards.  I ran out of plastic before I could make the card stack as thick as the Anker.  That's not to say that this Anker isn't a fine piece of work - I own and have owned several of their branded products over time, am very satisfied and expect I'll be happy with this item too.  It replaces a much slimmer equivalent that eventually wore out.  But this thing isn't appreciably smaller, it's about the same with the fatness moved around.",5
3.0,,"October 19, 2018",Yes,First off Anker makes quality products which is why I keep buying their stuff but it also means I hold them to a higher standard. Just as portable charger this is 5 stars...works great for that but I'm really kinda annoyed that it can't pass thru charge. Why can't the PowerCore charge itself and charge my phone at the same time. I just feel like this isn't a hard feature to add and other portable power supplies do it. Be a great feature as a mini UPS for like a Raspberry Pi or similar...You're better than this Anker.,0
5.0,,"October 7, 2016",Yes,"I purchased this portable charger to replace an older one that seemed to have terribly lost its charge.  I was very surprised at the features packed into the low price so I went ahead and ordered... Wow!  The first thing you'll notice is that this thing is smaller than you thought it was!  It is so light and small that I could fit it into one of my jean pockets if I wanted to...It charged my iPhone 7 Plus very quickly, feels good in the hand, has awesome packaging, recharges itself in only 3-4 hours, and is very portable.  I can easily see myself purchasing a few of these for my family.  Great product Anker!  Can't wait to try out something in the 20,000mAh range since I'm a worry-er!",0
4.0,,"November 11, 2017",Yes,My husband has one of these and when I wanted one he insisted this brand. It’s definitely worth it. I got 3 full iPhone charges per charge plus several headphones and it doesn’t seem to lose a charge if you let it sit. Only reason it’s 4 and not 5 stars- the cord that comes with it is about 6 inches long which makes it hard to plug into a charger,1
5.0,,"May 28, 2018",Yes,Excellent portable battery. I bought it over two years ago and it's still running strong. Most do not. I know because I have bought other brands to my chagrine. Anker is a reputable company amongst the alternative brands and for good reason. This battery is pretty small too so it's great for traveling and for your work bag. I'd highly recommend this. What's interesting is that the cost of this battery went up to $29.99 whereas I bought it two years ago for $21.99.,0
4.0,,"August 11, 2018",Yes,"(August 2018) After a month or so of using the battery, it took about 24 hours to charge....(New post Sept. 4, 2018).ANKER got in touch with me and sent a New battery right away. So far it has been working very good!!! No complaints and hopping to change the rating to 5 stars in a few weeks..Great customer service!",2
5.0,,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"We love this! I purchased this for my a Christmas present for my husband. He told me it was one of the best gifts ever. It works amazing and he uses his phone constantly for work. (He is an iOS developer) it fits into his pocket easily, so he can take it with him. He has had zero complaints or complications. I also think it is a great price for the quality. We love this company (Anker) and have purchased other things from them which have all been well made and quality products. One time I had a cord stop working and they replaced it quickly and no hassle. GREAT COMPANY! We will be purchasing another for me.",0
5.0,,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"I love this brand of battery pack. I purchased this external battery over a year ago and it recently stopped working out of nowhere. I was worried I was out of a external battery and was going to have to buy a new one, but I looked on the Anker website and this item is under warranty for 18 months! I was able to get a refurbished battery for no additional charge. This refurbished battery pack works perfectly and I am so happy with this product. I even bought my entire family one because it is so useful. I can typically get over 3 full charges on my iPhone with this pack. 100% would recommend!",1
4.0,,"August 29, 2017",Yes,"This Power Core has only been used a couple of times.  It now doesn't work.  It shows it is fully charged, but now DRAINS my phone battery.  I check the battery percentage of my phone.  Leave it plugged into the Power Core, come back and the percentage is LOWER...UPDATE: Anker sent me a new one and it works as expected.  Good customer service as well.",2
5.0,,"December 3, 2017",Yes,Bought this for my daughter as she seems to constantly need a charge for her phone.  Since the purchase she has had no complaints and says it works great to keep her phone powered up while she's on the go.  It does take quite some time to charge fully once it's drained but I suppose that is expected for the amount of juice it holds.,1
5.0,,"November 27, 2016",Yes,"As I've purchased before, I use this battery pack constantly if it's not for my phone it's to help a friend get some electrical juice so he can take a Lyft home at 2:00 am from a long night out. It's helped on the nights of being out in the middle of nowhere and you don't need to rely on the electrical grid...Sleek design but has a really nice weight to it like it ""feels"" like a well-made product but few quirks about it I'm not the biggest fan of. I'll start with me not being able to charge it while plugging my phone into it to charge the phone. It probably has some form of battery memory that the receiving a charge while giving a charge is a great way to make it explode so if that's not possible, I'll take my losses...Maybe add some grit to the case design so it doesn't slip out of your hands like a wet noodle...I digress, consumers that are looking to pick up a battery pack, look no further when it comes to quality and durability. The hinge on the plug prongs has a satisfying snap that it is built to last and charges many a device. Plus it's as big as a credit card, well slightly bigger. :)..tl:dr; Charges most devices with issue, charge for battery lasts a long time. 5/5 would buy more.",1
5.0,,"May 21, 2017",Yes,"First of all, I charged this thing and didn't use it for a month. I'm on my first cycle and so far it's charged my galaxy s6 3 times and still has juice. The size is perfect, because I can't carry it with me and charge my phone while working without having to find somewhere to leave it. I keep it in my pocket and it doesn't over heat. Super happy with this thing. It also seemingly charges faster than my wall charger, but I might just be imagining that part. If you need a compact charger, for a SINGLE device...this is ur guy. Been hearing a lot about Anker. You can tell the quality of the packaging and device itself is great. Looking forward to trying out some of their other stuff!..Sincerely,.RJM",7
5.0,,"September 19, 2016",Yes,This charger is excellent! It's compact and lightweight which is exactly what I was looking for on my last backpacking trip through Utah. It doesn't weigh down my pack and is able to charge my iPhone multiple times along with anything else that needs to be recharged. The capacity is more than enough for a day trip or even a night or two if you aren't constantly draining your devices. It's small enough you can throw it in a backpack or your pocket and bring it to school or around town. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice capacity charger that's in a lightweight compact form factor.,2
5.0,,"December 16, 2018",Yes,"I bought one for myself and it was so good I bought another one for my dad. We both travel a lot so we were running out of battery on our phone easily and were constantly looking for outlets to re-charge... good bye to those days! I not only recharge my phone but also lend the battery to other passengers. The battery is light weighted, not big at all and can recharge my phone many times.",0
5.0,,"November 24, 2017",Yes,I researched a lot of these before I pulled the trigger on this one and I'm glad I did. This thing is amazing. I'm at four full charges on my Droid Ultra and I still have half the charging capacity left on the batteries. This is great for camping and hiking and the size is perfect. This charges my phone faster than my wall unit. Great product!,1
5.0,,"September 23, 2018",Yes,I bought this for hurricane season but finally decided I'd better test it out during the initial 30-day period to make sure it worked rather than waiting for the power to go out.  I have just charged my iPhone 5S for a second time on the same battery pack and it's still reading that it has four bars of power.  And the phone charged quickly.  I'll charge my Kindle next to make sure it also works with that.,0
5.0,,"November 27, 2016",Yes,"I love this charger!  I looked at several brands and many, many reviews before deciding which charger to buy.  I settled on this Anker unit because people seemed to like it.  I now see why.  I have had this for about six months and it has been helpful through power outages, one that lasted for two days.  I can re-charge my cell phone four complete times on a single charge.  I never have to worry about my phone battery running low late in the afternoon while I am away from a location where I can charge it.  I just plug the Anker PowerCore into my phone and it recharges it quickly.  I recommend this without hesitation and just bought a second one for a friend of mine.",0
3.0,,"August 6, 2017",Yes,"Device is temperamental regarding when it decides to charge from the wall as well as when it decides to discharge into a cellular device.  I have had good luck with other Anker products, but this one just misses the mark.  I did give it a few stars as it does work some of the time but I wouldn't rely on it for situations where you might NEED to keep a cellular device charged for emergency calls in rural areas.",1
5.0,,"July 8, 2016",Yes,"This battery has been a life saver for me.  I usually get a half dozen charges (from 1/2 drained) on my Samsung Note 4.  Now I don't have to go looking for an outlet!  I charge the battery about once a week... plug it in (along with my phone) when I go to bed.  I don't really know how long it takes to charge the battery but, it's always fully charged when I wake up.  Did I mention that it is small!... about the size of a bar of soap.  I use this battery with the ""MediaBug Short Durable Silicone Charge &amp; Sync Micro-USB Cable for Android Smartphones"" (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LVDW9OA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s03?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). All this fits in my pocket!",0
5.0,,"September 27, 2018",Yes,I like this power bank because it is able to charge my phone multiple times which is very important to me as I am an avid Disney-goer and I need my phone at all times while in the parks! It helps me last throughout the entire day and even for several more days! Very easy to recharge with the included cord and the best part is that it comes with a little protective pouch so you don't have to worry about small scratches when you need to quickly throw it into your backpack or purse. Would highly recommend!,1
5.0,,"May 16, 2018",Yes,"Worked great for about 2 months of light use (10 phone charges per month)  then it sat in the drawer idle for 6 months.  Now it randomly stops charging the connected device.  Device/Cord changes dont seem to matter, it just stops charging randomly...****Update - Anker's Customer service reached out to me and offered a replacement unit.  I received it and have been using it heavily for the last 10 days.  Product performs exactly as expected.  Customer service was great.  for a small compact battery charger I would recommend this.  Im getting 3-4 full charges on my Samsung mobile phone.",0
5.0,,"July 31, 2018",Yes,"This is my 3rd time purchasing this product. I've had multiple family members see and want one for themselves. My Android phone charges immediately after connecting to the power bank, though I've seen iPhones that require you to press the button in order to start charging. This has consistently been the case, but that has not impacted me as an Android user...The form factor makes it really convenient to carry around for me. It's heavier than I would've preferred, but you're gonna have to carry this weight if you want the capacity...Overall, a great product.",1
5.0,,"August 7, 2017",Yes,"Initial charge took about 8 hours now it takes about 3-5 hours to fully charge. It charges my Galaxy S6 about 3 times before needing charged again. My phone will be under 20% and it charges fully in less than an hour, quicker than plugging it in an outlet! I went on a 9 hour hike and it kept my phone powered up the whole time. Compact and not too heavy, a must have for travel!",1
5.0,,"January 5, 2017",Yes,"I love this battery. For the price I don't think it can be beat. I purchased it to use at a camping music festival, where I knew there would not be many opportunities to charge my phone or recharge the battery. This battery lasts about 4-5 full charges, which was enough to get me through the 3 days and 2 nights I was there...I am a music blogger and I attend lots of concerts, always taking lots of photos and videos, and posting on Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat throughout the show. This drains my iPhone's battery extremely fast. I like to keep this in my pocket, and charge my phone with it throughout the show, especially between bands. Gone are the days of needing to hunt down an outlet and babysit my phone while attached to a wall...I have had issues with batteries in the past losing power very quickly after a few uses or not living up to expectations, but this one has performed perfectly for the last 2 months I have had it...It comes with a charging cable and a little carrying case pouch, which is nice, but I never use since it is pretty rugged on its own.",1
5.0,,"September 10, 2017",Yes,"This powerful little charger delivers!  My little girl plugs her Iphone into it anytime we are away from an electrical outlet, and charges her phone. We are very happy with this Anker PowerCore 10000, it pushes those electrons in, and gives a strong charge just like a 120 volt plug.  Good unit, charges right back up when depleted, it just works, and we are pleased!",1
4.0,,"October 5, 2018",Yes,"This sturdy little external battery charger is a lifesaver -- especially when you have an older battery.  Even with a new battery, I feel secure when I have this at events.  I LOVE it.. because it long lasting and because it fits into a pocket or purse.  What I am not happy about is that there is no cord for the phone and this battery charger with the product, and this was misleading",0
1.0,,"May 12, 2017",Yes,What a disappointment fully charge plugged in my device charged for 5 seconds then stop working.,5
5.0,,"March 23, 2017",Yes,"Huge power in a small package. This works perfectly and has enough charge to fill up all of my devices. There are four LEDs that show how full the bank with just a press of the button. I was surprised to find that along with the bank, I also get a nice Anker branded mesh bag and a short cord making this the full package for your charging needs!",3
5.0,,"June 24, 2018",Yes,This thing works like a champ! I've used both an iPhone 8 plus and a Samsung S7 on this and it charges both so fast. It's compact compared to my first ever Anker portable charger and the bright color let's me easily find it in my bag. I charge it overnight and am ready to go for the day. I brought it on my Atlanta trip and my colleagues were all asking to borrow it once they found out I had it lol,0
5.0,,"March 27, 2017",Yes,"Reasonably compact-I can fit both phone and charger in my back pocket. Got 3.5 charges for my Samsung mini 4 before the battery was depleted..UPDATE - After 9 months of daily use my Power Core stopped working - endlessly blinking light and it would not charge my phone. I went to the ANKER help site and submitted a request for a replacement, detailing the issue (I was surprised to relearn the device comes with an 18 month warranty). The next day, a Monday, I received a very polite and personal email apologizing for the one that slipped by their rigorous QC, verifying the address to which they should ship the replacement, and further inquiring if the other one bought at the same time (for my husband) was still functioning properly (it is). As I had provided a serial number in my original request they did not need me to return the defective unit and my replacement arrived Thursday of the same week. I can't recall ever having such a satisfying resolution to a consumer complaint. I was telling my brother about the experience and he orderd a battery from them on the spot. I will use ANKER products from now on.",1
1.0,,"January 31, 2018",Yes,"Didn't work for us... it wouldn't take a charge.  It came already charged, and worked fine until we had to recharge it.  Had to return it.",4
4.0,,"May 3, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this to use to charge my phone on-the-go, and it has worked great for the past month. However, this week it has stopped retaining charge completely. I left it charging for over 5 hours this morning and it still only has one measly light blinking when I checked the charge on it afterwards. I have tried two different cables, two different usb adapters, and several different outlets in my house to try to charge it but it is no longer charging/retaining charge. I have only had this thing for a month. Would be great if I could get any response from Anker or Amazon on this as I'm sure this is not a usual case..UPDATE 1 - 5/11/2017:.Bumping my rating up due to good customer service from Anker. Anker has sent me a replacement as it seems the product that I received was indeed defective. I've had the replacement for almost a week now and it has been working as expected. Hopefully it stays this way",1
5.0,,"February 4, 2019",Yes,I like my charger still but it only works when I put the charger in a certain way. Used to just work when i turned on the power button.

Thank you so much!! Best customer service ever.,0
5.0,,"September 15, 2018",Yes,"The best battery pack I have ever used..Fast: it charges faster than some official iphone chargers (IQ thingy).Size: nearly half the size of an iphone 7plus (can fit in your pocket).Indicator that is good enough to give you an idea about its current capacity.Durable: dropped it several times and it is still working, use it on daily bases as i prefer to charge it and then change my phone from it.Reliable: 1 year later, it can still give more than 2 charges for an iphone 7plus.",0
5.0,,"March 16, 2018",Yes,"I bought this charger a few weeks ago, and leave it in my backpack in case of my phone running out of power. It gets a full charge in about 45 minutes to an hour, and charges my iPhone 6s from 0-100 in about an hour, but I don’t usually do that, instead just plugging my phone in when it is about 20% and leaving it on for a half hour. I can usually get 2-3 charges on my phone when the power bank is fully charged...The product is noticeably heavier than my phone, but not to a bothersome point. It is 2/3 as long as my phone and about as wide as it...In summary, this is a good product, and I would recommend it for someone who needs a lightweight charger to carry around with them for the day.",1
5.0,,"September 24, 2017",Yes,This is a life saver for being on the go with my iPhone !  Charges up and then take it with and you can get three good charges out of it before having to charge it again !!! Customer service is very kind and helpful ! Great product and great company 😊😊😊,2

The battery lasts long as well, i charged it like 2 weeks ago before i left out of town but didn’t actually use it &amp; havent used it ever since, but using it today it still has a full charge from 2 weeks ago and it charges my iphone 8 really fast. 5 star!",1
5.0,,"November 19, 2017",Yes,"Don’t know how I traveled so much without these before!! With the Apple conspiracy of making your iPhone battery die faster when they release a new version, this battery pack worked great. No more stress as I watch my phone battery die while I’m walking around the airport or in the plane. No more having to look for a power plug at the airport. I took this on a trip and charged all my friends’ phones during the day as we were out and about. Small enough to fit in my cross body purse along with my phone. I bought the case to go with it as well a 6” cord to charge my phone.",0
5.0,,"April 13, 2018",Yes,"Read my first review of this product, below. Very soon after posting my review, Anker sent me an email message saying that it would send me a new battery free of charge.  The new battery arrived within a few days and works perfectly.

4.0,,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"Love the convenience of it...I can throw in my purse and quickly  Charge my phone. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the power button on the side doesn't seem to work. The good thing is: as soon as you unplug your phone the charger turns itself off, so it won't run down the battery. I have an Android Jv3 &amp; it appears i can get up to 3 full charges before it needs to be recharged.",0
4.0,,"April 5, 2018",Yes,"I really like this charger. It charges my iphone several times over, but when it gets low and I charge it, it takes a very long time to charge. It charged in about 10 hours. I don't know if its faulty or if I let it lose too much of its power, but it seems like it shouldn't take that long...Edit: Anker reached out to me and assessed the problem, stating the charge time should be 6-7 hours and that I potentially had a faulty battery. They are sending me a replacement. Great customer service!",0
4.0,,"July 28, 2017",Yes,"Bought as a source for phone battery juice when away from outlets for extended periods. Charges up quite fast, but can get the wall plug and USB cable quite hot from the current draw. Charges phone up fairly quickly as well, though not as fast as a quick charger.

5.0,,"July 5, 2016",Yes,"This is my second purchase from Anker and I am completely satisfied with the purchase. I previously bought the first generation lipstick sized portable charger and it came in handy during a couple situations but the charge capacity wasn't near where I wanted it to be. I kept it for a couple years until I decided to purchase another portable charger. At this point I had upgraded to the S6 edge and wanted a portable charger with fast charging and a charger that'll last a couple charges. I came back to Ankers Amazon page and after I little research I found this gem for the same price I bought the lipstick sized charger with a fraction of the battery capacity. I then ordered it, got it, and haven't been disappointed since. There have been times where I completely forgot to take it out my car to charge but it still had ~75% left after a charge or so. Even though it doesn't have fast charging, it's noticeably faster than the regular cable charging that you would have with standard charging through the wall (without the fast charging adapter.) And the power indicator lights are so clutch to see how much charge is left on the charger. I've full charge could get me about 3 recharges. I haven't completely recharged my phone from a low percent so I'm not sure exactly how many you'll get out of it Galaxy S6/Edge owners but I'm sure it's enough for you to fill up and make it home after a long day. I would definitely recommend this product.",1

5.0,,"February 5, 2019",Yes,"I bought four of these for my family for stocking stuffers at Xmas. Everyone was polite but unexcited, but it has been their most used Xmas gift EVER. They charge everything from e-cigarettes to tablets quickly and with minimal hassle and are so portable. They themselves recharge relatively quickly as well. I need to get another one for myself.",0
4.0,,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"This thing does exactly what it says, it allows you to charge your cell phone when you are not near power.  Positives, small and light and it has four lights to display the charge level.  Negatives, only charges one device at a time, and does not come with a wall charger.  If it allowed charging two devices at once, and if it came with a wall charger, it would certainly deserve Five Stars.",0
5.0,,"September 4, 2018",Yes,"Bought one for camping. Total game changer. It charges up very quickly and can recharge my Samsung multiple times without needing charged itself. I also bought a folding solar charger from Ryno Tuff. Best two purchases I've ever made. I just purchased the Anker power core 13000 for a 3 day music festival. It charges two devices at once. For the extra few bucks, I'd recommend the newer 13000 but only because it holds more power and charges 2 devices at a time. This 10000 is just as dependable though!",1
1.0,,"June 27, 2018",Yes,"It says it supports E-phone, Samsung Galaxy and more.  I ordered it for my LG 6.  They should clarify what ""and more"" means.  I had to return and get one that supports my phone.  Sounds like it would have been an excellent product though.  In looking at the same item today.....I still do not see where they list exactly what it is compatible with.  ""And more"" is not good enough.",1
5.0,,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"This is the first battery I have purchased to extend the life of my iPhone, and I don’t know why I have waited so long! I was always running out of battery and looking for plugs. Now, I keep this in my purse, and it has been a lifesaver. I feel like this is one of those items that people buy and it works great at first, but then dies out. But I have waited to review and am very happy with the extended life. I have never had it run out on me, but it gives hours of extra time. It does not charge as fast as my phone, but it lasts way longer. It’s not super light, but it’s not cumbersome either. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another to keep in my car just in case!",0
5.0,,"June 13, 2018",Yes,Life savor! This little battery has saved quite the list of people from dead phones in so many occasions. My son's entire team has been able to charge there phone when they've gone on long trips to there meets. Battery life last about 3 days or so without having to be recharged. Haven't checked how many full cell batteries its been able to fill all at once with one full battery but I can say it last a lot.,0
5.0,,"August 1, 2018",Yes,"Unit used less than six times. Kept in my attache case for a backup solution. Worked well for 10 days past the return periodod one month. Received unit on June 22, 2018. Failed on August 1, 2018...Contacted manufacturer. Immediately they shipped a replacement at no charge and with understanding of problem and concerned more than I expected! No return hassle.  Replacement unit functioning exactly as expected. Completely satisfied with response!",1
4.0,,"June 28, 2017",Yes,"I have a Motorola Droid Turbo 2. This charges it 2.5 times. It takes around 2.5 hours per charge if you are not using your phone at the same time. Most efficient in Airplane mode. I like the light indicator on the side that lets you know how much charge is left. The device itself charges fairly quickly when I use my normal Droid wall plug charger. I have only used this for a week, but I like it.",1
5.0,,"February 22, 2019",Yes,I absolutely love this charger!! It picks up the charge quickly and can charge my phone from almost dead to 100%at least twice before it needs a charge and considering i have music on my phone all the time that's pretty darn good!! I would definitely recommend it and am getting a few more for my daughter and other family members,0
5.0,,"November 10, 2016",Yes,"I purchased this charger back in late August, because I'm going to be spending a lot of time in airports and planes this month, and I wanted to make sure I had enough time to try it out and see how it behaved. After about two and a half months of regular use, I'm glad to report that I am very happy with it. It's compact and light enough, and it holds almost four full charges for my iPhone 6...It does take a good long while to charge when plugged to a computer (slightly less if plugged directly to a wall outlet, and you need to get the plug), but it's a trade-off I'm very happy to make.",0
5.0,,"September 30, 2017",Yes,"iphone starts to heat up. using this to charge other gadgets instead..Update:  was contacted by seller, they sent me a new one. I use it with iphone 7 plus.  The new one is a lot better chargers my phone at least 2-3 times. Its small easy to carry.  You cant go wrong in buying as they have a good service behind their product.",1
5.0,,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"my wife loves it because it's small enough to add it to her purse without making it bulky, and it works very well (charges fast and provides good charge to her iPhone)",1
5.0,,"August 12, 2017",Yes,i originally bought this item in July 2017... loved it when I first received it as it charged both my iPhone 6 and my mini 4 iPad. In September 2017 the charger just didn't charge any longer so I went in and changed my rating from 5 Star to a 1 Star. At the time i didn't call Anker to try and get a refund since the item was $25.00...just figured it wasn't worth the trouble. After my change was posted I was notified by Customer Service at Anker asking if they could help and resolve the issue. I explained that the charger would no longer charge.. Customer Service was very cooperative and wanted to resolve the issue. They immediately sent another charger in its place and this one has worked perfectly. The charger charges both my iPhone 6 and iPad. I can get 4 charges from my iPhone when at 25% from a full charge and 2 plus charges with my iPad. I want to Thank Anker Customer Service for their effort to make this good and to let anyone else know if you have any issues with their product to contact them.😃,5
5.0,,"April 9, 2018",Yes,"This little gadget has been the best purchase I’ve made in a long time...Purchased for a trip that involved multiple airports and long batches of time between wall sockets, this battery pack came in a mesh drawstring bag and a charging cord for itself...Little did I know this would be the perfect item to use while enduring hospital stays, long doctors appointments and quick charges when a wall charge isn’t quick enough.",0
5.0,,"August 29, 2016",Yes,"This was my first time purchasing a portable battery.  I LOVE IT!!!!  I originally bought it for a trip to Disney World,  however I have found it to be convenient to carry it and use it regularly.  I love that it holds a charge for a long time.  I have gone weeks without needing it,  but still held a charge for me...It has four lights that shine when fully charged.  Each round of charging my phone uses up only 1 light.  So at the moment I have 2 lights left (charged phone  2 times already - recently).  The last time I charged it was 1st week of June.  I have a LG (E980). It takes about 1 hour to charge...Two things I don't like...it's kinda heavy and the net bag that comes with it doesn't stay closed and the cord keeps falling out.  BUT I STILL LOVE IT!",0
5.0,,"June 14, 2017",Yes,"Ordered this a few months ago and I can not express on how good this is! This can easily fit anywhere and is not bulky/ weak as other portables I've had in the past..Pros: This actually helps your phone battery last way longer because it automatically stops charging your device when the device is fully charged unlike a wall outlet that continuously charges..So small, can literally fit anywhere..Up to 4 charges on my iPhone 6..I ONLY charge my phone with this portable..Charges any device super quick.Cons: Takes a few hours to fully charge the portable..Overall, I would highly recommend this if you're always on the go and hate waiting around an outlet for your phone to charge. I told all my friends/ family to get this as well because it's a life saver not only for us but for the phones! Keep your device battery safe and get this Anker Portable!",1
1.0,,"November 5, 2017",Yes,Doesn't charge your phone fast. It's a very slow charger. I should have bought one of those cheaper one. The only reason I paid more because this one was listed as fast charger.,4
5.0,,"February 1, 2019",Yes,It will refill the battery life of 3 phones (or yours 3 times in the same day) and recharges quickly.  Use only the cord that came with it though because it works much better that way.  I was given one before buying this one that is a waste of time - and why I bought this one.  Very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.,0
5.0,,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"I originally ordered a unit around the same time last year. After using it for almost a year (constantly) it began to fail.  I was out of the return window for Amazon, so I contacted Anker directly.  They were more than happy to send me a Brand New one (after I told them the one I had failed). I love a company that stands 100% behind the products they sell, and will do what's right to make sure you remain a satisfied customer (using their products)...I would highly recommend their products and Anker (as a company) and their Excellent customer service.",0
5.0,,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"I love this thing.  I can charge my iPhone 6 like 4-5 times to full before having to recharge.  I paid $26 for this back in March and am so glad i did.  This is small enough to fit in my pocket but packs 10000 MAH!! If you are on the fence, buy this and keep it in your glovebox, backpack, purse, locker, etc.  Well worth the investment.",1
1.0,,"October 31, 2017",Yes,"Unbearably slow charging on my Galaxy S6.  takes 20 minutes to charge from 30% to 36% with phone sitting with screen turned off not being used.  5 minutes on a wall charger takes it from 44% to 52%.  So, 1.6% per minute on wall charger and .3% per minute on the Anker charger.",2
5.0,,"March 12, 2019",Yes,Bought this for a trip to Vegas. I have an IPhone X. Can get at least two full charges. The best advantage is being able to charge on the go. Sure you can bring a cord with you and find a usb almost anywhere now. It feels amazing not being tethered down. I can walk around the office with my phone instead of being on my desk.,0
5.0,,"December 19, 2018",Yes,"I love how compact this charger is - but still very powerful. I can get 2 full charges of my iPhone XS. It's super convenient for travel, especially when hiking or camping. Sure there are cheaper versions of external chargers out there, but the quality and durability of this product is worth the higher price point.",1
4.0,,"April 12, 2019",Yes,"I bought this product in August 2018 and have used it several times since then.  Recently it stopped working and I contacted Anker customer service since it was still under warranty.  I was expecting to have trouble getting help to get my product fixed or replaced.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised that I quickly got a response from customer service with a couple of suggestions that might fix my problem.  When this didn’t work, I was told that a replacement was on the way (didn’t even have to return my PowerCore)...The service I received on this replacement was exceptional.  I wish that all businesses provided this level of customer service!",0
5.0,,"April 18, 2019",Yes,"Using it every time when I travel somewhere and when I go for camping, snowboarding or any road trips. I dont use it every day, but it is must have thing that I bring with me. Had no problem using it to charge my Samsung Galaxy S8 and my iPhone 8 Plus. Anker is making great external batteries for charging your mobile devices!",0
5.0,,"January 28, 2019",Yes,"I order the Power Bank 100, but it quit charging after a couple of months of use. I contacted Anker support to see if they could help troubleshoot the issue. It was most likely an internal issue and they sent me another powerbank, which has been working perfectly. I must say that my communication with them has been the best customer service I have ever received. Everything from my initial phone call to the follow-up emails to see how I was doing with my new portable charger was amazing. I completely recommend Anker and their products. They really do go out of their way to help customers and it is amazing to work with a company that stands behind their products. Thank you Anker! This powerbank will go a long way as I continue on my Pokemon Go Adventure.",0
5.0,,"November 3, 2017",Yes,This is great for those of you that snap lots of pics on your cell phone when on vacations !! I felt free to snap away and not worry about my phone dying. It recharged fairly fast which is great when you're not near an electric outlet to charge your phone. I'll never leave on vacation without it again!,1
5.0,,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"I love this battery pack so much, I wish I had gone with the bigger option....However, don't underestimate this one. As it charges great and is pretty portable especially for girls..The only think I wish I had put more attention to is how many it can charge at once... It only has one USB outlet, which is fine for me.",1
5.0,,"June 27, 2018",Yes,"A year later review, for some reason the power brick has stopped charging. I tried different chargers and different bricks but the brick refuses to charge. 5 stars up until that happened. Overall, it worked like a charm for a year...I reached out to customer service and they helped me out tremendously. They apologized for the inconvenience.  The new one works well. Charges my galaxy s7 edge almost 3 times.",1
5.0,,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"I bought this product back in April 2017. It's the first power bank I've ever bought. It's now December 2018 and my Anker is still running great! I often use it when I am walking about town playing Pokemon GO, so it does charge my phone while I am using it. Can't attest to durability, because I am always careful with it, but it charges my Iphone 7 2-3 times over when my Iphone is almost completely dead. I also liked the charging cord and the small cloth bag that came with it. Tried it with my friend's phone (his phone has a bad battery) and it unfortunately didn't charge fast enough for him to play and charge at the same time. Other then that I haven't had any other issues with it and neither have my other friends. It's a great, small, portable power bank and would recommend!",0
5.0,,"December 21, 2016",Yes,"Have purchased power Banks before and have had no luck with them as the first one refused to charge after 2 months of use and the second one will shut itself off while charging my devices, as if it's not detecting that there is a device connected...Deciden to give Anker a chance to revive my faith in Power Banks...This Power Bank is indeed very small, I had to doublé check as I could not believe this was actually a 10000 mAh Power Bank. Included is a carri bag. Neat!..Impressed so far, let's see how it goes.",0
5.0,,"July 20, 2017",Yes,"Planning on taking this on a backpacking trip. Tested it out first to see how many charges my iPhone 6 can get. I was able to charge it 3 times from 1-10% battery life on the phone to 100%. This left approximately 20% on the PowerCore. I could have gotten another charge, but I didn't test that. Each time that I charged my phone, it took about 2-hours to get the full charge. Not too bad. It is about the same size and weight as my phone, which makes carrying it easy. For this price point, I would highly recommend it...Update: At the end of my backpacking trip, I was able to charge my iPhone 6 four time, my assistant's iPhone 6 one time, and a scout's iPhone one time. There was still more than 25% charge left. This was one of the major pieces of gear of the trip.",1
5.0,,"January 30, 2019",Yes,This is the third portable battery charger that I own from Anker. It is the BEST portable battery charger that I have ever used! My phone does not heat up and it's very quick. I love having the security of all my mobile electronics being easily recharged regardless of where I am.  The reserve capacity is incredible for the physical size of the unit and should run any current smart phone for a couple days off almost non stop high draw use.  This is a definite must have!,0
2.0,,"December 31, 2018",Yes,After two weeks of use will not fully charge even after charging overnight. Many other reviewers report the same problem which by definition means the battery is unreliable and should not be purchased,1
5.0,,"June 17, 2017",Yes,"Love the size and weight of this thing; it's kind of heavy and very comfortable in my hand.  Wish my phone was more that way.  I don't really time how long it takes to fully charge my phone; Android, I'm pretty easily pleased as long as it charges enough to be able to use it.  I am not really sure what to say about this, but it's good and it works for me.  Nice price also.",1
5.0,,"June 30, 2016",Yes,"I was really skeptical of most portable chargers and some people said this charger would become obsolete after a few charges. I bought two of these portable chargers for my wife and I to use and so far haven't had any issues. I have charged them multiple times and charged multiple devices in the last 4 weeks and haven't experienced one problem or issue. It takes about an hour in half to two hours to charge fully. It also depends on the depletion level. I charge it with the 24W dual usb wall charger powerport 2. If you're looking for a good, reliable charger then I don't see why you wouldn't buy this one...Giving an update on these chargers I bought in 2016. Its almost the end of 2018 and the they haven't slowed down at all. They still charge correctly, provide fast charging to my devices and have minimum damage (dropped them plenty of times and they still work). These chargers are awesome!!",24
5.0,,"April 24, 2017",Yes,"Awesome charger! Anker uses high-quality Panasonic 18650 lithium ion cells in these devices that should last a very long time (same cells that power the Tesla Model S). I love the finish on the device. It's also much lighter weight that other cheaper 10,000 mAh chargers. I highly recommend this charger as it's the nice sweet spot between capacity and weight.",1
5.0,,"December 21, 2016",Yes,"The third Anker external battery I bought, and very high quality.  The other two I own are very heavy, and not portable.  I bought this for a European trip for my wife to carry in her purse, as the others are too heavy, but this one does nicely.  You can get a couple of full iPhone charges from it, not as much as heavier batteries, but enough to keep you going in case you run out of battery or can't find a wall adapter (a common problem I've found in Europe).  Highly recommended for traveling.  Probably the best external battery brand out there.",0
5.0,,"April 2, 2019",Yes,This is my second Anker Battery pack bought for a relative.  The first one has been in use for almost a year and has not failed.  Well done Anker.,1
5.0,,"March 25, 2018",Yes,"Everyone needs one of these. No, seriously. I live in hurricane-prone South Florida and this little device gave me almost 3 full phone charges during the ""dark times"" of no electricity for 2 weeks. A very modest investment in continued connectivity to the world. Otherwise you're gonna be out in your car using it as a charging station. Completely reliable so far, in my experience.",0
5.0,,"July 19, 2017",Yes,"This is my second one as I gave my first one to my niece and I love, love, looooove this battery pack. It's small, compact and holds plenty of charge. I don't care for charging batteries fast so not complaint about the lack of QC charge port. It does what I need it to do when I need it to, plain and simple.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",1
5.0,,"September 9, 2018",Yes,"An absolutely incredible charger, I can sometimes go a week before I need to recharge it depending on how heavy I use it. Lightweight and portable which is perfect for my long commutes (and Pokemon Go adventures :P), and the pouch it comes in keeps it from heating up too much in my bag. Overall just an incredible product, and paired with Anker cables you can never go wrong.",0
5.0,,"December 30, 2016",Yes,"The Anker PowerCore 10,000 was a Christmas gift for my cousin. It's perfect to recharge his Kindle Fire or cell phone if he is where his cords and wall plugs are not available. This little charger packs a lot of power for being so small. I ordered one for my husband and myself. It's nice not worrying about running out of power or having to look for a wall plug when I'm in a waiting room situation. It comes with its own little case and connectors for iPhone and Kindle. Fits perfectly in my purse. This was a great find.",0
5.0,,"November 30, 2017",Yes,Love this product!  After being caught in hurricane Irma I decided I needed more battery backups.  I have an iPhone 7 and this battery will charge it so fast!  I let my phone get to 20% and can charge it 4 times before needing to charge the battery.  I have multiples just in case!,1
5.0,,"April 23, 2018",Yes,"Anker is awesome :)..This little battery is awesome...I needed one that was small. It fits nicely inside my stormtrooper helmet to power my fans to keep my lenses from fogging. Helps a bit with heat too! It's only powering two tiny fans, but I've only had to charge it the first time, and it still shows 4 full battery lights.....Happy customer!",0
5.0,,"January 1, 2017",Yes,"This battery is surprisingly cheap for its power! My phone charges from 1% to 100% in just one hour, and I can charge it again from 1-100% before the Anker charger depletes. I'm a heavy user (Bluetooth, music, YouTube, GPS, hotspot, and LTE), so it surprises me a lot that the battery charges the phone so quickly. The only disappointing feature is that I have to buy a separate cable if I want to use the battery with an iPhone, and there's only a micro USB cable included. Otherwise, this product is really impressive and I highly recommend it.",0
5.0,,"August 9, 2017",Yes,"One of the best cell batteries I have had. The Anker PowerCore now comes with me anytime I am going out of town. It has kept my Samsung Galaxy charged when I have been on many trips. I also like to use it when I'm at home, but in a place where plugging in a charger would be impractical. It can charge my phone 3-4 times before it needs to be recharged. It was a lifesaver at Disney world, allowing me to keep my nieces and nephew entertained while waiting in line. I have nothing but great things to say about Anker products.",0
5.0,,"May 25, 2018",Yes,"As a commuter to college, this product has honestly saved my life on a number of occasions. I am able to get multiple charges of my phone, headphones, and other technological equipment on one full charge...Design: It is small enough to fit in my pocket, which is nice while I am charging my phone on the train. It is durable; I have dropped it on a couple of occasions, and it has always been okay. I believe it came with a little holding bag (which was nice before I lost it.)..Charging: Quick to recharge (about an hour and a half on a good charger and power source) and it lasts...I was a little nervous about the lithium battery, but I honestly have had no problems. Sometimes the exterior will get hot, but after letting it “rest” for a couple of minutes, it cools off.",0
5.0,,"July 30, 2017",Yes,I was surprised by how fast this charges my phone. It went from 12% to fully charged in about  20 min. It comes with a pouch for the charger. The charge on the battery pack itself is indicated by a row of blue lights that light up in a continuous row which tells you how much energy is left. Really happy with this purchase.,1
4.0,,"July 11, 2018",Yes,I really like the size and power of this portable charger.  It charges quickly and keeps my phone (which is primarily what I'm using this for) charged for the day.  I've had a few different types over the years but I've found some of the large capacity devices to not last as long and are incredibly heavy.  I think this one is a nice medium ground of your average user.,0
5.0,,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"Small, affordable, and works great! Sleek design and fits perfectly in provided bag which stays protected in my backpack. I use it mainly for cell phone, tablet/ipad, and headphone charging during travelling and other times when power might not be immediately accessible. There are other models that offer a larger capacity and size but this fits the bill for basic, entry-level travel charging.",0
5.0,,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"I bought this charger for a recent overseas trip.  It is small and lightweight and easily fit into my small cross-body purse.  I used my phone a lot for navigating the streets of London. Since navigation will really drain a cell phone battery, it was great having this charger handy.  It seemed to charge my iPhone 8 Plus very quickly and I got 4 phone charges before I had to plug in the Anker charger.  I purchased a 4"" Amazon Basics lightning cable which fit easily into the mesh travel pouch with the charger.",0
5.0,,"March 30, 2018",Yes,This is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made and I’ve definitely gotten my money’s worth out of it. I bought it for when I was traveling since I knew I would be walking around sightseeing and didn’t want to have to worry about my phone not having charge. It worked great and gave me about 5-7 full charges on my iPhone..I now carry it wherever I go just in case I need to charge my phone or iPad. With the iPad it give me only about 3 full charges only.,0
5.0,,"January 23, 2018",Yes,"Great purchase. I used this almost everyday for my old iPhone 5s and it’s dying battery problems and it served me well. The size is so nice and convenient to store in a pocket or etc.  And for the size, this thing really held quite a number of charges on a full charge. I used this multiple times a day for my iPhone 5s. It gave me a couple full charges and I even shared this with my boyfriend sometimes. This item was so convenient and packed with juice.",0
5.0,,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"I use this battery pack for a heated shirt.  It hooks up on a side pocket.  I have used it for ten hours straight, and the battery pack is still going strong. Not cumbersome or too heavy.",1
5.0,,"December 25, 2017",Yes,I purchased one fo  myself and one as a gift.  I love this little charger - it is about three times more powerful than my older Halo one - and that's important when I am out all day and need to charge my phone.  It is small enough to put into a coat pocket.,1
5.0,,"July 7, 2018",Yes,"I use this product regularly in the summer time. It’s my lifeline for keeping my phone charged while out and about for days at a time with no reliable power source. I usually get to plug it in and charge every other day, so I’m always topped off on juice...Make sure you have a usb to wall adapter with you to actually charge the unit in addition to what you use to charge your phone or device...I purchased an off brand hard shell carrying case for the item which lets me easily store the usb charging cable, a short iPhone to usb cable and the battery pack itself. Couldn’t be more happy with my current setup.",0
5.0,,"January 30, 2017",Yes,"This little thing is a life saver.  We lost power in our home, so no WiFi.  We could however work from our phones.  But our batteries were getting low on our Note 4 phones.  With now power and now way to charge our phones, this little device came to the rescue!  We were able to keep both of our Galaxy Note 4 phones charded during the blackout which allowed us to continue to work.",1
1.0,,"November 1, 2018",Yes,Absolutely terrible. Have used this product for about 3 months now and maybe have fully charged it 20+ times. Will not charge or hold a charge anymore. I basically just rented a portable charging station for $10 a month. Super,1
5.0,,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"If this lasts it's a great purchase! Charges phone fast. You can see how much of a charge it has by the lights. Had to use my own cord but had several laying around, not sure what came with it but not for iPhone.",1
5.0,,"May 18, 2016",Yes,"I've got two Note 4 devices that are in desperate need of replacement batteries, but Samsung has had ours on back order for over a month. In order to be able to use my phone and take photos on my trip to Chicago, I needed a backup of some kind that wouldn't weigh me down. This thing is incredible. On a single charge, it fully charged my device about 4 times. I would've never been able to use my phone as much as I did without it. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.",1
5.0,,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"Love it because I hate heavy portable chargers, but couldn’t go with lighter ones because not strong enough to charger my phone until this one. Also there is a 18 month warranty so if anything goes wrong they exchange it for you. My battery life light indicater started to malfunction, and I contacted Anker about the problem. They quickly sent me a new product in the mail right away!!! Not to mention the great customer service!! I even purchased another one as a gift.",1
4.0,,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"It really charges rapidly (Can go from 15% to 100% in less than an hour). I use a Moto G4 Play...My only possible complaint after using for over two months is that it seems to not retain the same amount of charge after ~10 recharges. It still is pretty decent, but the drop is significant (If I had to guess, I'd say it retains 80% of the original charge now after recharging 10 times)...The product is very slim, very light. You can charge it over night, and I can use it about 3 times to charge my phone almost from scratch. Very useful for traveling, and also for emergencies when going out!",0
4.0,,"January 13, 2019",Yes,"I have a Samsung Galaxy 7 cell phone, a Galaxy Tab S tablet and a Motorola Droid Turbo 2, the battery pack charges them just great. For some odd reason it will not charge a Samsung Galaxy 2014 Note tablet. the 2014 Note tablet has a 6000mAh battery and the 10000mAh battery you would think should be able to charge it at least once, it doesn't even charge it at all. Both the Samsung cell phone and the tablets batteries have OEM replacement batterys installed and charge with AC chargers just fine (although the 2014 requires double the time to charge due to the size of the replacement battery. I do like when you charge the battery and it gets full it shuts off, nice feature.",0
4.0,,"February 3, 2019",Yes,Stopped holding charge after a month of use. Not heavily used or left on charger for long periods of time. Haven't dropped or done anything that should affect the product working ok.  Worked great before this..Anker company saw my review and went completely out of their way to help me out. Super customer service!!! I need to try the new charger and hopefully have better luck as I seem to be one of the few who have had issues with the initial charger.,1
5.0,,"December 8, 2017",Yes,"Bought this for a long haul trip to Tanzania and for many hours of safari, mountain climbing and hospital work. So far this power pack will charge my iphone 7 plus from dead to full twice with a little battery left in it! Good size, easy to travel with, and works very well! Good for the price.",1
5.0,,"August 23, 2018",Yes,"I bought this power bank for a trip I'll be going to later on this year. I'll have a dell tablet, and two phones that I'll be using this on, so I hope it'll last. So far so good! It feels very sturdy, the travel case is awesome, and it just looks and feels like quality. It's also extremely portable! I'll be updating this review if anything comes up!",0
2.0,,"September 3, 2018",Yes,"After a year of rare use (like once every couple of months), only two out of four of the LED indicator lights turn on, even after charging for 24 hours. I don’t know if that means only charges to half capacity, or if it charges to full capacity and the LED indicator lights are defective, so it’s a mystery as to how much juIce is actually in there.",0
5.0,,"July 16, 2018",Yes,"Amazing!  I bought this to bring on my trip to Ireland so I can recharge my phone on the plane and while I was in transit if needed. It worked great! I can't tell you how many times I was able to charge my phone, a true life saver in many instances especially since I use GPS on my phone a lot and had to look up stuff. Ps i have a Samsung edge 7 and it worked like a charm!!",0
5.0,,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"I really like the compact size of this charger. It has really come in handy when I’m out and about. Anker also has an awesome support team: had an issue where the pouch cord for the charger came unraveled and I could no longer close the bag. I reached out to Support to let them know of the issue and they shipped me a new pouch at no charge! They also did a follow-up to make sure everything was good. Thanks, Anker Support!",1
4.0,,"August 23, 2017",Yes,Nice charger but beware of certain USB charging cables not charging the battery itself. Also takes a very long time to charge...Other than that its great and last a good while!,2
5.0,,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"This holds SO MUCH POWER and charges crazy fast.  I charged from about 20% to nearly full during my 30 minute commute home, and I'll be able to charge at least 5 more times before I have to charge the PowerCore.  It's also very small - smaller than my phone (though a bit fatter) and comes with a soft case/bag that keeps the cord with it and keeps it all safe in my purse.  A really great purchase.",0
5.0,,"August 8, 2018",Yes,"I have been using it for months now and I do not know how I did without one. It holds its battery life for a long time, and I can charge my Samsung Galaxy S6 three times before I have to charge it. Very happy!",1
5.0,,"October 29, 2018",Yes,"Took on trip to Thailand, loved how long the battery lasted cuz phone runs out all the time taking photos.  Easy to recharge, red color easy to find in purse, size nice to pair behind phone with a short charging cord.  Very happy to update battery that lasts longer and recharges faster. Love Anker batteries",0
5.0,,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"EDITED TO ADD: The wonderful customer service team reached out to me and replaced the power banks with no issue. They sent me a message very quickly and were very sweet about the entire issue. The new power banks look great, no scratches or signs of use at all. Thanks Anker!..I just received these yesterday and while the quality seems great they appeared to be used, which I’m not super happy about. The surface of them is all scratched. I would like to speak to someone about it because it doesn’t sit will with me. Would be willing to improve my review if I’m able to speak with someone.",0
4.0,,"August 11, 2017",Yes,"The anker powercore 10000 is very easy to use saves energy and great for storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, whenever the power is out or you need to find a safe spot to keep your family safe and electronics chargered. this product is also great for long car rides waiting for a flight when all the outlets are taken or in the flight. this batterys power level is low enough to go on airplanes. The battery fits in backpacks or bags. it comes with a micro usb charger by anker and a travel bag to keep it from scratching. there is only one problem with this charger, it takes around 5 hours to fully charge, but I just leave it charging every night before I go to bed. I rarely use outlets anymore to plug in my phone. I have the iPhone 7 and the apple watch series 1 and it charges both of them very well. The battery also saves power when your device is full the battery turns off automatically saving power for your next charge.",0
5.0,,"December 6, 2018",Yes,Great back up battery used it for my entire vacation out of the country and it was a nice reassurance to know that I had a back up power pack for my cell phone and other electronic devices. The battery charge time from empty to full does take about six hours but the battery pack lasts for 3 to 4. Phone charges,0
5.0,,"April 2, 2018",Yes,I have owned other power banks before but this is the best one so far. It is fast charging and easy to use. It is light weight and I can charge my phone at least 2.5 times with this before having to charge it. It is also great that it comes with a decent size charging cable which makes it possible for me to use my phone if needed while it charges. Love this!,0
5.0,,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"I thought this charger was amazing for the price. i bought it specifically for a camping music festival. One charge lasted me almost two full days alternating between charging my phone and Apple watch. This price is super affordable but the product does not feel cheap at all, it is very high quality. Only thing that was a little confusing is that there is no on/off button. If you press the one button on it, the lights indicating how charged it is will come on, but these lights will also come on automatically if you plug a device into it to charge.",0
5.0,,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"Loved this little charger.  Have had it about 1.5 years though and the USB port broke so that I can no longer inset the cable.  As usual, it broke just after the warranty expired :(...Amending this review as the company reached out to me and sent me a replacement unit even though mine was past warranty.  Great customer service!",0
5.0,,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"Since my phone (an old Samsung Galaxy Note 5) has rather poor battery life, having a portable charger is very useful. This charger not only has enough capacity to charge my phone around three times, but it is reasonably light, small (about the size of a deck of cards), and of great build quality. Would definitely recommend.",0
5.0,,"December 14, 2018",Yes,Never thought I'd need done of these or use them. But I took a couple different models with me on a trip recently and these things made it so easy to top my phone and tablet up for extra hours of video and picture taking. They are lightweight even the bigger 20k mAh version. They charge pretty quick too.,0
5.0,,"May 3, 2017",Yes,Awesome charger. Bought to have with us on our vacation and was able to charge my wife's phone and my phone at least 3 full charges and then then sum. Works great...does get really warm when charging up and also when charging your phone so make sure you have it in an area that has some air moving around it. Charges phones fast.,1
5.0,,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"This is the third portable power bank made by Anker that I have purchased. None of them have disappointed me. It charges an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy multiple times.  I only purchased this one for its smaller size. Although they are still portable, my older power banks are twice the size.",0
5.0,,"July 28, 2018",Yes,Very powerful charger in such a compact size! I have a larger Anker battery charger that I use more when I am just going to the pool or doing activities locally but this is amazing for travel. Took this on our trip to Barcelona and Rome. We used our phones like crazy all day long for GPS and music while we were out of the hotel all day and this was great for keeping those charged!!,0
5.0,,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"I have a tendency to let me phone get all the way to ~5% before scrambling to find a way to charge it. I now keep this battery pack in my purse and use it at least once a week. It fits in my back pocket, coat pocket, or purse which is great when I will be out all day/night. It holds 4 full charges but i have net to use them all without reloading it. I've used it while traveling and while going out for the night. I don't have to worry about not using my phone in case of emergencies. I highly recommend this product.",0
5.0,,"December 28, 2018",Yes,"I travel a lot on business and have used several battery packs in the past.  The previous versions, from other companies, were ok, but rather bulky.  This one is small enough to carry around in a coat pocket with very little addition of weight vs. the previous units I carried on business trips.",0
5.0,,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"I really love this product. On one charge of the battery pack, I can fully charge my cell phone 3-4 times easy, and maybe a little extra juice to squeak by on on the 5th charge. The pack feels very solid and well built and comes with a little mesh bag to store it in. I'm really satisfied with this purchase. It definitely saved me so much time and hassle on my recent trip when I was out of the hotel and on my phone much of the day, it kept things charged and working great!",0
5.0,,"February 2, 2018",Yes,"This portable charger is the perfect size to fit in a purse or even a pocket! I've been able to charge my iPhone 7 at least twice on one charge of the PowerCore. It was so convenient that I would occasionally use this charger even if I was at home, just because my charging cord wasn't long enough to reach the nearest outlet while still using my phone. However, after about 5 months of use, static electricity got the best of my charger while it was plugged in the wall... I emailed the seller to see if they could help me out; since the product was still under warranty they sent me a brand new PowerCore, shipped the next day! It's on the way now and I can't wait for it to get here because even just a few days without it while traveling has been tough. Thanks, guys!",0
5.0,,"July 28, 2017",Yes,"Love this item. I am a professional dog walker thus I track walks via my cell phone. There have been times where my phone battery is dying but I am currently on a walk, I need to imput info or reach out to a dog owner but i need to save whatb little is left of my battery. Anker is small and light enough to keep in my back, and makes things much more convenient especially when I am doing back to back walks. Love it!",0
5.0,,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE: Anker reached out to me to send a replacement. Received and it works just as it should! Love that it holds multiple charges. Happy to support a company that takes the time to make sure every customer is satisfied. I'll continue to buy Anker products with confidence...PREVIOUS: I have a few Anker products and always loved the quality but this power bank missed the mark. First outing and it won’t charge my iphone. Not the cable, and I missed the return window by a day. Really disappointed this failed me in a time of need!",6
4.0,,"May 31, 2017",Yes,"I purchased one of these for my wife. She started playing Pokemon Go last year and asked for a portable charger. The charger itself is amazing. Excellent for the price. The only reason I am giving 4 and not 5 stars is due to the fact it can't be put near a Metrocard. If you leave the charger close to your wallet/Metrocard (NYC), it will desmagnetize it. Would I recommend this product to friends? For sure! (But be careful with your metrocards!)",1
5.0,,"December 15, 2016",Yes,"This PowerCore 10000 is a fantastic product.  There are already many reviews of this product in terms of testing and charging, so I will not go into details as others have already said what a wonderful product this is.  I am in full agreement with them.  The unit I received on a full charge was able to charge an Android Galaxy S6 Edge twice and an iPhone 5S twice until the battery pack was depleted.  The footprint is small enough to fit in your pocket.  This is a must buy just for the convenience of it, especially if you are traveling and have limited areas for a power source.",0
5.0,,"November 22, 2017",Yes,"Purchased this to get me thru Hurricane Irma so I would have cell phone power.  It was perfect.  It is kinda heavy for everyday carrying around in my purse, but if I know I will need it, its worth having with me.  I would recommend this item.  My first battery pack purchase but my sister stated they having been using Anker for a few years, so that made me feel good about this choice.",0
5.0,,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"This guy is the MVP for real. He charges my phone lightning fast (when I remember to charge him up that is). Honestly, its a life saver. I work in a career where sometimes the car charging just doesn't cut it and this gets me up and running in no time. Actually crazy how fast I get power back and the battery percentage climbs. Highly recommend- have bought two now (one for a friend) and can't complain. Love it!",0
5.0,,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"I bought this powercore in white, for my wife as a gift and it works wonderfully.  Facebook drains her phone quite quickly, and this powercore recharges the phone pretty quickly and it can do 2+charges on her iphone.  However, she doesn't share it with me, so I purchased it in black, and now I am as happy as a clam.  I am not exactly sure why clams are happy, they do not even have a pearl or anything.  Maybe they have found contentment in the simple life of a gastropod.",0
5.0,,"August 10, 2017",Yes,"I have used this power bank every day for the past two weeks. It's so convenient to carry around and comes with a small mesh pouch..It charges itself to four bars in a few hours via usb, then charges my Samsung galaxy phone from 0-100% in about 1.5 - 2 hours, like a normal wall charger would. It charges my phone 2-3 times completely, as stated. Definitely recommend! :)",1
5.0,,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"This is my second one because i gifted the first. I love this thing because i get like 3 or 4 full charges, but it's still small enough to fit in my pocket with my phone if I need to charge on the fly. One thing I noticed is you really need to use the short micro usb to charge the device. Otherwise it takes very long.",0
5.0,,"July 10, 2017",Yes,"Now I own two of these batteries, one for the wife and one for me.  They hold a charge for what seems like an eternity.  They provide a fast charge for all my Apple devices.  A lot of bang for the price.",2
5.0,,"December 8, 2017",Yes,"This product is the best, actually I have 2, it's incredibly fast in charging and now to me it doesn't make any sense to have my phone connected with the classic cable to the wall plug. It last for 6 charges... perfect for my Iphone X, Iphone 6 and bluetooth headphones...They have also another model, bigger but skinny and in one side it has rubber - which is really cool. Same speed IQ",0
5.0,,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this battery backup for a trip to Europe and for when I'm away from electricity. I could get 4-5 full charges, easily before I had to plug this Anker Cell in to recharge.  I'd purchase this again. It came with a mesh bag to store the battery and the charge cord..Update: As of Dec 2018, this battery still holds a charge. I just pulled it from my back pack and it still has a full charge from Sept.",0
5.0,,"May 24, 2018",Yes,"Wow!!! Why didnt I buy this a long time ago. Small yet powerful. Once its charged, I was able to fully charge my devices 3 times almost 4. People get this item Anker is a great company. I also ordered a usb cord to take along with me. This item goes with me everywhere no more looking for sn outlet. Will order another. Awsome product. If I could give 10 stars I would⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",0
3.0,,"January 4, 2019",Yes,"It just doesn't work anymore. It looks like it is working, but my phone is not charging. Another Amazon product I am disappointed in. Damn.",1
5.0,,"September 1, 2018",Yes,"This was a life saver when I went to Africa.  I'm used to being in my car or in my classroom and can charge my three year old iphone whenever I need, but I was on the go a lot and needed a portable charger.  This lasted a long time and charged quickly.  Great buy, and I now keep it in my purse at all times.  Love it.",0
5.0,,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"I sometimes work in location sound on film sets in Hollywood, and nobody likes it when the sound guy has to stop to change the batteries. I keep my Zoom H6N mixer interface plugged into this thing, and it automatically draws power from it instead of the 3 AA batteries that it normally runs on. I've been able to have the Zoom plugged in for whole 12 hour shoots and it's kept everything powered the whole time. If I could plug my lavaliers into one of these, I would!",0
5.0,,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"This is a great charger.  I previously had a different one that gradually quit working in less than a year, no warrenty.  My Anker has an 18 month warrenty, plus I get 3 charges at a time out of it for my iPhone.",1
5.0,,"August 29, 2016",Yes,"Excellent portable charger.  I have a Motorola Droid Maxx that is very finicky about what chargers it works with, so I was really happy that this charger worked with my phone.  It is nice and small and charges my device very quickly.  I was also pleasantly surprised  to find that the charger came with a travel pouch that I can carry around the charger and cable in.  A very nice touch.  Like many, I have been playing Pokemon Go a lot recently, and this little charger has been a lifesaver.  Highly recommended.",0
5.0,,"November 7, 2016",Yes,"I bought this for when I go on my 50mile bike rides because my phone drains from using GPS and music and the occasional social media app. I've also used just whenever I know power will not be available for a period of time. So far I've had no issues with it. It's compact to carry on my bike pouch or throw in a back pack. I probably wouldn't recommend it in the pocket though,  just to uncomfortable for me. Size comparison would be little smaller than a deck of cards. The only improvement I would make is the outer shell feels cheap. Maybe if it was rubber texture it would be nice.",0
5.0,,"June 12, 2018",Yes,"This charger is the perfect travel size and worked perfectly for 18 months. Then, one day it simply stopped charging (both itself and other devices). After contacting Anker customer support, they immediately offered to send out a replacement (from a factory certified stock of chargers that were returned by customers after little or no use). No cost to me, and I did not even have to send back the defective model. I had a new charger by the end of the week. I have always liked Anker products, and now I know that the customer service is top notch.",0
1.0,,"October 20, 2017",Yes,My anker is barely a month old and it is already giving me trouble. It doesn't charge on my first try. After many tried it gets going. Very disappointed and disheartened.,4
5.0,,"October 12, 2017",Yes,Awesome battery backup to have around. I can charge my phone multiple times before this unit looses power. I have this and another Anker backup. I am a fan of their products as I also have a mouse from them. The blue indicator lights are an awesome feature because it lets you know how much power is left before you have to charge it again. Purchased this for hurricane Irma and even though it didn't arrive in time for that I am happy to have it around for future storms or travel.,0
4.0,,"March 27, 2019",Yes,I love this charger. I take it on the road with me all the time. Great on ong flights.  Only problem is you can’t just plug it into the phone to charge it you have to hit the button to turn it on and it also turns off by itself after a while.  Not sure why,0

Most have worked excellent. The one that failed was replaced by Anker. Definitely a product and company to have confidence in. thank you guys.",1
5.0,,"September 6, 2017",Yes,"It's about the size of a pack of cigarettes and weighs a little more than your phone. Dead simple to operate and holds a charge for a looooong time. I've charged an iPhone 6+ and it dipped from 4 lights (full charge) to 3 (75% charge). Admittedly that's pretty unscientific but you get the idea. If you're on the road or out in the woods without access to a plug, this thing is an absolute life-saver. I also find that even when I do have access to power, sometimes it's just easier to plug into this device than to be tied to a wall outlet.  It charges fast, too.  The best thing is that once it's fully charged, it doesn't seem to loose anything in storage. Which I thought it might, but it doesn't. I went about 2 months without using it and it still shows full charge. You won't regret this little guy.",5
3.0,,"December 29, 2018",Yes,"I was unsure initially as it didnt seem to at first charge my battery, but it works as it should. I've charged it 2 times and I think I've had it 2.5 weeks or 3 weeks cant remember. However it charges my Bose bluetooth speaker and my phone well. I do recommend",0
5.0,,"September 16, 2017",Yes,"This is the best portable charger I've ever had. It lasts forever (not literally). I'm from FL and with this past storm, hurricane Irma, I decided to buy this in case my power went out. My power did go out for days and I was able to charge my phone 3 times, my sisters phone, moms, dads, and both grandparents and it still had 1 notch left of power (there's 4 notches). What a great investment! I highly recommend.",1
5.0,,"April 3, 2019",Yes,This battery pack can charge my phone AT LEAST 4 times. I have an older phone and the battery life isn't as good as it used to be. I find myself having to charge my phone 1-2 times per day so this battery has been a life saver. Definitely worth the money!,0
5.0,,"March 21, 2019",Yes,"This charger is great.  I typically buy the cheapest chargers, a charge is a charge, right? I paid a bit more for this one and I am glad I did. It was worth it.  It takes in a charge slowly, i began to wonder if it was working.  However, gives out a lot of power and seems to hold the charge a long time.  I am very pleased with my puchase.",0
5.0,,"March 20, 2019",Yes,"I have had trouble finding a battery pack that was compact while also having the capacity I wanted.  Because I go hiking and spend a lot of time outdoors, both were important components of the product I was looking for in a battery pack.  This unit takes on both of these tasks very well--smaller than my wallet while having enough energy to charge my iPhone almost 5 times.  Thanks Anker!",0
1.0,,"April 10, 2019",Yes,"This power bank loses it charge really quickly which is not expected from Anker. I have been using it for quiet now time now. At first it was great, but now it take longer time to fully charge and loses it's rechargeable quickly. Disappointed with the product.",0
5.0,,"August 19, 2018",Yes,"Love Anker's products. I've had two different phone chargers - one that had a battery capable of around 7 charges/2 ports and this product. I personally use them less for every day purposes but heavily rely on them while traveling (mainly short few day trips)...The product itself is perfect for traveling, extremely durable and holds true to the battery charges. Only features to note are probably since the charge is so well, it does take a bit longer to actually charge the batteries. Also due to the great charge, I think Anker products in general can feel heavier than others (why I prefer for travel rather than carrying it every day in my bag)...Highly recommend!",0
5.0,,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"Works as advertised. Arrived with 50% charge, so was able to test out of the box. One of the cables I already owned decrease my phones charge instead of increase it. The instructions reccomend using their cable, which when used charged from 90 to 100% in less than 5 mins. Would reccomend to others. Size is similar to that of a deck of cards and weighs more.",0
5.0,,"August 26, 2018",Yes,"I've had this battery pack for 14 months and it started to experience an issue where the lights that normally flash when you plug a device in for charging was flashing with no device. I contacted Anker customer support and after an exchange of a couple of emails they are sending a replacement. The only suggestion I have is that Anker make the serial number larger or make the text white to contrast against the battery case. For the customer, buy a magnifying glass or use your smart phone camera to magnify the image (that's what worked for me)! The replacement process went great and a replacement has been sent. I am eagerly waiting for its arrival.",0
5.0,,"September 11, 2018",Yes,"Bought this for a trekking trip to the Nordic wilderness and let's say, it was reliable, held the charge and charged fast. I will absolutely recommend this product.

3.0,,"September 7, 2017",Yes,"I had ordered the product for an iPhone but it came with a usb cable for an android phone. I was hoping to not have to buy the cable for an iphone separately. Also, it wasn't that light (I used to have a Xiaomi Power Bank before and it was way lighter). I will update my review and give more stars if I find it to be more performant than my Xiaomi Power bank.",1
5.0,,"March 13, 2019",Yes,"Fantastic product! It’s been a little over 6 months and it’s still holding up like new. It gives my iPhone 7 about 4-5 cycles of charge. It’s a sleek, simple battery pack that fits in your hand comfortably...One thing I have to say is the string of the little bag that holds the battery pack already ripped. I understand that it’s not the focus of this product, but I am inconvenienced by this because I have to look to buy a separate tiny drawstring bag.",0
5.0,,"October 22, 2018",Yes,This is really great! I use it all of the time and I love it. It holds a charge for a long time and is nice and compact so its east to pack and carry around.

5.0,,"June 11, 2018",Yes,I really like this charger. The battery last a long time. I once used it to charge my iPad and it only used up have. It charges at regular paste. My friend has an other charger the same brand and charged super fast but it's battery doesn't last as long. When I tried to charge my iPad with his it charged it fast but didn't give it as much charge as this battery did. I think it can fully charge about 3 phones. I haven't seen it but my friend that has the same charger told me and he really likes it.,0
4.0,,"August 13, 2018",Yes,"Quit working after 4 months..Amazon wouldn't let me return it, so I wrote a bad review.

I don't think I've ever had such high-quality customer service. I really appreciate it. I'm hoping it was just an anomaly that my first one quit on me. It worked great before it didn't. It charges my phone faster than plugging it in the wall.",1
5.0,,"April 29, 2017",Yes,Just what I needed. Fasont charge too. I like that it charges just as fast as a wall outlet. My car barely charges my s7 but this moves it quick. Nice size. I only need an extra phone charge so why get a jumbo sized unit - this is a perfect size/weight vs charge needed. It's about 2/3 the size of my galaxy s7 and just a little thicker. The led's denoting the charge level are perfect - 4 leds to let you know where you are.,0
5.0,,"October 6, 2018",Yes,My phone battery has been draining a bit faster these days so I purchased this to keep it juiced throughout the day. It works great! The charge on the battery itself lasts a long time and can be used several times before recharging. I’ve never used it to fully charge my phone from anything lower than 20% so that would make a difference if you do. It’s easy to use and carry. My boyfriend has the bigger version and he loves his. I’m better about charging my phone overnight so I didn’t think I’d need the big one like his. I definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a portable charger!,0
5.0,,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"I bought this battery to go to a very cold football game, knowing my phone battery would drain over the several hours. I am glad I did! This power core was fantastic - was not affected by the cold, charged several phones several times. I thought it would go in a drawer and I would only use it sometimes. But I use it all the time! I highly recommend it!",0
5.0,,"July 16, 2016",Yes,I think I have a defective one because it takes 20+ hours to charge from the anker 40 watt 5 port desktop charger and this is when the battery pack isn't completely dead either. I've reached out to anker to see if this is expected behavior...Edit:  I contacted anker and they were super helpful in resolving this issue.  Turns out the micro USB cable I was using was causing the slow charging.  I switched over to using the micro cable that came with the battery pack and it charged from dead to full in around 5 hours.,3
4.0,,"January 5, 2018",Yes,"Anker makes the BEST POWERBANKS.  I love thier Power IQ technology.  Being an iPhone user I think the IQ tech chargers my iPhone faster than any other charger.  I think the PowerBanks with an IQ 2.0 port charge my iPhone faster than a standard wall charger.  I have had some problems with the QuickCharge port (QC3) it only trickle charges my iPhone, I think it's made for Samsung phones but not sure.  Just be sure to check the PowerBank ports before you buy... iPhone user should look for Power IQ 2.0; Samsung users should look for QuickCharge (QC3)...Size does matter, you need something for the weekend camping trip get yourself a larger Powercore 20000 mAh or higher..Need something to just get you through the day the Powercore 10000 mAh will be more than enough..My wife uses the Powercore II 6700 with her iPhone 7 and it gives her a full charge fast...Love Anker Products. Anker stands by their products and replaces anything for free as long as it's under warranty (usualy 12-18 months depending on the product).  There is 1 thing I hate about Anker customer support, they are completely impersonal.  You'll read this grievance in my most of my recent reviews, I'll explain and let you decide for yourself if Anker Support could have, should have, treated me better.  Just bought multiple items as Christmas gifts for 16 family members (16 power banks, 16 lightning cables, 8 micro USB cables, 8 Wall Chargers, 5 Car Chargers)  Not only did I spend a lot of money but I gave Anker 16 new customers that are already purchasing more Anker products.  So when my personal 6ft Powerline+ lightning cable broke after a few months of minimal use (exposing the wire) I sent in my request for a new cable.  I explained how much I love Anker, how I just got my entire family Anker products and got Anker a bunch of new customers and I was surprised the cable broke so easily.  I asked if they could replace my cable with the 6ft Powerline+ II, figuring it may be more durable.  Their reply was surprising, they wanted to refund me for my cable so I could purchased the newer cable.  They did not offer a discount for the new cable, so essential they were not willing to give me the newer cable for free, it would have cost me a few more dollars and honestly I can't imagine it really costing Anker more than a few cents for the upgraded cable.  This is such a huge turn off, I'm the customer you want, not just a guy who buys a cable, but someone who buys many, many products from you, gives your products to all of my family members, and promotes your products to everyone... So many of my friends have also gotten Anker cables based on my recommendation. Highly disappointed in your customer service skills Anker, still love your products but I don't plan on promoting your products until you learn how to treat your GREAT CUSTOMERS BETTER.",3
5.0,,"December 4, 2018",Yes,I recently lost mine and cant live without one and will be getting another asap. My boyfriend has one and he won't let me steal his. I will however probably look for a lighter version if I dont loose the power. The 10000 charges fast which is nice when traveling and whatnot. But like I mentioned it is heavy and I carry a small purse so a smaller size would be more ideal. I most likely would sacrifice time charging if I wanted those things. Regardless...still a great charger.,0
5.0,,"September 28, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this using overnight shipping, anticipating the arrival of Hurricane Irma. I fully charged it overnight. The next day, my electricity went out, my cell phone died, and I had this little gem to recharge my phone, a friend's phone, and still had extra power left in the Anker PowerCore! Our phones fully charged very fast! I take it with me wherever I go! It's smaller than my iPhone, lightweight, fits nicely in my purse! BUY THIS!! You won't be disappointed!!..Update: I bought 2 more as gifts! They loved it and give it 5 stars!*********",0
5.0,,"February 26, 2019",Yes,Bought to have on me for a conference.  I used it a lot since I didn’t have access to an outlet often.  I haven’t used it much since due to not having a reason.  But recently during a storm I made sure it was fully charged to have on standby incase of a power outage.,0
5.0,,"April 28, 2017",Yes,Purchased this for my husband as he is on the road a lot and has to be able to be reached on cell phone at all times.  He LOVES this !!  Has gotten five full charges off one full charged unit.  Each charge only takes about a half hour.  He doesn't leave home without it now.  Will definitely be purchasing one of these for myself.,1
5.0,,"January 26, 2017",Yes,"I bought this for the Women's March on Washington DC.  I charged it the night before.  On the day, it kept both my phone and my friend's phone charged from early morning to evening.  If we had not had it we would have run out of charge by 11 am.  And it was lightweight and easy to carry in a pocket of my coat.  Great purchase.",1
5.0,,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"**Editing this original review, I have it below for reference***.After I wrote this review, I immediately heard from the company and they expedited a new one for me. They were quick to respond and I had no expectations they would even reach out, but I am glad they did because I really like the charge and it's worked well for me.  Highly recommend!..--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.I have had this charger for only 6 months and it doesn’t hold a charge anymore. I had it plugged in all night and when I checked it in the morning it only charged half way. A week ago, it would only change 3/4 of the way.",0
5.0,,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"While traveling for 38 hours on 4 flights to the other side of the world, this kept my phone, iPad, &amp; Kindle charged. Later, while working in the bush in Botswana, I was able to charge my devices for the 4 days I was away from a power source. This is dourable and easy to transport, plus it's small &amp; lightweight.",0
5.0,,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"This is a great charger--compact, gets multiple phone charges in full (I would say 4-5 full phone charges) OR 1 full iPad charge with a little extra battery to spare. I typically use it by boosting my charge on my phone at work from about 20% to 80% and I will do this daily--I only recharge the Anker every 2 weeks or so. I've been using it for about a year or so and it still works just was well as the day I bought it! Great quality and value!",0
5.0,,"April 15, 2019",Yes,I've been charging the hell out of my phone and everyone else's phones. They now call me charger man,1
5.0,,"September 19, 2016",Yes,So far I'm pretty happy about this battery pack. It's smaller than I expected which is nice. It can with a carry pouch and it's own cable. If you need a smart looking power pack that's easily carried and still had a lot of power is recommend this one. Part of the reason I decided on this power pack over some others was some cables I bought from Anker that I really enjoyed so I went with the same brand. Did not disappoint. Keep up the great work Anker!,1
5.0,,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"This little thing rocks! It takes a very little time to charge it, but it recharges my phone super fast! It's nice and small, and comes in a little case for when it's in my purse. So far, I've charge my phone about 5 times using it, and it still has 50% charge left in it. I can't recommend this highly enough.",0
5.0,,"March 12, 2018",Yes,This charger has been a godsend!  We use it at theme parks to recharge our phones throughout the day.  And most recently we were without power for two days and this was perfect!  It stays charged a long time.  I think it was about 2 months from the last time I charged it and it was still almost fully charged.  It can fully charge multiple devices before it needs to be recharged itself.  I absolutely love it!,0
5.0,,"September 28, 2018",Yes,"Although I like Anker products in general, I received this powerbank an hour back  and  only 2 LEDs light up while charging ( 2 others are dead ) .Seems like they shipped defective piece...Update - Anker proactively reaches out to me and  replaced the battery pack and it works perfectly. Great customer service",0
1.0,,"February 11, 2019",Yes,I have had mine for about a year now and even though the unit is fully charged it has stopped working. When I plug my phone in it will start charging and then the unit turns off and will not turn back on. Really frustrated by this and would not recommend nor would I buy again. I reached out the company and was informed that because my 18month limited warranty had ended (literally a month ago) that I was out of luck. Pretty disappointed and won't be purchasing again.,0
4.0,,"March 24, 2018",Yes,"I am an Amazon Flex driver.  Using my phone continuously for scanning and navigating drains the phone battery quickly.  This Anker recharges my phone very quickly and I can easily carry it in my pocket while it is charging my phone.  I bought two, my husband delivers as well.  The price went up or I would give it 5 stars!",0
5.0,,"April 8, 2019",Yes,"I needed a portable battery for a trip and this was a LIFESAVER! I recommend fully charging this before using so that you can recharge your phone as much as you need. I was able to charge mine and a few friends' phones who needed a little extra battery boost. I'm an iPhone use so I use the lightning cable- which when you stuff in a purse with the actual battery it can be a bit bulky (if you're carrying a small bag). However, this small inconvenience is easy to look past because the battery is SO good. Strongly recommend to have this for any occasion, like travelling or being away from a charger for hours at a time!!",0
5.0,,"December 14, 2016",Yes,I bought this for my wife to replace a pair of aging batteries that she was using.  This is twice as much capacity and the unit takes up less space than one of her old ones.  I looked at the specs and thought well it is small but I didn't really appreciate the tininess until it arrived.  It is just about smaller than my billfold...She has been using it bunches since she got it.  Works great and she likes the carrying bag that it came with.,0
5.0,,"November 22, 2018",Yes,I had an issue with my original Anker PowerCore 10000 where it wouldn't charge all the way. I contacted Anker's customer support team and they were EXTREMELY helpful! They went above and beyond. They sent me a replacement charger and I received it very quickly. I am extremely satisfied with them. One of the best experiences I've ever had with customer support. I would definitely recommend them!,1
5.0,,"November 21, 2017",Yes,"This is an edit to a previous review. I had a version that quickly broke and I could not charge my phone. After I left my review, Anker contacted me. They assisted me and sent me a replacement product (I was still within the warranty) with phenomenal customer service. I'll definitely be purchasing again from Anker...When my product worked, it was great. Despite not being a Quickcharge rated product, it still charged my phone very quickly and I could charge multiple times.",0
5.0,,"April 15, 2018",Yes,When I first purchased this item I was disappointed because it stopped working after using it twice. After writing my original review the company reached out and within a week I was sent a brand new product without having to pay anything. I appreciate the quick response and wonderful assistance! The issue with the original was an issue with the battery; I’m happy to report the replacement has been great and no issues! It’s a nice product for a good price I would recommend.,1
5.0,,"January 21, 2018",Yes,This is great.  We used it while on vacation in Disneyland when we didn't have any options to charge our phones. Kept our phones charged all day. We also take it camping and use it to take with us during the day to charge the kids tablets. Has a long charge,1
5.0,,"November 20, 2018",Yes,This product is amazing. I was tired of my phone constantly dying on me while I was out and having to look for an outlet to charge. This product gives me the peace of mind that no matter what I will be fine when I go out. That feeling of being worryfree is so relaxing. I had a situation where mine wasn’t fully charging anymore and Anker showed me the best customer service ever. I explained my problem to them and they sent a replacement immediately and I haven’t encountered any problems since. I have been using Anker products for years now and will continue to do so with no hesitation. I highly recommend this product to anyone out there.,0
5.0,,"October 2, 2018",Yes,This worked great for a trip to Europe to keep my iPhone charged.Good for more than a day of continuous use on an iPhone 7 plus,1
5.0,,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"A couple of years ago I bought an Anker external battery that was shaped like a lipstick. It worked fine for about two years, then just stopped working. I tried this and this one seems to be sturdier. I also can charge for longer periods of time.",0
5.0,,"July 26, 2016",Yes,"Great item for an emergency need of power.  I take this everywhere I go.  I fully charged it 3 months ago,  forgot about it and check it the other day and it still had full power.  Its small,  very portable and great for trips when you cant get to an outlet.  Fully charges my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge more than 2 times over.  Not like the other ones where its too wide or too long,  this can actually fit in your pocket.  Overall,  its small, simple and yet very useful with plenty of power.",0
5.0,,"April 8, 2018",Yes,I used to use a cheap five below charger that would never last longer than five minutes. This portable charging pack is great. I typically can use it for four different complete(10% to 100%)charging sessions. It is very compact and convenient.,1
4.0,,"March 26, 2019",Yes,"I wasn't expecting much, but I had an Amazon gift card that I needed to use so I thought this would be a cool affordable little charger. First off, it was smaller than I had thought. It fits great into the small pockets in my backpack for school. It also came with a nice little bag for it or some extra cables to want to carry with it. The battery life was great and lived up to what is advertised. The only thing that was annoying was the charge time. It took a very long time to charge up to full, so if you are planning to take it somewhere I would start charging it the day before.",0
5.0,,"June 15, 2017",Yes,"I've only had this a week but it's working great. Left it to charge overnight at first. The next day it charged my phone to 100% in about 90 minutes, and charged the phone 4 times fully before getting to 1 light. I recharged the PowerCore at one light rather than waiting for it to die completely. This will be really handy on road trips. I chose this one over a larger one because it's so lightweight, which helps in a packed purse or backpack. Very happy with the purchase.",0
5.0,,"July 2, 2016",Yes,"Agree with all the other 5-star reviews.  This portable charger has enough charges to spare.  Used it all around our recent European tour when I was using my iPhone 5 continuously and I never drained the charger in the course of a day.  Even when the charger is down to minimal charge, it will still fully charge overnight with a 24 watt charging block.  This is equivalent to the larger charging block that comes with the full size iPad or you can purchase an Anker dual 24 watt charging block from Amazon that does a great job for the charger and another device at the same time.",0
5.0,,"September 6, 2016",Yes,"I have an old HTC M7 whose battery has progressively deteriorated over the years. The battery being unremovable leaves me no other option but to use an external pack like the Anker or risk tearing apart the phone and installing a new battery. The Anker is compact with a high capacity and effectively meets my needs. In addition, I have noticed that the Anker charges my phone much faster than a wall charger which is great. I am satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this product",0
4.0,,"September 22, 2016",Yes,"At first, it was great. Charged super fast. I thought it was the best thing I've bought in a while. Then, it stopped charging fast. After posting a bad review, Anker got in touch and were very friendly and sent a replacement cord, as it seemed the charging cord was faulty. Happy that Anker wants happy customers. Would buy again",4
4.0,,"February 14, 2018",Yes,"Edit: After the original device broke, Anker contacted me to replace it under their warranty program that their devices come with. A new portable battery bank was sent out promptly and is now working flawlessly. The broken one was the first Anker product I have had a bad experience with, but their customer service and attention to replacing the defective device is a further reason why I seek out Anker products...Original Review: Worked well for the first six months and then stopped working.",0
5.0,,"September 29, 2018",Yes,This is the second charger that I have purchased from Anker. The first one has been working well. But this item failed to be re-charged within 2 weeks after I bought it. So I have to return it. I give it a 2 star because I am satisfied with my another anker power bank...Update:.I returned the failed power bank to Anker. I was contacted by Anker after they found my review above. They offered me a free PowerCore 10000 to retry. I highly appreciate their concern for the interest of customers. I have received a new PowerCore 10000 and have tested it for a couple times. So far so good. So I decide to change my review on this product to a 5-star.,0
1.0,,"February 28, 2019",Yes,"Well, this did not take long at all. Looks like Anker is skipping on build quality and QA. The unit is not charging anymore, just 1 LED flashing. I sent it back. It's good that these carry warranty. Anker, please clean up your act and do better!",0
5.0,,"August 26, 2016",Yes,"You can never have enough external chargers and I like this one because it is compact and fits easily into most of my bags. It is still pretty weighty like its larger counterparts, however, so keep that in mind when you're stuffing your bag full. I use this to mainly charge my iPhone and Kindle when I'm travelling since those are the two devices I manage to kill the fastest. This does a great job of getting them both back to full charge and still have some juice leftover.",0
5.0,,"May 4, 2017",Yes,I am very happy with this portable phone charger.  It is built well and works without and problems.  It quickly charges my ZTE Zmax Pro phone and I love the status check button to see how much charge it has left.  Comes with a nice mesh bag to carry the unit in and a charging cord.  Highly recommend!,1
5.0,,"July 5, 2016",Yes,"I'm picky about what I drop money on, and Anker has proved itself worthy. Tested it out over the Independence Day weekend-- charged a Lightdow sports camera two full times, an iPhone 6s almost four times (from 20% to 100%), and an iPhone 6s plus 30% (only because they didn't want to charge it all the way) with still some juice left according to the indicator light. Trust me, worth every penny! Looked around Target and Walmart for a portable charger before searching up Amazon, and bulky batteries with only 6000mAh cost at least thirty bucks. And it's about the size of a credit card and light enough to hardly notice it in your pocket. Perfect for EDC.",2
5.0,,"May 28, 2017",Yes,"I am really impressed with this portable power source! It holds the charge a long time when on standby - after sitting for at least 3 weeks, it only lost a small amount of charge. It can charge my Galaxy S7 Edge two times on a single charge. It weighs about the same as another unit I have with less than half the capacity. *And* it provides a fast charge. It takes only about an hour to charge my phone from 15%. All for a very reasonable cost!",2
5.0,,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"I've had this for several months now and have had no problems. It's perfect for my phone on the go since my phone's battery drains dramatically in the cold weather...The only thing I've noticed once or twice- If my phone dies completely before I plug it in to this, sometimes it doesn't have the capability turn it back on/charge, if that makes sense.",0
5.0,,"August 17, 2016",Yes,"I REALLY like this battery..I think that there are newer versions of this on the market, but this is the one that I have and it works great.  Small with extremely dense power capacity.  I can re-charge a galaxy S4 at least twice with it, probably closer to 3.5 times but I have never needed to be away from a plug for that long...Comes with a really convenient net pouch that holds the battery and a small charging cable.  I have actually added a Anker plug in folding pin travel charger and it fits in the bag too.",0
3.0,,"December 4, 2017",Yes,The inability to charge the battery pack while using it is disappointing. I saw references that this is by design. Either way that's a problem for me. It seems to work well otherwise and the capacity is impressive from my limited testing.,1
4.0,,"May 4, 2018",Yes,It's a little too big and heavy for me. I had a nice jackery charger that was perfect for your pocket. But I wanted to try this one that's the only reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 and if you have by the case it's too bulky to put in the jacket or pocket you need a bag. That's my only complaint.,0
5.0,,"March 14, 2016",Yes,"I bought this because of the vast amount of positive reviews. This is the first battery pack I've ever purchased other than Mophies. With me owning a 6+ I figured the Mophie would be too big so this is obviously the next best solution. I am in awe of how well the Anker battery pack works. It's extremely small yet it still retains an insane amount of juice. I've charged two phones on it with ease (not at the same time, of course). It still had more juice to charge more, however I threw it on the charger seeing as I was done with it. Furthermore, you can tell it's a quality product because it's heavy (in a good way). It feels like it's not some cheap P.O.S. Not to mention I got an email from Anker regarding a 18 month warranty so that's fantastic. My biggest let down with the product didn't actually come from the battery pack but the cheap 8in lighting bolt cord I was hoping to use with it. That broke in three days LOL. I will undoubtedly be buying from Anker in the future. Their products are great and I already have a friend buying the same battery pack as myself.",1
5.0,,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"As a college student, having portable power to charge phones or other small devices is incredibly important. I had the Anker PowerCore throughout my entire school year, and it consistently charged my phone three full cycles before it needed to be recharged. The rate of charging is also a bonus, as the Anker can recharge my phone just as fast as a standard outlet could. The unit itself is small and light, and can easily be taken on the go. Overall, this Anker power bank is a solid product for those looking to save their battery when away from an outlet.",1
5.0,,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"But I had to write one for this, because I was so impressed. I went out of town and forgot my regular charger. I just happened to have this battery fully charged in my purse... but I didn’t have the charging cord for this either. This battery lasted me 4 DAYS charging mine and my husbands phones (and we’re both on them quite a bit). It died on day 4, when we were on our way home. I am seriously impressed, and thought I’d share.",0
5.0,,"January 28, 2019",Yes,"I used to have a charging iPhone case, but there aren't really any great ones for the price for an iPhone 8. I decided to buy this instead and have not been disappointed. It charged itself quickly, and also charges my iPhone in record time. I wish it had pass-through charging, but the battery pack holds enough juice not to worry about having to charge it frequently.",0
5.0,,"December 27, 2016",Yes,"If you are on the go for extended periods of time, stop buying those small power packs. It was wonderful to have portable power when I needed it, however, the small packs would only charge my iPhone 6s Plus once.  I never really had enough juice on long flights and layovers. I have used the Anker powercore to charge my phone now four times, and I still have three lights illuminated on the powercore.  Plus the powercore has three outputs!  You could charge a whole families devices at one time.",0
5.0,,"June 11, 2018",Yes,This has been one of the best external batteries I've ever used. I bought it on a recommendation from a friend who raved about hers and how she could get multiple full charges out of it for her phone. It is now the only external charger I use and carry with me everywhere. I now never worry about my phone being dead. Yay!,0
5.0,,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"Whenever I need an electronic accessory I always go to Anker products first. So naturally when I wanted an external battery for camping and daily use, I chose the Anker PowerCore 10000. I chose this battery specifically for size as well as capacity. For me, it was the perfect solution to what I needed. Whenever I go to school or go into the wilderness, I throw this in my backpack and never worry about my phone dying away from home again. I could not recommend this, or any other Anker product, enough.",0
5.0,,"November 23, 2016",Yes,Bought this to replace a smaller Anker battery for use on my bike and as daily back up.  Works really well. Comes with a mesh bag that I hang on my handle bars and use a short cable to keep my phone plugged in for GPS.  Great set up and nice balance  of weight and power.  I carry it everyday now as well. It puts a full charge on my phone in a half hour.,1
5.0,,"June 26, 2018",Yes,"This little battery packs quite the punch! It usually lasts for 3 full dead-to-100% charges on my phone, and can sometimes last even longer than that. It has become an absolute essential, and is so small and easy to use. I carry it around with me constantly. In fact, I'm using it as I type this. After 6 months, it's still going strong, and I have no regrets at all about this purchase.",0
5.0,,"September 13, 2018",Yes,I love their chargers but their charging cables have an issue where their connecting tips go bad quicker than other brands.,1
5.0,,"January 26, 2019",Yes,"I needed a portable charger for vacation, and decided to get this one. I have used Anker in the past and have heard good things about it. It came with the charger, a little bag, a micro usb cable. I've been using it everyday for the past two weeks. It is super lightweight, tells me the current charge and fits perfectly in my pocket. I was able to charge my phone approximately 3 times before the charge went out. I plugged it in over night and it was good in the morning. Although, I have used bigger power banks in the past, for it's size this one gets the job done.",0
5.0,,"January 12, 2018",Yes,I have three of these now and all three have been phenomenal at quickly charging phones multiple times. They don't seem to mind temperatures either. I usually keep it in my vehicle and it works hot or cold. Discharge over time is also negligible as I've never noticed one that I had sitting charged lose even a single light on the bar graph.,0
4.0,,"January 28, 2018",Yes,Bought end of 2016. Charges up your devices but loses juice after about 6 months of use. Went from being able to charge my phone 4 times fully before needing a recharge to 1.5 times and takes a long time to fully charge it. Sometimes charging it over night doesn’t give it a full charge. I used to use it every day but now I just keep it in my glove box for emergencies since I don’t have a car charger and it works for whenever I need it.,0
5.0,,"February 14, 2018",Yes,I have been though so many external batteries that just done seem to charge well but this one exceeded expectations. Not only did it charge properly but I got like 4 full phone charges out of it. Brought it on my trip to Iceland and was there for 8 days and one full charge on the external last me the whole time. So impressed!,0
5.0,,"April 9, 2017",Yes,"This charger is great. It arrived with enough charge in it to charge my phone. I left the house with 52% battery, plugged it into the charger, in less than 30 minutes it had fully charged. I've used many portable charger and that is much faster than any of the others I have tried. Haven't had it out and about to try multiple charges or really test how long it stays charged. So far, I'm very happy with it.",0
4.0,,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"Had issues with it from the start. Charged it and somehow was able to get it to work once. Left it alone for a while and when I tried to use it again it doesn't respond at all. The middle two lights blink four times when I plug it in...Edit: Anker support team sent a replacement unit and so far it seems to work well. The behavior is noticeably different and much easier to use, so I can only assume the first was defective.",0
5.0,,"December 16, 2018",Yes,I kid you not I had expected very little from this thing when I bought it just for $30 only to have my expectations blown way out of proportion I leave it to charge over night and it manages to charge my s8 plus fully 2x with battery still to spare for my friends I'd suggest getting one of these guys as soon as possible of you're in need of a good quality charge at an amazing price and I'm seriously considering buying another as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend this thing was seriously worth the wait.,0
5.0,,"September 11, 2017",Yes,I ordered this before the hurricane and I can honestly say that this is the absolute best charger ever! I've had many power banks in the past and this one is so fast and has powered my iPhone many times! I definitely recommend this!!!!,2
5.0,,"May 4, 2018",Yes,"Just used this multiple times on a recent trip. It charged phones and tablet quickly. Just recharge the battery and it's ready to go again. Batteries are usually made of dense material and not light--this one is no different. It weighs about 1/2 lb, but fits easily in your hand--conveniently compact.",0
5.0,,"July 27, 2018",Yes,"This tho g is great. I don’t often need a portable battery, but I was Recently traveling across the country and wanted to make sure I always had my cell charged since I would Need it for navigation and looking up places to go and such. I have since just started using it around the house because I am Pretty sure it charges faster than the wall outlet! I use It to charge my phone, my wireless headphones, my nook. Everything. It holds several charges so you don’t have to worry about running out of juice if you are out and about and need to charge several things. I would Definitely recommend this to anyone!",0
5.0,,"September 11, 2017",Yes,"This is like the perfect power bank to have on you for a trip or on the go. The size of the power bank is very small,similar to the size of a bar of soap. It doesn't get in way when I carry it with me to class. I bought a multi-USB cable with this power bank, which easily let me charge like 3 device(s6,idol4,iphone 6) to max capacity with charge left in the power bank.",0
5.0,,"May 27, 2018",Yes,"very good product, charges phone well, havent used it very long, so time will tell. Had another charger from a different maker  and lost the power cable wasnt unable to charge device call customer support 3 time and never repy, poor service I hope Anker customer service is better.",0
4.0,,"June 6, 2016",Yes,"I do like it, but maybe I am doing something wrong because it doesn't always charge my iphone...  It has charged it only twice... All the other times it won't charge it.  And it still has 3 blue little lights lit up.  So I know it still has enough power to charge it.  If anyone can tell me, maybe I am doing something wrong when I try to charge it.  Other then that I like it...",1
3.0,,"January 21, 2019",Yes,"Awesome product! Works like it should, and lasts a very long time depending on what you charge. Phones usually charge 3-4 solid times off each full charge of this device. Takes a while to fully charge it, but I would guess that’s simply because it has such a strong battery in it! 3 stars is only because you can’t charge an item while it is getting charged. Not a big deal, but would make it so much more convenient.",0
5.0,,"June 9, 2018",Yes,"It was an awesome charger till about a week ago, now it only very slowly charges:-(..5 days later I received another one and it works great I hope it last me a long time. I'm very satisfied with the company service. Now I give them 5 star because they deserve it.",0
4.0,,"March 25, 2017",Yes,"This charges my iPhone quickly and completely 3x before needing to be charged.  I would give 5 stars, but it requires two cords - one for charging and one for my iPhone. And it must be charged from another charger or through my laptop.  Otherwise it is very good for such a small size.",1
5.0,,"September 20, 2018",Yes,I took this on a trip with me and it holds a charge and transfers a charge wonderfully. It's small and doesn't weigh much so it's easily carried in a purse. The only complaint is that the chord that comes with it is only a few inches long and is way to short. Isn't that a problem any time?,0
5.0,,"March 6, 2019",Yes,"I got this for a trip to Massachusetts last summer as well as to use through college, and I am so glad I made this investment. It does take a while to charge, but you get what you put in it. It does have some weight, but it is SO durable. I've dropped it quite a few times rushing to class, and it still works great.",1
5.0,,"August 20, 2018",Yes,I have a few products from this company and have no complaints.  I got this charger about a year ago and had no issues.  One day I was not able to charge it.  I contacted customer service and they were so helpful with replacing the charger.  It certainly encouraged me to want to continue buying products from them in the future.,0
2.0,,"December 23, 2018",Yes,"The only reason I bought this was as a kind of APS for a raspberry pi. I wanted to keep it permanently connected to a power supply and the raspberry pi, but it turns out that it can only charge either itself or provide power for the raspberry pi at the same time. That is a bummer, because the other Anker power supplies I bought CAN do this.",0
5.0,,"August 26, 2016",Yes,"I took this charger on a 7-day backpacking trip in the Sierras.  We were totally off the grid but I wanted to be able to charge my iPhone (used as a camera) and iPad (for reading and accessing a map).  The PowerCore 10000 charged up my iPhone twice, my daughter's once, and the iPad once, and we still had 2 of 4 bars showing on the battery.  Easy to use and charges fast.  Great charger.",1
5.0,,"November 10, 2018",Yes,This thing is amazing. The best extra better created!! I was studying abroad the whole summer and took this everywhere with me. It would stay charged through 4-6 charges sometimes I would plug my phone into it instead of the wall overnight and it would still have battery for the rest of the day! Impressive battery life and very high quality!,0
5.0,,"March 28, 2017",Yes,"If, like me, you need your Zelda/Nintendo Switch fix on the go, this is what you'll want...Yes, yes, there are larger powerbanks out there, but quite honestly - this is giving me near six hours EXTRA battery life, for a total of NINE hours of Zelda on the go when you factor in the Switch's own battery proving three of those hours...Perfect...I love that this thing only weighs 180 grams, too, so it's easily thrown into a jacket pocket or bag, without any weight headaches. I coupled it with the <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Cable-Matters-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-Type-A-USB-A-Cable-with-Braided-Jacket-in-Black-3-3-Feet/dp/B018X3IMDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cable Matters USB Type C (USB-C) to Type A (USB-A) Cable with Braided Jacket in Black 3.3 Feet</a>, and I couldn't be happier...5 stars out of 5. Excellent!",13
5.0,,"December 23, 2016",Yes,"I thought this battery pack was great upon first receiving it, but within a few uses the cable they included no longer works to charge my phone. The battery still works and charges my phone quickly, but I cannot give a good review when the full product doesn't work as expected...Update- Anker reached out to me and immediately replaced the cord that had failed. The battery pack is still working well and I recommend this product and company. Changed rating to 5 stars.",2
5.0,,"January 5, 2018",Yes,"This thing is actually a lot smaller than I was expecting. The 10,000 mah is plenty for keeping my phone charged throughout the day (maybe even more than a day, though I haven't tried it). It feels heavy and well built, and I really like the pouch it came with. The cable works fine too, but I would recommend getting a longer one, or whatever fits your needs.",0
5.0,,"July 16, 2018",Yes,I love this thing! I carry it in my bag all the time! It was great when my wife and I went to Europe this summer. We were able to charge both of our iPhones twice with only charging it once! Never going back to anything that isnt anker again!,1
5.0,,"December 9, 2017",Yes,"Make sure you insert the plug all the way in when you charge it.  The charging lights flicker as it's charging.  Out of the box, it took about six hours to fully charge  it.  Lightweight.  Love the color!  I'm going to a group camping event where we often share power strips... and wanted to make sure my charger was easy to spot amidst all the black ones!",1
5.0,,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"This sucker has saved me numerous times especially while overseas for two months. I need a new battery for my phone, but I am holding out for a new iPhone, and this guy saved me countless times. Very compact, doesn't get overheated when plugged in, and charges up quickly, and also my phone quickly. Only has one port for connecting, so if you have other things to charge, I would recommend something else. But if you are only charging a cell phone, this is perfect.",0
5.0,,"October 29, 2018",Yes,"Love this power brick! Super small and easy to carry, fits comfortably in my small backpack purse without taking up too much room, and holds a charge foreverrrrr. Also comes with a nifty little mesh carrying bag, which I stick a lightning cable and an extra pair of headphones in. The color is cute too! The red is a nice cherry color that's not too loud and makes it easy to find in the dark abyss that is my bag. Would definitely recommend this product.",0
5.0,,"February 13, 2017",Yes,"Absolutely, hands-down, the best battery charger/power cells I have. This little sucker charges up over night, and it will give me 3 full phone charges, and the nice thing is. I plug my phone into it while it's in my purse and 20 mins later I have at least 20% more power. its really fast at fully charging my phone. Sometimes, I use it only because it seems faster than my wall charger!? Maybe I need a new wall charger..",0
5.0,,"May 29, 2017",Yes,"Now that my wife has had time to use it for about 6 months.  She initially thought it was something she would never use. Now she will not leave home without it. It fits perfectly in her small travel purse. It is the perfect size, not too heavy, with one usb plug. It will charge her Samsung galaxy s7 edge 3 times and still have a little extra. It charges quickly and is an all around great product.",0
5.0,,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"I have been using the PowerCore 10000 charger for 2+ years and it continues to be my go-to external battery pack. The pack is built well, chargers devices quickly, and has seen little to no degradation after regular use. The size is also perfect for slipping into a backpack or jacket pocket. The only potential issue is the charging input. I wish it were USB-C, but no big deal.",1
5.0,,"September 21, 2018",Yes,"I called Anker because my product was not working a few days after I purchased it. I called Anker after 30 days because I was on vacation and they are sending me a brand new one for free. The lady over the phone was amazing, she was so kind, helpful and patient. Very excellent customer service. I have had previous batteries from Anker and I have never had a problem. Probably just a one time thing. Anyway nobodies perfect and its always nice to see companies who understand that and really own it by offering great customer service. Very satisfied.",0
5.0,,"June 3, 2018",Yes,"Bought two of these to use on our trip to Hawaii.  Unfortunately, this trip was cancelled due to the volcano eruptions, but we still expect to use these during power outages and trips.  Charging went well and they really seem to charge quickly attached to an Anker multi-station USB charger we already had.",0
5.0,,"January 15, 2018",Yes,"I've had this charger for six months now, and really like it. I mainly use it for road trips or on a plane, and have found that it holds a charge fairly well, and has been easy to use and understand. There is a light reading that shows its current charge, and it has been fully compatible with my iPhone. I've had no issues, and have found it to be a very worthwhile investment.",0
5.0,,"June 13, 2016",Yes,"I bought this about 2 weeks ago and received it about 4 days ago.  So far this thing has been fantastic.  I have been able to charge by device from a starting point of 25 to 40 percent multiple times in a day on one single charge from this little device.  I own multiple battery banks ranging from 3000mah up tp 5600mah.  Some specifically designed for Qualcomm QC 2.0 and this very compact little charger charges every bit as fast with MAHs to spare.  I would highly recommend this battery pack at around $20 to $25, you won't regret it.",0
5.0,,"August 31, 2017",Yes,"Great product, keeps charge longer than other portable chargers I've had, only wish more than one device could be charged at once, but still extremely happy with my purchase...kept phone charged all day no matter how many pictures or videos I took, and could usually charge for a few days before needing to plug it in again.  Also loved how cord is reversible to charge phone or be charged, depending on need.",0
4.0,,"January 8, 2019",Yes,"After watching my battery take 2 days to recharge, I did some research and apparently need a specialized charger for this battery. Shelled out another $20. The charger was not included with this, and it should have been. Otherwise a good product. Looking forward to using a proper Anker charger on this and getting better recharge times.",0
5.0,,"January 11, 2019",Yes,"Love these batteries, been using them for the past couple years to power my devices during long days at conventions. They never fail and have enough juice to get me thru the long day for my phone and my tablet",0
5.0,,"June 18, 2018",Yes,"This is the 3rd one of these Anker Battery packs we've bought. They are amazing. Proved to be life saver at NYC when we were using our devices non-stop for navigation my LG V20 phone battery was draining by noon, but one Anker Power Core 10000 kept it fully charge and going all day long. Very small and compact, and incredibly reliable.",1
5.0,,"September 13, 2018",Yes,"This company is by far one of the best companies to buy electronic supplies from. They will work, time and time again. They will not break on you like their cheap counterparts. This little batter keeps on chugging. I gave it one less star because it is not that huge of a battery but can get you through the day charging your devices. Now if you want one that has life look at their 21k. With this the size is what is super nice because it is very small but it is so much more than sufficient. Could not recommend it more. Buy with no worries. Enjoy and stay charged.",0
5.0,,"May 6, 2018",Yes,"I experienced a recharging issue with my Anker PowerCore 10000, and subsequently wrote an unsatisfactory Amazon product review.  The very next day, I received an email from Sharon, AnkerDirect  Customer Support, who apologized for any inconvenience and offered some work-arounds to resolve the issue.  Additionally, she informed me that my battery was covered by an 18 month warranty and a replacement was being shipped to me..The replacement battery has arrived and is working perfectly..I cannot begin to say how satisfied I am with Anker’s Customer Satisfaction Team.  Anker stands behind their product and their communication is excellent.",0
5.0,,"April 24, 2017",Yes,"I have had this product for months now and it never fails me. I travel a lot and always keep this powerbank close to me in cases of emergency. I do, however dislike the black cloth it came with it. My coworker who ordered the same product in Amazon got a nice looking sleeve instead of the black string pouch that I got. Nonetheless, we both attested to how this anker powerbank works wonderfully for us.",0
5.0,,"February 2, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for myself, but my daughter has it all the time so it must work very well.  It's small and easy to charge.  Great thing to have while traveling. Nothing but good things to say about it.",1
5.0,,"May 24, 2016",Yes,"Anker once again knocks it out of the park with this portable battery.  I'm always on the hunt for the perfect external battery.  Each have their strong points, and suit certain situations better than others.  This release, the 10000 PowerCore is ideal for portability and weight.  Coming from their 13400 aluminum offering (which is also great, in its own right), and I thought the devices would be similarly sized.  They are not.  This 10000 unit is literally just about the size of a pack of cigarettes.  Weighing about the same.  It's almost deceptively lightweight.  I would have expected much more just picking it up...Thanks to its ideal size, this will go just about everywhere with me.  I would like to have the QC 3.0 offered in the new model, but is it really worth the $12 premium.  Time will tell on how long this takes to charge my phone.  Updates will follow if any issues are encountered.",0
5.0,,"August 19, 2018",Yes,"I actually really liked the product, good power density, charged phone amazingly fast, etc. But the battery stopped charging up after only a few uses so none of that really matters anymore...UPDATE: Customer service is amazing for Anker. They apologized for the defect and quickly mailed me a new one which is working perfectly.",0
5.0,,"July 31, 2017",Yes,"I love my Anker PowerCore so much! It is seriously such a great product! I originally bought it to use at Disneyland, but I have actually ended up using it everywhere and all of the time. It was fantastic to use at Disneyland but now I also love to use it when I'm studying at coffee shops or at school, on long drives out of state, and even when I'm just relaxing on the couch. It has honestly saved me a couple times and also made my life easier!",1
5.0,,"December 16, 2018",Yes,Charged my iPhone 8 from 0 to 80 very fast and didn't even lose 25%. Very pleased. I bought this smaller one because I am never away from power for longer than a day or two at the most so this is more than I need.,0
5.0,,"June 30, 2018",Yes,"It's an Anker product, it's undoubtedly perfect. It doesn't appear to loose charge even when left alone for an extended period of time. It takes a while to charge as expected and it has as much power as advertised. It's a small size compared to most 10000 mAh power banks, yet a much higher quality. If you're looking for a high quality battery which lasts for a few phone charges at a fair price with a good size. This is the power bank for you.",0
5.0,,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"I'm impressed how many charges this holds. I took it on vacation and charged my phone a couple times and it still registered at full capacity. Even now after a few weeks back from my trip, the charger status still says it's at full power. If it's correct and not giving a false reading, that's quite nice",0
5.0,,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"Some chargers are thin and good looking but don't work for long.  This one does in spite of teenager traffic.  It's small and can be carried along in a backpack, purse or pocket and is ready for use.  After a year it's still working well.",0
5.0,,"April 15, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for my friend, then one for my cousin, then one for my wife, and then my cousin bought me one. This is an awesome and must have product. The unit itself doesn’t charge too quickly (because it holds about 2.5 phone charges) but charges your phone like lightning McQueen, kachow!",0
5.0,,"July 19, 2018",Yes,This is a great product for on the go. Also if there was an emergency you could use it for power outage. It charged my iphone 6s 6 plus times.,1
5.0,,"January 4, 2017",Yes,"Researched a lot of portable chargers.  Settled on the Anker PowerCore 10000, based on reviews here.  Well, it arrived, it charged.up quickly, and it BLEW our minds !  Charges up our phones much faster than charging into a typical outlet.  We took it with us to.Europe where family lives.  They have their own portable chargers there, but asked to borrow the Anker - again, they were floored at.the speed with which it charges, and its capacity to do this, many times over.  They loved it so much, we left it with them, and I am.just about to order another for myself here.",0
5.0,,"December 6, 2018",Yes,This is a phenomenal little power bank. I love that this is small enough to conveniently carry in my purse or backpack wherever I go. It holds up to 2 or 3 charges for my phone and other devices. I love this thing,0
5.0,,"November 24, 2016",Yes,"I'm a guide for a non-profit organization that takes disabled veterans hunting, I constantly use my phone to stay in contact with everyone. I don't always have a chance to recharge my phone during the day and this device has really met and surpassed my expectations. My phone is charged quickly and can several times. The price was great and shipping with Amazon Prime was on time and fast. I highly recommend this to everyone.",0
4.0,,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"Overall this battery pack probably works fine for most people.  It's good quality, the LED charge indicator is nice, and it has USB and HDMI ports...The only reason I'm knocking a start off of this is because I was hoping to use this battery pack to charge my Lenovo Carbon X1 5th generation laptop; however, it doesn't seem to work for some reason.  From what I'm reading online (yea, I know, super reliable source), it sounds like I need a battery with ""PD"" such as the Anker PowerCore+ 26800 PD; however, I haven't tried this yet.  This thing works fine for phones or other small peripheral devices and has a good amount of capacity.",0
5.0,,"January 16, 2019",Yes,"This charger is so great. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. It charges my phone very fast even while I'm using it and have battery draining apps running. I have a galaxy S8 and this charger will fully charge it about 3 times. Same goes for use on my tablet. The portable charger itself take some time to charge, maybe like 5 hrs? But definitely worth it. Would totally recommend.",0
5.0,,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"This power bank worked flawlessly for well over a year. Recently, a piece that allowed the charger to connect broke. I emailed anker support and they quickly sent out a brand new replacement. Excellent customer service and a great product. Would buy again!",0
5.0,,"September 7, 2018",Yes,After my previous powerbank decided to stop working I needed a new and reliable one. My hubby has had the larger Anker for about 2 years now and it works wonderfully. I needed something smaller though and this works great. I have had no issues. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a reliable power bank that is also small enough to fit in a pocket.,0
5.0,,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"Perfect for traveling. I got about 2.5-3 full iPhone 7 charges on this power bank before having to recharge the power bank. It does take a long time to charge the power bank, so just charge it while you sleep. I traveled Asia for a month and this was so useful.",0
5.0,,"December 22, 2016",Yes,"This is the best small portable charger around.  It comes with a nice bag to keep it in.  I keep the micro USB charger in the pouch and have a 3"" lightning cord sticking out of the top.  It's super portable and light.  I haven't had any issues with this charger.  It charges itself quickly and charges devices quickly.  It packs a powerful punch in its small size.",1
5.0,,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"I am thrilled to have a very small, but efficient source of power to use when my 6 year old has used all the power in my phone and I need power in a hurry.  I can place the power bank in my purse along with my phone and charge it wherever I am.  I do not have to search for a plug-in.  I absolutely love this.  I will be using it to charge his I-pad on long trips.  It will be so much efficient and easier to plug in rather than stretching the cord from the power source in the car.  If need be, I can use the charger in the car as a back up if I need to charge two things at once.  Love it!!!!!",0
1.0,,"December 31, 2017",Yes,This battery was great for a month or two but while I was traveling it mysteriously stopped working. It will not hold a charge. Aside form this problem the product is good.,2
5.0,,"April 10, 2019",Yes,This little charger works perfectly. Kept two phones charged during 18 hour Disneyland adventure. It is a little heavy for carrying around in a pocket but fits conveniently in purse wear weight is not an issue.,0
5.0,,"April 10, 2018",Yes,"I bought this power bank for a trip abroad. TSA will let you bring it through security, so that's a big plus obviously. It charges up pretty slow, but I charge it overnight from dead and it's always charged fully when I wake up. It charges devices quite quickly if you aren't doing anything that drains your battery a ton while charging. I have an iPhone 7 Plus and I get about 3 full charges from it, sometimes 4 if I don't mess with my phone while it's charging. It has been my best friend on my travels abroad and I have been able to count on it every single day so far. Very happy customer and I will be buying another when this one craps out.",0
5.0,,"November 8, 2018",Yes,I bought this for a smaller option to charge my phone on the go. It is fabulous for the speed of charging. I’m writing this as I’ve been on the my phone nonstop riding to the airport. I am at 94% from 10 during the 50 minute ride while using my phone the entitre time. I compare this to the charger I plug into my computer while I’m at work that barely charges a few percent over many hours. I love the size of this and the effectiveness in giving a great charge. Definitely recommend!,0
5.0,,"July 31, 2018",Yes,"I've got 2 of these now because I'd thought I lost my old one, but I'm pleased to have two on hand. This went with me all over Europe and now goes with me on nights out in my purse to make sure I've always got power to order an Uber home :)",0
5.0,,"December 23, 2018",Yes,"Using this daily on a European trip from the US. No issues going through security. Charged our camera, Bose headphones and three iPhones at will. Love this!",1
5.0,,"October 16, 2016",Yes,"I'm pretty much an Anker fanboy now. This is my second battery from them (other is a lipstick model). This one works just as well as that one. I had a slight reservation because the battery level indicator seems to be telling me that this was draining faster than it should have, but in actual practice it lasted as long as it should for it's mAh rating. I'd recommend this or pretty much any other Anker product.",0
4.0,,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"I've been using this for about 2 months and and it seems to be working OK.  It's a small portable unit that you can easily carry in your pocket (though it might feel a little heavy).  It takes a little bit of time to re-charge but that's to be expected.  It charges my phone up pretty quickly, and it holds its charge for a long time when not in use.  Still $26.00 for a 10,000 mAh charger with one USB port seems too much.  Should be under $20.00 for lack of a 2nd USB port.",0
4.0,,"June 13, 2018",Yes,"Love, love, love this thing! It fully charges both of our two phones without having to be recharged itself. Only sad thing is, it's not compatible with our new Google Pixel 2s, so we need to find an adapter cord. Not a big deal, just an inconvenience.",0
5.0,,"June 30, 2018",Yes,I work 10 hour shifts and the only thing that helps pass the time is listening to music. By the end of the day my phone would die. Yesterday I came home from work only slept one hour and was completely drained. Without thinking I take my phone out of my right pocket and walk right in the pool too cool off. Completely submerged in water for about ten seconds in my left pocket was the portable charger. I was sure it was broken I sat it in the sun and went on with my day. I sit here at work the next day writing this review while charging my phone with that same charger. Completely shocked and amazed it seems to work perfectly,0
5.0,,"May 6, 2018",Yes,"this thing is perfect size and loaded with power. it would have been nice if it came with multi ended cable, like lightning, usb c, and micro usb. i was able to charge my bluetooth headset, my note 5 phone, and my camera batteries with it on an extended trip.",0
5.0,,"March 2, 2019",Yes,I bought this product for my husband since his phone is always dead or at 3% because he never charges it or some other reason. I did charge the product for like 5 hours before use. He absolutely loves this thing! I got him the red one and it’s so nice looking and charged his dead phone within 15-20 minutes. He was very surprised and very happy! I highly recommend and so does he! Amazing product! I need a white one for myself now 🤗,0
5.0,,"May 3, 2018",Yes,AWESOME! Carry like wallet. Big Blue Box Store sold for more with 1.3 charges. This does nearly 3X iPhone charges. My wife can yell at me for hours and not consume my energy. BUY!,1
5.0,,"January 8, 2017",Yes,"I love this charger! It is very compact and fits in my pocket easily. The nice protective sleeve it comes with is very nice to keep it from scratching against my keys. I haven't drained it to zero yet, but it's able to charge my iPhone6s at least 3 times on a single charge from 20%. It's a great backup especially if you're playing Pokémon go because it's not as bulky as other ones I've seen with this much power. The charger that comes with it is 2 feet long",1
5.0,,"September 14, 2018",Yes,I love this charger so much! It charges my phone a lot faster then if I were to charge my phone in a wall outlet and I take it almost everywhere I go. My only complaint is that it takes forever to charge! I charge it overnight so I don't really have to deal with it taking forever but sometimes when I wake up after plugging it in around 10pm its still charging and not full....But other then that I still use this product and I've had it for about a year and a half now.,0
4.0,,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"The product is very lightweight and charges extremely fast.  It will charge my iphone 8 in half the speed it would take charging with a wall outlet.  The only thing I dislike about the product is how long it takes to charge itself.  I plug it in every day to have it fully charged for when I leave the home and it takes two-three hours to become fully charged.  Product definitely works well and is small and lightweight.  It fits in your pocket while charging your phone no problem, I just wish it could become fully charged quicker.  For $30 it is a good purchase.",0
5.0,,"July 29, 2018",Yes,"I keep this charged for any kind of unexpected charging, it holds enough for a couple charges, and works just like it says on the tin. My previous phone had some pretty dramatic battery problems, and this basically acted like its life support for two weeks on an international trip. Can't say enough good things.",0
2.0,,"December 5, 2017",Yes,Worked great but stopped working after 7 months.  Not worth buying!.Update..The company stood by their warrantee and sent me a new one.  So far so good. I will have to see if it lasts . I will keep you posted.,2
5.0,,"January 14, 2018",Yes,"We purchased this for our week-long family trip to Disney World.  We would not have survived the trip without it.  About half-way through the day, we started passing it around for everyone to get a quick charge.  I'd leave the charger in one pocket with a cable draping over to the pocket with my phone in it.",0
5.0,,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"Bought this almost a year ago and I'm even surprised how much I use it. Perfect size! At work conferences it's handy to recharge your phone without having to be ""that guy"" crouched by an outlet with a power cord. Also great for off the electric grid camping or hiking in between car charger opportunities. Will recharge my iPhone SE about 3 times.",0
4.0,,"May 14, 2018",Yes,"I really like the Anker PowerCore 1000.  It seems to charge the phone fairly quickly as well as charge the cell phone 1-3 times before the Power Core needs to be recharged again. It seems a little heavy for its size, but still am very satisfied.",0
5.0,,"December 4, 2017",Yes,"Ok, I’ve only had this for about a week, but I bought it right before I was scheduled to travel, so it’s already got some use. So far - I love it! The packaging was nice, it came with a convenient carry case for the device and its charging cord, and it didn’t take long to fully charge. I got several uses out of it before the device had to be charged, which saved me from wall-hugging during a 6-hour flight delay. I was so grateful to have this device! Not sure yet how well it will stand up over time, but my early review is satisfied.",0
5.0,,"June 19, 2018",Yes,"The original model I was sent was defective, however, Anker quickly sent me a new one at no cost, and the new model has served admirably, and has been dropped a few times and still works, showing sturdiness in my opinion. Remember however that this model is not designed for robustness, and to keep it safe from water and heights in the nice cushioned provided bag.",1
5.0,,"May 14, 2018",Yes,"I have a Samsung S7. When the Anker is fully charged it will recharge my phone at least 4 times. I use it on multi-day bicycle tours. I can charge my bike lights, my phone, my lantern, etc. and will get home days later and there is still charge left in the Anker.",0
5.0,,"September 29, 2017",Yes,Galaxy S8:.Plugged my phone in @ 7% battery..Took about 1hr 40min to charge to 100%.Used 1 blue status indicator light on the Anker. Three status lights still available for more charges.,1
5.0,,"February 11, 2019",Yes,I have the battery for a little over year and it worked great. It suddenly stopped Charing. I contacts anker and the customer service was great. They sent me replacement without any hassle. When it didn’t show and I contacted them again they immediately sent me a another no questions ask. Anker has great and helpful customer service.,1
5.0,,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"This is a super great power bank, it comes with a nice mesh pouches while she can keep your power bank and the cable together. It works very well does the job I normally get about to complete charges from it but that's really all I need since I use it when I'm out running or playing Pokemon go, it's amazing I totally recommend",0
5.0,,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"I was excited for this battery pack because the reviews i’ve read about it. I was very disappointed. The battery pack took 11 hours to charge full and I believe it has a malfunction. There are 4 lights to indicate the battery pack is full, but this one stops at 3/4 and it wont charge no more after that. I contacted them and they sent me a new one after the defects of the first one and it works perfect! It charges 4/4 when its full with 4 blue lights and it will stop when its fully charged. This charger gave me almost 5 full charges on heavy usage on my iphone 8",0
5.0,,"October 21, 2017",Yes,"Great product! With the life of an iPhone 6S battery when traveling I never leave home without it. I used to use an extended life slide on battery that made the phone feel as though I was carrying a brick. This works better, faster and much longer. Definitely the way to go as Anker makes excellent products.",0
1.0,,"March 19, 2019",Yes,"LESS than four months after purchase, and the battery pack NO LONGER WORKS.  Instead, there is a weird crunchy sound coming from it. This is really disappointing because I had enjoyed using it for the first month. After that, I hadn’t needed to use it till three months later, when it completely FAILED. The size is good and portable, but everything is useless if the battery pack stops working a few months in.",0
5.0,,"June 8, 2017",Yes,Very fast charger. I have an iPhone 7plus and the power bank can charge my phone from 0 to 100 for at least 2 to three times. The item is cute. Love it. Better than any other power banks I've ever had.,2
5.0,,"February 20, 2019",Yes,It's awesome. Has a long battery life. Very compact and lightweight. They use LG batteries which are the best batteries. I love how long it lasts.. how much I can charge with it without using a wall plug.,0
4.0,,"September 26, 2016",Yes,"Charges fairly fast. Charges my 5000mah battery 2+ times.  I may be expecting too much, but, I would like to see half the thickness and slightly lighter weight.  In the pocket it is not too obnoxiously big nor heavy. Very sturdy product, charging cord very well made. I did a bit of research and tried another product before the Anker.  Anker was recommended to me, but I was bargain hunting.  Waset of time.  This is a great product.",0
4.0,,"June 11, 2018",Yes,"Small size is nice. It helps not to keep USB plugged into the device when not using, otherwise when you connect it to your phone, it won't automatically charge and you must turn on power button. I did not realize this and found it inconvenient, expressing that here, and customer service contacted me to suggest the above. Ideally I would like to keep an extra USB plugged into the device at all times for convenience when I travel, but the solution is helpful! Customer service is responsive if issues arise.",0
5.0,,"August 8, 2018",Yes,"****Update****.After my review I was contacted by Anker and they replaced my battery pack right away. So far it is working well. Excellent customer service!..I was very happy with this product when I first purchased it in April, now in August it no longer holds a charge. My older model from Anker still works well and it over 3 years old, it's just bulky.",0
5.0,,"November 25, 2017",Yes,"I posted a review a month ago as I had an issue with the product. Anker Customer Service contacted me and asked me questions to help fix the issues. The customer service person was astounding! They went above and beyond in doing their job. They ended up sending me a new Anker, free of charge, since my old one stopped working shortly after I bought it. The new one has been working great and I haven't had any issues so far!.Thanks again for the great service!",0
4.0,,"February 8, 2019",Yes,"Update - The company returned my message and sent me a new battery. They have an 18 month warranty and they mean it!..Worked great initially. I did not have any issues for about 4 months but then when I went to use it again recently (there was a chunk of time I just didn't need it), it didn't work. I have tried multiple cords, plugs, electronics - nothing. It won't charge and it won't charge other things...The description says that it is under an 18 month warranty but I do not know how to exchange/return it.",0
5.0,,"February 2, 2018",Yes,"Really like this product, use it daily.  The unit charges quickly and it charges my smart phone very quickly, less than an hour or 20-minutes depending on battery level.  Very sleek and stylish.  The included case is stylish and useful, i keep the charger in there.  It's also very light weight.",0
5.0,,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"This battery pack has work great since day one. It is been over a year and still holds a great charge, I'm able to charge phones 3 or 4 times and I can also power USB powered lights. When camping I use a solar charger to recharge this during the day and I can have full battery the rest of the night",0
5.0,,"September 29, 2016",Yes,"This charger is amazing!  I have gotten several full charges out of it for my cell phone while on the go all day for work, or when my son plays Pokemon Go.  It is small and fits easily in my purse.  It's much smaller and lighter than my husband's portable charger, making it much more convenient to carry around.  It charges quickly and I like the little lights on the unit to show how much power it has.  I am glad I bought this!  It has saved me from a dead iPhone many times!",0
5.0,,"November 23, 2018",Yes,This was to be a replacement for my original battery bought over a year ago that fell out of my bag onto the roadway.  I found that original charger on that road hours later with bad road rash but still fully functional,0
5.0,,"November 7, 2016",Yes,"An amazing little charger! About the size of a deck of cards, though fairly heavy (it's a battery, so that's expected). Came with a cable that works with Samsung phones and Kindle Fire tablets. Battery holds charge for ages! I can fully charge my Galaxy s3 twice on this device. Can also be used with other USB cable devices (iphone/ipod, etc), but you need to supply your own cables.",0
4.0,,"July 23, 2018",Yes,"I have to say I was so disappointed when all of a sudden my PowerCore stopped working. We had used it at Disney World everyday for a week, let friends borrow it and used it on vacation .... then nothing. But this company is awesome. It stands behind its 18 month warranty and their customer service was so amazing.  I appreciate them taking care of my disappointment so rapidly and without any question. And Amazon customer service was awesome as always when I contacted them first to see how to handle this. Thank you Anker for your impeccable service.",0
5.0,,"December 20, 2018",Yes,"This is an incredible battery! I was able to charge my Note 8 from about 30% battery, to full charge several times and fairly quickly. So much better than all these bargain battery packs you see at stores and even some that are other familiar brands. Highly recommend!",0
5.0,,"February 4, 2019",Yes,"Exceeds my expectations. Bought this for it's size and capacity, needed a relatively high capacity pocket size charger. I have other Anker products, all, including this charger have been excellent!",0
5.0,,"June 3, 2017",Yes,"I have both this and the Powercore+. I specifically bought the Powercore+ the first time because it was the premium of the two. It boasts faster charging times and stronger materials. Buying off of Amazon, you don't get to see and feel the items. I thought I had lost my Powercore+ and ordered this one as a replacement thinking I didn't want to splurge on something I might misplace again. This one is WAYYY lighter than the other model. I've always considered light-weight to be a premium with electronics so the weight and price difference through me for a loop. Lighter and cheaper? I have a small EDC bag and weight is extremely important to me. The last thing I want is my EDC bag to be too cumbersome. A++",0
2.0,,"January 1, 2019",Yes,"Slow charging. Really slow. After full depletion, it takes 24 hours or more to fully charge.",1
5.0,,"July 24, 2018",Yes,Charged my phone four times on this battery. We were camping and I use my phone as a camera. Worked like magic.,1
5.0,,"August 2, 2018",Yes,"Been using this bad boy for a couple of months, and it charges quick! Not only that but anker products are superior with their quality, this power bank has been dropped, and works just fine. Charge it once, and forget about it? Don’t worry, he’s still able to charge your electronics quick and still be ready for the next one.",0
5.0,,"February 18, 2017",Yes,"My wife wanted something to charge her phone and Ipad, which she uses constantly.  After checking reviews and looking at different products, we decided on this one.  We are not disappointed.  She can charge her phone AND Ipad and still have plenty of battery power left.  She carries it in her purse all the time.  It's a bit heavier than I thought it would be but certainly not a problem.",0
4.0,,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"I have only used this charger about five times since receiving it two months ago. However, it took at least 36 hours to fully charge and its ""full"" charge is only about 75% (3 of the 4 dots light up)...Edit: The company reached out to me directly to send me a replacement and the new charger seems to be working fine. With use it seems like recharging takes longer, but not excessive like the previous unit received.",1
5.0,,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"I had heard good things about this power bank, and it has lived up to those promises thus far. The packaging was minimal - so less packaging (points for being eco friendly) which was aesthetically pleasing. The product itself took about 4-5 hours to fully charge, which makes sense as it's supposed to be able to charge a phone multiple times. It charged my phone at least as fast, if not faster than, my regular charger. It also did not get hot while charging itself or my phone. Very pleased customer over here.",0
3.0,,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"After receiving promptly, I opened package to find all that was ordered. The instruction pamphlet had the smallest imaginable print and not in English. A youtube tutorial solved the questions I had. I have not yet used for iphone but the battery went from full to half in less than an hour recharging my Ipad. Jury is still out",0
5.0,,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"Pros:.No frills, lightest and smallest 10,000 battery bank I can find..Works reliably..Indicator lights will tell you the amount of charge remaining...Cons:.Will not charge an ear bud or other items that require a lower current..No frills and not sexy looking",0
5.0,,"September 14, 2016",Yes,"I do recommend it for everyone. It is the best charger I have ever tried. I have bought two others. However, this is the best for two reasons...First , It size is comfortable that you can carry it easily. Is super tiny compering to other chargers...Second, it charge my Iphone 4 to 5 times. I have not charger my phone with any thing als snice I bought it...Third, it did not damage my Iphone poetry. This is the first portable chager that did not damege my iphone portray...Notes; the charger itself needs to be charge at least 5 Hours to by full...Though I like it. It is the beat ever.",0
5.0,,"December 21, 2018",Yes,"The perfect gift for birthday, wedding (2 of them...), stocking stuffer, etc.  I don't leave home without it.  So small!  Big performance! Haven't tested with my iPad yet.  I'm sure it won't recharge it more than 40% but that's great if needed.  I'll update this review in the future.",0
2.0,,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"This battery may be great for charging phones, but it will NOT keep a Nintendo Switch fully charged while running. I had hoped it would because of the weight. It's nice and well built but you need a PD charging battery for the Switch. I gave it to a friend.",0
5.0,,"July 19, 2017",Yes,"This charger is everything I hoped for and more! Charges my iPad to a full charge quickly, even while I am using the iPad. Small and relatively lightweight. You will need to add your own lightening cable if you are using an iPhone or iPad, which is one thing that would have been a nice inclusion, but nevertheless, this is a great product!",0
5.0,,"October 13, 2017",Yes,"I bought this for a recent trip were I would be using my phone a lot.  This charged my phone and my husband's multiple times.  And it is fast!  My father recently was hospitalized and my step mom forgot her charger.  I gave her this to use.  She loved it so much, I now have to buy a new one for me!",0
5.0,,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"I wish it had the built in cables, but this charger has been great for us.  Me, my daughter and her friends are always using it and passing it around as soon as one of us has enough charge to let someone else use it.  It charges our phones quickly and is very reliable.",0
5.0,,"March 28, 2017",Yes,I was very surprised by this product! I was able to charge my phone completely twice using a single charge of this external battery. The design is small enough to fit in your pocket in case you are traveling and expecting to you use your phone heavily. I would debate that a larger battery from Anker would be overkill - this battery completely met my needs.,0
5.0,,"December 22, 2016",Yes,"I  foolishly bought ONE of these for myself to combat a quick-draining battery. Son immediately borrowed...and lost...but not before everyone coveted it. Christmas this year will be Powercores for everyone.  Not just great for dying phones, i used it on vacation to read and recharge my tablet without needing to sit right next to an outlet. Always happy with Anker products",0
4.0,,"April 14, 2019",Yes,"Small, light enough to carry in cargo pocket for my kids, when they forget to charge their tech before leaving home. Would be nice if it had 2 USB ports, but understand cost is a factor.",0
5.0,,"July 2, 2017",Yes,"I don't know how I ever lived without one of these!! These are a PHONE SAVER. I work from home after having a baby and I use a bluetooth earpiece with the phone. And I'm always moving around the house taking calls, tending to baby, cleaning in between, etc. I find it hard to just leave my phone near an outlet to let it charge so this little device literally changed my life. It does take a bit to charge completely, but it's more than enough for people who need to constantly recharge their phones.",0
5.0,,"February 7, 2019",Yes,"This is a great power bank. Pretty compact and charges my phone like 3 times. Works exactly as advertised, have taken it on a few rigorous days out and dropped it a few times and it still works great. Very recommended!",0
5.0,,"November 26, 2016",Yes,"After having this for a few months, I have to admit that I don't think I can live without it. It's surprisingly small, holds quite a bit of charge and  pretty light to boot. It also charges my devices pretty fast so it's convenoent for a quick boost.  It also comes with a little carrying case which is nice...There isn't an flashlight built in (if that's something you like in a power bank) and it can only charge one device at a time, but I am more than happy with it just based on how convenient this is to carry around everyday.",0
2.0,,"June 12, 2017",Yes,"The battery was plugged in for 2 days and it was still only showing that it was halfway charged. I used it to recharge my iPhone once and tried to recharge it and it seemed to be a dud. It took a very long time to just stop blinking, indicating that it is nearly dead. For a new power bank I'd expect it to work well and it did not. I would avoid Anker products.",0
5.0,,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"Holds charge for several days, multiple full charges. I really like it. Great for taking with me to work or on camping trips or travel when I want to be able to keep my phone charged without having to hunt for appropriate outlets or to be tied down to a wall. Not super light, but reasonably compact. Not something that fits in a pocket (at least not a normal snug jean pocket), but easy to throw in a backpack or purse.",0
5.0,,"May 15, 2016",Yes,"This is my second Anker product after receiving the PowerCore+ 26800 as a gift.  That model is an absolutely beast, and very durable, but it's quite heavy, large, and holds more juice than I need on most days (about 10 iPhone 6s' worth).  I chose the PowerCore 10000 based on the build quality and reliability of the 26800, while wanting a small, lightweight, yet durable battery pack.  The 10000 is truly perfect in my opinion. I wouldn't mind having a second USB port, but I imagine the size would quickly exceed the ""pack of playing cards"" standard. Highly reccommended, along with all other Anker products.  You won't be disappointed!",0
5.0,,"February 14, 2017",Yes,"This is a godsend on the road. I travel a lot (work but also play) and often find myself needing juice. This has enough of it to charge my phone several times, as well as my tablet. Better yet, it charges my phone FAST -- as fast as my mains-powered charger (which is itself a fast charger). In my experience, that is a big difference from most portable chargers. The charger itself charges quickly and takes up only nominal space in my bag. Definitely recommended.",0
5.0,,"January 4, 2019",Yes,Quality product bought for boyfriend for a two week trip across seas. He raved about it I ended up buying myself one for my travels and I couldn’t be more pleased super reliable for travel and everyday use.,0
5.0,,"April 16, 2019",Yes,This was my second Anker batter buy. The charge takes a while to build up but lasts forever. I bought this one for my girlfriend to grow in her purse. Then I stole it back because she didn’t use it to it’s full potential.,0
5.0,,"November 20, 2017",Yes,"I am VERY pleased with this small Anker external battery pack -- it is exactly what I needed and easily supplies an extra charge to my iPhone when I run low on power -- which is pretty much every afternoon.  The unit is compact, fits easily into my briefcase or shoulder bag, and charges the iPhone really quickly.  It holds a lot of power for multiple charges.  I highly recommend this product -- and thanks to Anker for another high-quality product.",0
5.0,,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"Haven't done any tests on it to see exactly how long it lasts, but it's easy to use and provides a quick charged when needed. A little heavy, but that seems par for the course for most power banks.",0
5.0,,"February 19, 2018",Yes,I have owned a few of these in the past few years and they have never lasted long. This is an Anker brand and that says something. This is small and will charge your phone almost as quickly as your plug in quick charge can. The best part? IT LASTS. I will be buying more Anker products...,0
5.0,,"November 12, 2018",Yes,I’ve bought three of these; one for myself and two for kids.  I use mine a lot and keep it in my purse.  Very good battery life.  It’s heavy duty and looks like it should last awhile.  Good value for this product.,0
5.0,,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"Best portable charger ive ever had. When its fully powered, it charges my phone faster than my actual charger. Once it starts to lose battery it gets a little slower but it can charge my phone around 3 times fully without dying on me so I don’t mind, then I just charge it overnight and its back to full.",1
5.0,,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I was skeptical on buying because I had never heard of the brand.  I had bought and returned 3 expensive defective Mophies. Let me tell you this thing charges fast, I've dropped it numerous times and it keeps on going.  My friends are buying them now!",0
5.0,,"April 1, 2018",Yes,Have charged several phones several times and the battery still has 3 bars.  Gave it too my wife but it was a bit heavy for her to keep in her pocketbook.  I took it for myself and use while at one of my jobs when an outlet isn't always available.,0
1.0,,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I do not recommend this product, I have fallen from this product and break down, I am really angry and sad why I break so despite the fall is not a long distance! be careful",0
5.0,,"February 15, 2019",Yes,"Got it for a backpacking trip and the battery inside is big enough that it could fully charge an iPad. The baggie that came with the battery helped a lot--I used it to store the charger cords and the charger itself, which is perfect because I always misplace things. Being able to put both in one bag is perfect and its battery life is wonderful.",1
5.0,,"July 31, 2016",Yes,"It's a little heavy for my purse but the size fits easily and it's been a lifesaver.  Charges my phone surprisingly fast and I can get multiple charges.  While on the road for an extremely busy workday, I had to charge my phone, my mobile hotspot and my IPad and still had plenty of charge left.  To recharge the charger itself takes several hours but that should be expected for as much charge as it delivers.  Terrific device.",0
5.0,,"December 27, 2017",Yes,"I bought this just before hurricane Irma. It helped keep our phones charged while we were without electricity. This would be great for short-term emergencies, camping or hiking trips. It would also be good if you used your phone a lot and just couldn't get to an outlet.",0
5.0,,"August 11, 2017",Yes,"I'm not quite sure how I came this far without owning this power bank. Typically my phone dies at around 5pm, so I need to find a way to charge it throughout the day which came somewhat of a habit...Now that I have this power bank, that's no longer a problem. I can charge my phone (Google Pixel) 3 full times before it has actually run out of battery. Luckily, it's compact enough to be able to keep in my pocket without disturbing me throughout the day.",0
1.0,,"July 11, 2018",Yes,"Ordered two. One for me, one for my son. One immediately wouldn't charge completely. The other worked great for a couple months, now won't hold a change. Very disappointing. Save your money.",2
5.0,,"March 13, 2019",Yes,This thing is awesome!  We took it with us on a recent vacation and we were able to recharge two phones and three tablets...and it only used about half the power!  I have used other portable chargers before and this one is far superior to the others.,0
2.0,,"November 1, 2018",Yes,It charged well when it worked but it didnt last long. It stopped taking a charge in less than a year.,1
5.0,,"January 13, 2019",Yes,"Yes, this is great. I bought this months ago and I have to say it really helped me in a trip overseas. My phone's battery almost died and maps, what-to-do, and important things about my trip was on my phone. This external battery kept my phone alive all day using Google Maps, checking phone numbers, places, texting and more during my trip. If I lost this battery or need another one would definitley buy this brand again.",0
5.0,,"April 10, 2019",Yes,I was looking for a small single charging port power pack to take while out west hunting.  This fits the bill perfectly.  It weighs only 6 ounces and will charge my phone plenty of times before needing a charge.,0
5.0,,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"We had another one of these, but wanted to buy an extra when Hurricane Irma came through. The battery charges quickly and lasts for a long time as well. It's also light so it is easy to carry on trips. I would definitely recommend for emergencies, trips, and even every day usage.",0
5.0,,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"And now also used by the girls for their iPads when needed. Great size, material, and everything about it. Have used it often, have traveled with it. Buy with confidence, I will back it up.",0
5.0,,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"Although this battery has a cheap feeling plastic casing, it is far from cheap. It charges an iPhone 8 to full without dipping under the 75% mark. Anker also does well with their charging utilities.",0
4.0,,"September 7, 2018",Yes,Editing this review because the seller was attentive enough to send me another PowerCore to replace the faulty one. Let’s give this another go shall we!..I say it died after 3 months of owning it... but 3 days of using it. Maybe it was too hot at the beach? Now it’s a $30 paperweight.,0
5.0,,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"Does what it says on the tin. Fast charging, high capacity battery. If I were to complain about something it's not purchasing the even higher capacity battery for longer charging sessions. I own a multitude of different Anker products and they all perform top notch. Definitely recommend this brand.",0
5.0,,"April 7, 2019",Yes,A gift they liked and use,1
5.0,,"August 1, 2017",Yes,"Works VERY well.  Holds a charge over several days of not needing to use it.  And then when I need it, I can get at least 2 charges on my phone before having to recharge this powercore.  Best one I've tried, and still a good buy.",1
5.0,,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"Very durable as i bought the battery pack for a heat vest. Has a long life, which is extremely important. Has a little weight to it but not too noticable. Comes with a carrying case and usb. Great quality.",0
5.0,,"December 9, 2018",Yes,It charges my phone even quicker. It makes me feel safer to have this with me.,1
5.0,,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"This looks and feels like a well made product.  On a full charge, I am able to recharge an iPhone 6 at least 3-4 times.  This also seems to recharge pretty quickly.  I used the charging adapter from an iPad as well as connecting to a computer to charge it.  It does not come with a charging adapter of its own.  This is great to have when travelling as power outlets are not always available or convenient.  Also great to have in case a storm takes out power for several days.",0
5.0,,"July 7, 2018",Yes,"This is the best product I have purchased so far. I bought for hurricane Maria and I still use it on my day to day. I love to charge my phone (iPhone 6+) with it because it charges so much faster, plus it gives the mobility when you’re on the go. It completely charges your phone more than once before the battery runs out and it charges itself pretty quickly. This is a great buy!",0
5.0,,"August 3, 2017",Yes,"Impressed with Anker's products.  I bought this battery pack and an Anker speaker to carry in my cooler bag.  For its capacity, the battery pack is surprisingly light and compact.  LEDs indicate the charge level.  Other than that, it's just a simple brick--as it should be.",1
5.0,,"June 6, 2018",Yes,"My wife's been wanting a portable charger for her cell phone and this Anker PowerCore 10000 knocks it out of the park. This portable charger is extremely handy when she's running errands or spending the afternoon with our kids at local park. It recharges her Samsung 6S incredibly fast. You won't be disappointed! Happy wife, Happy life!",0
3.0,,"April 11, 2019",Yes,"positives: it is lightweight and comes with a little bag that makes it easy to store the cable along with it.Negatives: it only charged my phone 1.5 times.  Also, I didn’t realize that the cable to charge it was not the same cable that is used to charge my iPhone, so if you have an iPhone you need 2 different cables.",0
5.0,,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"I have several portable cell phone chargers, and this one is my favorite.  It is small, not too heavy, but charged my iPhone 3-4 times on one charge.  I used it for a recent trip to Disneyland, and it didn't load down my backpack.  I bought another one for my daughter as I've been super impressed with it.",0
4.0,,"November 26, 2017",Yes,"I love this product and it does everything it claims to. Except for one problem. It WILL NOT charge back up! Traveled abroad and plugged it into my iPhone charger for over 24 hours and nothing. This is a huge inconvenience. I contacted Anker and they said to try to charge it on a different wall charger. So I did. And it charged. On my husband's Anker wall charger. So unless you plan on purchasing BOTH products from Anker, don't waste your money or your time. Keep looking..Update: Anker support has dealt with the matter and sent a replacement. Therefore the 4* from the 2* however, I did end up purchasing an Anker wall charger as well.",0
5.0,,"March 11, 2018",Yes,"I’ve waited for a few months to write a review about this battery,because the have a tendency to lose charge capacity at a very high rate after a certain time,gladly,this bad boy is not the case! Has been old faithful since day one,and design is cool too!",0
5.0,,"January 31, 2018",Yes,"This is super useful and has multiple charges in it.  My wifes iPhone 6 Plus was running down repeatedly during the day so I got her this and its solved all her issues of getting thru the day.  Great price, holds great charge and easy to use and charge.",0
5.0,,"October 2, 2017",Yes,"I was pleasantly surprised by this unit. It is EXTREMELY light. I've had a portable battery charger from a different company for the last few years and while it worked fine, it was a heavy brick in my backpack everyday. I can't believe how thin and light this is compared to that. I'm very happy with this purchase and I think you will be too.",0
5.0,,"January 7, 2019",Yes,Charged numerous iphones and ipads. Life saver!!!,1
5.0,,"July 16, 2018",Yes,"Got this for the wife, she loves it, does her iPad and iPhone in the car very well.",1
5.0,,"March 14, 2018",Yes,I really like this Anker PowerCore.  It charges my iphone really fast and so easy to take with you especially on hiking trips.  The Anker support people are REALLY WONDERFUL and help you anyway they can.  They are very responsive to all your questions and issues.,0
5.0,,"November 14, 2016",Yes,Ok...I have a LG G5 phone and let me tell you I can not be happier with this charger! This thing charged my phone fully 3 times plus charged my Kindle Fire in 1 charge! Plus it holds the charge for weeks! I'm putting this on my Christmas gifts list! Love love love!,1
5.0,,"September 19, 2016",Yes,"This little powerbank is a beast for its size, it fits comfortably in my hand and can charge my HTC One M8 smartphone 3-4 times.  I thought about getting a larger powerbank, but realized it might be too heavy/large to carry and I think I was right.  I'd probably rather get two of these for travel if I wanted double the capacity, rather than buying one that's double the size.",0
5.0,,"February 27, 2017",Yes,"This is probably the best portable charger you could find. This thing will last all day and it will fully charge multiple phones from 0% to 100%. I swear I've never used something that has charged my phone as fast as this little thing does either. It's super simple to use and the little bag it comes with is perfect for traveling with it. I ski with it, I take it on trips, I use it in place of using a wall charger because why not? I've gone through a lot of portable chargers because they're just not trusty or never last long but this thing is pretty legit. I'll always buy products made by Anker now specifically because of how good this product is. I didn't even get paid to say this I'm just seriously so impressed with this thing I swear",0
5.0,,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"Great purchase... i’ve been using it regularly during the past months ... same charging power in exceptionally short time ....For me it is of great help ,,, thank you Anker..",0
5.0,,"August 8, 2018",Yes,"Here’s the thing...this little guy worked perfect for me until malfunctioned. BUT, I simply emailed Anker, they emailed back with an easy to follow email, and BAM in about 5 days I had a brand new one that works great! (I had to prove that my previous one was actually broken, but I expected that)",1
5.0,,"August 6, 2017",Yes,"After charging the Anker 10000 we charged our 2 cell Samsung S4's from 15% to 85% in less than an hour,...4 times. The last charge we let go all the way to 100%. By then, over 3 days, 1 lamp of the 4 were left lighted on the Anker. We charged the Anker and time will tell how many charges it can handle over time..",0
5.0,,"January 28, 2019",Yes,I bought this to use with a heater vest I bought for my husband for Christmas. So far so good. It's nice how it lies flat in the pouch &amp; doesn't bulge out like some batteries.,0
5.0,,"March 30, 2017",Yes,This thing is a savior for vacations! I've used it twice now on two 2-week long vacations and I think I may have only needed to charge it once each time.  I even keep it in my purse on days I will not be near a charger. Yesterday I used it after not having charged the power pack for over a month and it still had 4/5 battery power! Charges my phone a little slower than plugging it into the wall but still the best battery pack for your money in my opinion.,0
5.0,,"November 28, 2017",Yes,Excellent product bought on the sale after thanksgiving. This is my third ankle powercore I have one 5000 one 20000 and now this 10000..I only buy a anker brand when it’s on sale ..My iphone6plus never runs out of power and I can keep the gps on 24 hours,0
5.0,,"August 18, 2018",Yes,"This was my first ANKER product. Still in perfect condition. Dropped this so many times, still works fine. I use this product EVERY DAY!! I would highly recommend their products!!",1
5.0,,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Not really not an expert on this technology but it does what I want it to do. I've bought a few other Anker products and their quality does not disappoint. Price point is hard to beat also.,0
5.0,,"April 7, 2018",Yes,It was good for 9 months and now it died from one day to the other. Very disappointing because I love Anker accessories as they usually very durable and good quality product. Even if I bought the special Anker USB cables the power bank does not work with any charger now...Update 16 April..Anker contacted me and following their excellent communication they replaced the faulty unit for free. I also purchased more from their special charging USB cable that really helps fast charging. I still believe that this company makes the best price/quality products.,0
4.0,,"September 29, 2018",Yes,"I like the reliability of the Powercore 10000 use with my iPhone and holds a good charge for a long time. This has been very helpful so I no longer have to look for an outlet when away from home.  The disappointment was that I couldn’t use the provided cable with my HP stream tablet, which has a round hole port for charging. The tablet cable isn’t detachable to accommodate  Anker’s. But overall I’m quite pleased especially when I’m out and about with my phone and it needs charging.",0
4.0,,"August 15, 2018",Yes,"I am very happy with this product. I purchased the Anker powercore 10000, and it worked great for me for months. Then all of a sudden stopped working. I contacted the Anker custom service and they gladly sent me a replacement. The replacement has been so far so good. I also own a few other Anker products and they also have worked great for me. The fact that customer service was so helpful and were glad to replace my product was awesome. They have also checked in with me after receiving the replacement to see if I was satisfied with their help.",0
5.0,,"November 27, 2018",Yes,Lasts for a long time! Gives my phone a lot of charges!,1
4.0,,"November 27, 2016",Yes,"Good product and delivers on its promise of carrying enough energy to recharge my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge 2+ times per charge.  It was a bit heavier than I expected, but that's just me.  Takes a long time to recharge, though.  will have to see how its longevity holds up, if it is like other batteries that crap out in just a few months.  We'll see how it all goes.",0
1.0,,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"Do not buy this product.  It is a worthless piece of junk, and it failed me when I actually needed it.  I used it to charge my phone once or twice.  Then, it completely stopped working.  It's fully charged, but it won't turn on.  And since it won't turn on, it won't charge anything.  I've tried everything I can think of (e.g., different cords, different devices, etc.), and nothing works.  So now I have an extremely expensive paper weight.  Stay as far away from this product as possible.",0
5.0,,"January 22, 2019",Yes,I love this battery. It takes a while to fully charge but it lasts a really long time. You can definitely get 2 full charges out of it. It has been dropped on to asphalt and still works. Just some minor physical damage.,0
5.0,,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"We bought this before a long trip, knowing that we'd have trouble finding places to recharge.  The price was right.  We were able to bring two iPhones to full charge twice before needing to recharge the Anker.  We've since recommended to friends who are happy with theirs.",0
5.0,,"July 24, 2017",Yes,"very nice. I commute by bike.  Where I work I cannot bring in my cell phone or bike computer but want a way to charge them in the locker in our lobby. this charges my phone , garmin 520 , garmin tail light with no issues.",1
5.0,,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"This is an amazing rapid power charger!  It charges an IPad faster than plugging it in to AC, even while using it! The size is very manageable--about the size of a deck of cards. I travel frequently and I'm not always near a power source.  I just make sure to charge the Anker each evening &amp; then none of my devices will be without power during the day. I was so happy with it, I have purchased two more--one for my husband &amp; one for my sister who can't seem to remember to keep her devices charged.",0
2.0,,"September 8, 2017",Yes,wont keep charge after using it for a few weeks it was returned.,2
5.0,,"June 14, 2018",Yes,"Can't live without it.  So much so, we bought a second one.  There isn't a day that goes by that we don't use these chargers.  Can charge a fully drained phone twice before needing a recharge.  We usually charge at night when we go to be to have to use for the next day.  Works great for amusement parks and outings with the kids.",0
5.0,,"June 11, 2018",Yes,I can't say enough of about Anker products. I have purchased over 4 batteries like this over the years and also recommend them to all my friends. I don't think I will buy another battery from a company unless they do something revolutionary.,0
1.0,,"October 25, 2018",Yes,"It isn’t holding charge enough to fully charge my phone. I have to take the bus for around one hour and half and same in the way back, but it can’t even catch up with that. It just doesn’t work as other reviews claim. Don’t buy this one.",0
5.0,,"November 10, 2018",Yes,This thing is seriously a life saver. I travel a lot and unfortunately my phone battery life sucks. I can normally get 4 full charges from this little buddy. Great buy and I highly recommend it.,0
5.0,,"December 15, 2018",Yes,"The batter life is perfect with this. It doesn’t take too long to charge, &amp; it’ll charge your phone FAST. It’s great when you’re out but don’t have access to outlets for some reason. And there’s 4 whole charges once it’s totally charged.",0
4.0,,"October 24, 2018",Yes,Product works as advertised but the plastic case is super slippery and it's popped out of my grasp several times.  Just flies out of the hand.  Luckily it has survived and I am very careful with it now.,0
5.0,,"December 19, 2016",Yes,Great design! I have a brand new Honor 8 32GB and the Anker PowerCore 10000 Charge the mobile off in 2.30 hours and with the original Charger it takes 1.45 hours so I think its a really good time for the Anker taking into cosideration that is not the original Honor 8 mobile Charger. Highly recommended...It comes with a usb cable for most of the andriod phones and also a cool mini bag.,0
5.0,,"May 30, 2017",Yes,I purchased this one to supplement my existing ANKER battery. This one is a great size for the number of mAh you get. It works just like you think it would and is small enough to easily fit into a pocket while you are connected to the device you are charging. the PowerIQ seems to work well and charges my devices quickly. Other batteries might be slightly prettier (Mophie) but they don't work any better than the ANKER which are much cheaper. If you are looking for a great battery for a good price you can't go wrong with any of the ANKER batteries.,0
1.0,,"December 9, 2018",Yes,This was such a disappointing charger. There are other models I would recommend as this takes hours to charge and then barely charges my phone once. This model does hold a charge whatsoever. Waste of money,0
5.0,,"April 13, 2019",Yes,"Phenomenal!  My work requires me to be on my phone almost my entire shift so on my 10+hr days this is my lifesaver!  Charges exceptionally quickly and is so easy to pop in my pocket or purse or charge on the go.  Also, it's super nice that the battery itself doesn't heat up when charging your device.  100% would recommend!",0
5.0,,"November 9, 2017",Yes,"Small, convenient, great charge. This thing will charge my phone over and over. I let it sit fully charged for over 6 months between uses and it still had enough juice to charge my phone, my girlfriend's and my friends from nearly 0 battery life. Awesome charger.",0
2.0,,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"When I made this purchase in March it was great but now, 7 months later, it's just stopped working. I've only had to use it about three times. Never dropped it. Never gotten wet. Never left to charge too long. However now whenever I try to use it, it charges for about 2minutes and quits regardless of its own full battery..Don't get sucked in by the low price if you want something truly dependable.",0
5.0,,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for a trip to Jordan and loved it so much, I bought a second for my upcoming backpacking trip. It charged my phone and watch several times in one charge. I couldn’t be happier. It also came in a cute case.",0
5.0,,"May 8, 2017",Yes,"I got 3 full charges to my Iphone 6.  It took about two hours to charge from 1% to 100%.  The Anker 10000 battery recharged on AC (wall) power quickly - probably 1-2 hours, although the charger makes a difference on recharging speed.  Using my Anker 21W Dual USB Solar Charger it took a lot longer, but again, that's about the source not the battery.  It is 6.2 ounces, a bit heavier than I expected but by no means heavy; I just don't think I'll lug it around in my purse permanently...You can tell the level of charge because it has four lights.  When all the lights are lit it's fully charged. Lights turn off as it loses charge. When it's charging the ""cell"" that's charging blinks; already charged ""cells"" are lit solid.  Ex. You are charging the battery and 1/4 of the battery is charged but it's working to charge more.  In this example, there is one of the four lights lit and the light next to it is blinking.  If it's not charging but you are using it to charge something nothing blinks on the indicator, but it still tells you how much charge you have left.  For example if there are only two of the four lights lit, that means you have half the charge left in the battery.  If you are not charging something nor charging the battery, there are no lights lit. There's a handy button on the unit you can push to light up the lights to see how much charge you have left. I'm sorry if this is Greek, the whole thing is perfectly logical and easy. The indicator lights are particularly helpful.",3
5.0,,"June 10, 2018",Yes,Charges your phone many many times  before needing to be recharged itself. Consider buying one of Anker’s smaller versions if you are going to carry it around with you. This one is a little heavy for my purse.,0
1.0,,"January 25, 2019",Yes,"Amazon REALLY dropped the ball with recommending this. It didn’t work. And I read all the other 1 star reviews and figured it probably wouldn’t work, and now I’m frustrated that everyone was right! Now I have to waste my time sending this garbage back.",1
5.0,,"November 1, 2016",Yes,"This is a very good back up battery, and will fully charge my iPhone about three times! On my 15 minute break this will charge my iPhone enough that it can last the whole day. I use my phone to play games and the internal battery will not last a whole day. This battery is small and compact, and comes with a pouch to hold the battery and the charging cord. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice compact back up battery for your cell phone!",0
5.0,,"May 9, 2017",Yes,"Small. Light weight. I like Anker products. Had same 10k batt in larger size of theirs got stolen. This one is even better as it is less weight, same durability, less space. I take it with me backpacking. Now i keep it with me at all times just in case. Get 2 + charges on Gal. S6. Only concern is losing it due to small size and color. Not fast, but does the job.",0
5.0,,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"This is not my first power bank, I used several before, and this is by far the best! It charges so fast, even while I am using my iphone6. I feel like it charges faster than using the original Apple phone charger. It’s a little heavy, but it’s small and compact, quality is really good. I tried to let my phone battery run really low to 10% and charge it with only the power bank, I could probably charge it close to 4 full charges. I highly recommend this product!",0
5.0,,"March 30, 2019",Yes,Have taken this out a few times and have charged both my and my boyfriends phones quickly! Also charged someone’s phone at a wedding recently and they were surprised their phone was fully charged up! Great price!! Battery life is long and I don’t have to charge it too often at all!,0
5.0,,"December 4, 2017",Yes,"Amazing battery! I picked this one based on the reviews I read here, and I was not disappointed. I've been using it during my time abroad, about 4 months now, and it has been so incredibly useful. It does take a long time to charge the battery itself (maybe 3 or so hours), but it's good to recharge my phone about 3 times off of that. It's nice for piece of mind alone, but is also very good for weekend trips or when I am out all day and using my phone a lot..The size is amazing, perfectly fits in the pocket of my tote bag, and for the price you really cannot beat it...I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!",0
5.0,,"April 17, 2019",Yes,"I love this Power Core!  I bought it to charge my phone when in Alaska on vacation, we were going to be outdoors quite a bit and in past visits my phone battery died quickly in the cold. This little block kept my phone charged so I could take pics anytime I wanted. 17 days in AK and only charged it a handful of times. Well, well worth it's cost.",0
4.0,,"February 24, 2017",Yes,"Pros: Lightweight, Small Size, and High Capacity. The travel pouch is particularly useful..Cons: It does take a couple hours to fully charge, although it's due to the high capacity...Notes: Seems to charge the same speed, if not faster with my iPhone 6 as using a wall plug. It saved my phone's life several time already as I travel around a lot without a way to charge my phone.",0
5.0,,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"Works extremely well! I charged it once before a trip. I rarely used it on the trip because we had a car charger. A few weeks later, this was still in my purse and I needed a quick charge. Sure enough, weeks later, after only charging it once, it still held a full charge and worked for the next 3 days.",0
5.0,,"October 27, 2017",Yes,The Anker Powercore 10000 works great. It didn't take long to charge and is capable of charging both my wife's and my phone fairly quickly. I like that it comes with mesh carry pouch and comes with fairly detailed instructions on its use. I wish the USB cable it came with was a little longer but I have a bunch of extra USB cables laying around that I was able to use. It also feels pretty sturdy yet it is not super heavy.,0
5.0,,"September 27, 2016",Yes,This a great product. It's very compact and portable. I like the little bag that it came with too. It charges up relatively fast and provides my android phone with about four solid charges. I recommend this product who is looking for a simple recharget for their phone or tablet...,1
5.0,,"October 4, 2017",Yes,"I bought this for my son who was going to college, the other night he was watching a football game on his iPhone when it started to run out of power. The PC10000 had plenty of power to finish the game and recharge his phone for the rest of the evening. He loves it.",0
5.0,,"October 20, 2017",Yes,"What an amazing product. I keep a charged one in my purse. Allows me to watch movies without using up my phone battery on an airplane, always feel secure that I won't have my Kindle die on me at a great point in a book when away from home...just a great tool to have! I love it!",0
1.0,,"April 13, 2019",Yes,"This took 20 hours to charge, then drained before I could get my iPhone charged. Returning for replacement. In the past I have loved Anker products.",0
2.0,,"November 11, 2017",Yes,"It's OK. It's not as powerful and good as advertised..My previous two yr old Anker last longer..Bit disappointed to be honest, was expecting more/better.",1
5.0,,"April 4, 2017",Yes,"My son bought this to play Pokemon Go (aka the infamous battery vampire app) on his phone.  This thing is incredible!  He has played to his heart's content, two hours ""on the hunt"" and has not drained it below 75% charged.  It is small and light weight, and sturdily built.  An excellent product for a fair price.",0
5.0,,"April 18, 2016",Yes,"Love this little power bank. It's small and works wonderfully. Especially when using the USB they provided. Unfortunately after only a week, the micro USB got bent and no longer works. I use the cord that came with my phone and it works well enough, but doesn't charge as quickly. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone on the go. Only holds about 1.5 full charges, but that's enough to get me through about 2 days w/o having to recharge the power bank.",0
5.0,,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"My second Anker product, they work very well and are dependable, quality made products. Used mine extensively this week in Disney World, kept everyones phone up and running every day. I highly recommend any of Anker's many products",0
2.0,,"February 25, 2018",Yes,This battery does not reliably supply my phone.  Sometimes the software on my phone will tell me that the battery is not providing enough charge.  I stopped using it and now prefer to use the Zagg batteries which are affordable and very reliable.,0
4.0,,"April 10, 2019",Yes,Dropped one in the lake and had to get another and went back to this battery because it held up pretty well. I would buy it again and recommend it.,0
4.0,,"April 17, 2019",Yes,"This battery works very nicely and has an incredible battery capacity! My only warning to potential buyers is to be careful about overcharging your device. This power bank does not have a mechanism to stop it from overcharging your device and has the potential to damage your device's battery. To avoid this, simply unplug the device before it reaches 100% or just as your device reaches 100%. If you leave it charging beyond 100% IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR BATTERY. Be careful.",0
5.0,,"January 2, 2017",Yes,"This is the 2nd time and the 5th battery pack I have purchased from them.  That should tell you what I think.  I have purchased their higher end Qualcom 3 model, Qualcom 2 model and iPhone model of chargers.  They are cheaper units out there but I ""KNOW"" these are solid, works without fail, etc. etc.  I will only purchase this brand in the future.",0
5.0,,"March 18, 2019",Yes,Works great when my phone or iPad battery is low. Charges iPhone and iPad quickly and the Power Core holds a charge a long time. Can charge my phone up multiple times before I need to recharge it.,0
5.0,,"August 21, 2018",Yes,This is the best charger ever. It is the second one I have bought from this company. I took one to Europe for 4 months and it never lost battery life or anything. This batter pack lasts forever and it can charge my phone fully I would say at least 3-5 times. It is the biggest life saver and is the best purchase. I gave my first one to my dad and got another for myself.,0
5.0,,"June 2, 2018",Yes,"The best! I use this to charge my phone even when I have access to electricity just because it's so much faster. Game changer. It's a little heavy, so keep in mind if you're wanting to travel light. It's about the same weight as a full flask if that helps ;)",0
4.0,,"January 22, 2019",Yes,"Got this extra battery for my old iPhone. It charging the phone during an hour. It’s a good battery when you out of home. It’s showing its own energy level in the right way. Even 2 points of 4 is enough for couple days. Come in a dog protection bag, it’s convenient to keep it like new for a long time! The only problem, that input mini usb charger is always falling apart.",0
5.0,,"March 20, 2017",Yes,"Small, heavy-duty and simple - charged it up (arrived with half charge), plugged into my phone and got a full charge for 25% of the Anker. Makes travel so much simpler knowing I won't be tethered to a charging station at the airport or risk my kindle dying on the plane. Also compatible with ""rapid charging"" on supported USB 3. Gave my phone 25% in about 20 minutes. Push-button indicator lights show remaining charge for extra convenience (4 dots).",0
5.0,,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"Absolutely LOVE this product! I ordered this as part of a gift for my husband and we’ve ended up stealing it back and forth from each other! The battery life is awesome, it’s compact, and fast! Everyone should have one of these! We will definitely be purchasing these for gifts for everyone!",0
5.0,,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"I have numerous Anker products (charging cables, wall chargers and another portable battery as well) and I highly reccomend the company’s products. My family is going on. 3+ week European trip and I wanted to get an additional portable charger while we’re out and about (we already have a smaller Anker portable charger my wife uses) so we purchaed this one too. It is small, charges fast and just works.",0
5.0,,"April 17, 2017",Yes,"Compact size,  well-made have purchased a larger version before.Iit did take almost 18 hours to charge the first time but so far charger works well. Have used it twice to recharge my phone without recharging the battery and it's at 75%. But with all batteries like this time will tell, will update my review in six months",0
5.0,,"May 21, 2016",Yes,"Hands down, these are the best external batteries I've ever had the pleasure of using. I work in East Africa and the power supply here is inconsistent (at best!), so I make sure to have my Anker charged in case we lose power for a day or two. It charges my phone several times before running out of juice, and in the first 30 minutes it can charge my phone to nearly 70%...I recommend these to anyone who will listen.",0
5.0,,"June 7, 2018",Yes,really good powerbank. Holds charge really good. I can charge about 2 and half phones with it. have had no issues with the cables or the battery not working after a couple of charge like other portable chargers. the carrying case is a decent addition but i dont use it,0
5.0,,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"Compact design, and it holds a charge for a long time! Easy to use and it comes with a neat little mesh bag to carry it in when you're traveling. Just plug it in and the LED indicators tell you how much juice it's got. With this baby, I was able to use my phone during Hurricane Irma to browse my favorite websites for people aged 18 and over! Keep that in mind for the next natural disaster!",0
4.0,,"July 5, 2017",Yes,"The charge on this is great, I can charge my iphone for up to four times. The only downside is that the device itself takes FOREVER to recharge after its spent. I'm talking like 4-6 hours. I guess it makes sense because it holds so much charge, but it's kind of insane. Its also pretty heavy, but its compact enough that its not much of an issue to carry around.",1
1.0,,"December 20, 2018",Yes,"Before I bought this I did my due diligence as always and the reviews were stellar. Now that it has stopped working after only one charge, I now see many of the same complaints. I am hoping that they will get this obviously bad batch replaced by new ones that work. I can not afford to have a charger that is not working. It is my business and personal safety net on the go. Waiting to hear back from the company...",0
5.0,,"October 17, 2018",Yes,I bought two of these for traveling overseas.  They were fine to carry on a plane and worked great.  Fast charging and hold a charge for a long time.  The lights on the unit tell you easily how much battery you have left.  Recommend them for travelers.,0
1.0,,"February 15, 2019",Yes,"When I received it, I was super excited so I put it to charge. Waited for it to be fully charged. When I tried to plug in my phone charger cable to it, the lights of the charge would blink and disappear. I tried this multiple times and nothing. Then would I would press the button on the side to see the battery life , it would show 1 light. So I am hopeful in assuming that this came in extremely faulty because as of right now , I am not happy with this purchase.",0
5.0,,"December 13, 2018",Yes,"Love it! This worked really well on my latest trip. It held a charge for a long time, is sleek and small so fit in my purse, and saved me when my phone would normally have died! Great quality.",0
4.0,,"July 27, 2017",Yes,It works great!  It came in handy on vacation and the kids loved it!  It does have some weight to it but nothing like the older one my husband has!  My husband ended up taking it on a recent camp/hike outing and he was so happy he did!  He used it and it still came back with a lot of power on it!,0
5.0,,"December 13, 2017",Yes,This has been a blessing for my wife while she is away. She loves being on her phone and is constantly draining her battery. Now her phone never dies. Never leaves her side when we are out with friends or at a movie. The Anker has not only sunk her low battery issues but has left more time for us to get some time alone. Now we can both be on our phones all the time. I still have to sit next to the wall charger but I can still see the iPad where we watch most of our shows and movies.,0
5.0,,"May 19, 2016",Yes,"I bought this so I could charge my phone during a weekend backpacking trip, so I was looking for something that was small, not too heavy, but would still perform well. So far, I have been very happy with the product. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy 5, and using this charger I can go from almost dead to a complete charge in less time than in takes using a wall charger. I was able to get several complete charges out of the device over the span of about a week before I had to charge it back up again. Although I originally bought it for travel, it is small and light enough that I now carry it in my purse for when my phone needs juice on the go. The *only* potential downside I have found so far is that it does not come with a wall charger for when it needs a charge itself-- only a USB charging cable.",0
5.0,,"January 9, 2019",Yes,This is the perfect portable charger for those who are on-the-move and need several charges for phones or headsets before recharging the battery device. Charging a Samsung Galaxy S6 with this device provides me with 3 charges from a nearly drained battery. Anker has never disappointed and always provides superior products. This device is no different.,0
5.0,,"July 21, 2017",Yes,"Very pleased  Easy to charge.  Lights on unit let you clearly know when it is fully charged.  Both its charge cable and the little 4"" iPhone wire fit nicely in the cool pouch that comes with it.  Charged my iPhone quickly THREE times off one charge.  Bought a second one for my daughter.",0
5.0,,"July 29, 2017",Yes,"Ride an hour each way to work everyday.  This thing keeps my gopro juiced all week.  That's 10 hours@1080 60fps on one charge. It's not water proof but I was easily able to fix that.  Small enough thatI mounted on my helmet,  opposite side of my camera.  Balances the weight perfectly",0
5.0,,"May 18, 2017",Yes,"I first wrote a negative review as this product completely failed to work. It charged up OK, but when connected to a cellphone or touchpad, it charged them for no more than a minute before switching off. Repeated attempts failed. I had an Anker charger before and that worked OK. On contacting Anker to indicate the problem they offered to replace without receiving the old one back as I live in Costa Rica. The replacement arrived and is so far working fine. This is excellent customer service.",0
5.0,,"February 24, 2017",Yes,"Bought this to take on an upcoming trip overseas and tested it several times just to make sure it was good. I was able to charge my iPhone 6+ 5 times from 50% on one charge of the pack. I don't know how fast others are, this one takes a couple of hours but it is fine for what I need. I would definitely buy again.",0
5.0,,"June 4, 2017",Yes,This is an absolute must.  This has saved me several times when my kids need to quickly charge their devices.  I needed it while sight seeing and there wasn't an outlet plug I could use.  This really saved the day.  This device stays charged a long time.  I convinced another family member to purchase one.,0
5.0,,"October 10, 2017",Yes,"This pack holds a charge for a long, long time when unused.  I have gone months without using it and still had full power showing on the meter..It charges my Galaxy 7 rapidly up to 3 times (maybe more...i haven't tested it past that)  from 30% power.",0
5.0,,"October 22, 2018",Yes,"bought this item for an overseas trip and it worked flawlessly and as expected. Compact, durable and hold a charge for a substantial amount of time. NO reason to purchase anything with larger battery. This serves its purpose.  Many thanks to Anker who quickly expedited a new case to me after emailing that current case has failed.  Again,  company was on top of communication and handled it very quickly. Would not hesitate to buy from this company again.",0
1.0,,"July 25, 2017",Yes,"Quite possibly the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon...This company sent me a defective product. Initially, I thought my case was very rare; however, after doing research, I found out that I am not alone in this problem...I called customer service and they told me to ""troubleshoot"" the device. I was not aware you can ""troubleshoot"" a box of batteries. I followed all the directions they told me, wasting four hours of my life waiting for the product to work after plugging in the device. I'm sure after I tell them it doesn't work they will tell me to ship back the product, thus increasing the time wasted. I need this product because I am traveling next week and it seems as if I am out of luck since this ""ship back"" process will take 1-2 weeks...I usually never write product reviews on Amazon but this product and this company deserves one.",6
5.0,,"July 8, 2016",Yes,"The unit is very small and light weight and very reasonably priced, in fact, it was the smallest, lightest and least expensive portable battery of this capacity I could find. I was not familiar with the Anker brand but this and all the other Anker products I saw on Amazon had very good reviews so I went for it. I'm glad I did. I did not do a scientific study but the unit itself charges very fast and in turn charges my iPhone 6 about as fast as a wall charger a total of about 2.5 times before running completely down. The include mesh bag is just large enough to hold the battery and the included micro USB cable plus a 1 meter Lightning cable and a small USB wall charger so everything I need to use it is all together in one place. I am very impressed with this product and have no complaints. It does what it is supposed to do and does it very well.",0
5.0,,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"my second time purchasing this battery, my last one lasted me three years. I take this thing to concerts in my pocket and it is always in my backpack.  Ipads take up the charge, though my phone can take three charges typically",0
5.0,,"December 27, 2016",Yes,I have a Galaxy S7 Edge and the only thing I dont like is the fact that there is not an interchangable battery. So I saw this on my daily deals and ordered quick fast and in a hurry. This has been the perfect addition to my phone. I'm out all day and don't always have access to a charger. This portable charger works great. I let it charge overnight and use it throughout the day. Works perfect!,0
5.0,,"November 9, 2017",Yes,This has been very useful for those times your cell phone battery runs low and not able to charge at an electrical outlet.  I used i a few times at conventions and was able to quickly recharge my Iphone 6  three times with some juice left to spare.,0
5.0,,"January 12, 2019",Yes,I have now ordered 3 of these travel chargers. Two have been for very tech grandgirls who love having access to keeping phones charged. We’re perfect when we went on cruise. We could all keep our phones charged wherever we might be. On ship or off at a port. So compact and convenient. Can get at least 2 full charges before having to recharge unit.,0
5.0,,"November 3, 2018",Yes,By far one of the best charging ports I have ever had. I only bought this one because my friend had recommended it. The battery life is awesome about 4 days!,0
5.0,,"January 8, 2019",Yes,"I love my portable charger, I've even purchased some for my younger siblings for Christmas. My personal one that I've had since summer started having issues, I emailed customer service and they were extremely prompt and helpful. As I've grown older, I realized that customer service goes a very long way. I highly recommend this product, I never go out without it.",0
5.0,,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"Bought it for my mom, she simply loves it. But before handing it to her I used the product for myself for few days and It really handful device while traveling and not struggling to charge our phone. Moreover, related to its amount of mAH the size of the device is perfect to carry as it doesn't take much of the space, unlike its competitors.",0
5.0,,"March 24, 2019",Yes,Carried this with me throughout a month long trip through asia. The small size is added convenience which is one of the reasons why I got it Battery life is amazing on this thing.,0
5.0,,"December 5, 2018",Yes,This charger is just what i needed! It hold a good charge for days and it charges my phone pretty quickly! Good product! I would recommend to anyone.,0
5.0,,"March 20, 2018",Yes,You already know this should be with you everyday and every place you go. You never know when you need some juice for any of your devices. I own two of them one for me and my wife so she don’t bother me asking for my battery pack.,0
5.0,,"March 2, 2017",Yes,"Man Its ANKER!!.What a great lightweight charger!.I now have several Anker Batteries, Several Anker Cables and about 6-7 Anker Plugs..If I had a boat I would buy an Anchor ANKER!.They are always on time, Reliable and Quality made!!!.Never Disappoint!!.and no I'm not getting paid for this endorsement!",0
5.0,,"October 7, 2017",Yes,I use this to charge my iPhone 6 Plus. It lasts easily all day with my wife and I using our phones and bumping them back up to around 85%. It sat on the shelf for a couple months after getting it and it was still fully charged when we started using it. This thing rocks.,0
5.0,,"September 18, 2018",Yes,"I'm so happy I purchased this battery pack. I've always bought cheap ones from the back to school section at Target, but this is well worth the price. I only charge this maybe once every 2 to 3 weeks and I'm able to use it to charge my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) from 15 to 100% 4-5 times in those weeks because it doesn't lose battery as fast as cheap alternatives when not in use. I'm so happy with this product and I will absolutely buy it again one day.",0
5.0,,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"Small, solid, and lots of power. In addition to charging my iPhone, I use the Anker to recharge my Apple Watch when traveling internationally. Great product. At first I was concerned that there was only one charging slot but as it turns out, I typically only charge one item at a time. Very happy with this device.",0
5.0,,"April 9, 2018",Yes,I bought this thing specifically for our trip to Disney World knowing we'd be at the parks all day with no way to charge my phone. Let me tell you it was a lifesaver!!!  Multiple people in my group were able to charge their iPhones back up to full on just one full charge of the portable charger itself. Each night I would charge it to full and it carried us all through the next day.,0
5.0,,"June 12, 2018",Yes,My daughter's iPhone is forever going dead! She attended a music festival last year and with thousands of people around it's hard to keep track of your friends. This becomes even more difficult when you are dealing with a phone that doesn't want to keep a charge for long. This year I decided to purchase this charger for her to take to the festival. She loved it! She said it worked great! She not only kept her phone charged but her friends as well. Awesome product!,0
5.0,,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"So with any of these chargers I was skeptical. I charged it up 3 days ago.... I have been using my phone and using it to charge my phone ever since with no issues and it's still on the 1st charge. I also use my phone to listen to music while I work so I'm always using a lot of juice. This am, I went to look and not only was my phone at 100% juice but my husband took the charger! I think I need a second one for him cause it's so awesome.",0
5.0,,"March 27, 2017",Yes,"wow! i've used some cheap power banks before and this one BLOWS THEM AWAY.. or maybe i'm not used to having this much power haha.. i have yet to drain this one out! out of 4 lights most of the times i've used it, it stays at 4 .. sometimes 3.. and only a couple times went down to 2 and that was for concerts! awesome power bank!",0
5.0,,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"Fits perfectly in my pocket or purse- got it to use for Pokémon go mostly, and have fallen in love with it’s size, versatility, and power level!..Highly recommend to anyone looking for a portable charger that packs a punch.",0
5.0,,"January 17, 2019",Yes,This thing is amazing! I took it to Disneyworld and it worked like a champ. I was at the parks for 3 days and I didn’t even have to recharge the pack the entire time. A full battery life gave me 4 1/2 charges on my iPhone 7. I was even playing Pokémon Go half the time. I was seriously blown away!! I’d recommend this to anyone.,0
4.0,,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"Feels quality made, love the additional case. However I just don't feel like this thing lives up to 10000 mah. Barely supplies my phone with 3 charges. It's an old very power hungry phone with a faltering battery. Maybe the phones the problem and I shouldn't judge this product from that. Someone with some battery knowledge feel free to let me know.",0
5.0,,"December 27, 2016",Yes,"I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He had the lipstick charger for a few years but it broke so I bought this one to replace the old one. He is so happy because his phone chargers quicker. What it most like him is that is not as heavy as mine, is very light and he can carry it in his pocket pants.",0
5.0,,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"This portable charger is a great size for hiking with a small day pack or fitting into a purse. It charges itself in a reasonable amount of time and charges my phone and tablet very quickly (30% - 100% in just over an hour for my phone, more like 3 hours for tablet). When I was experiencing issues with the charge time (taking 4+ hours to charge the phone 30%-100%) I reached out to the customer service team and they assisted me promptly. The issue ended up being a faulty Anker power cable, which the company remedied quickly by mailing me a new cable free of charge under my warranty.",0
5.0,,"April 28, 2017",Yes,Updating my review:.This company has excellent service and accountability. . I purchased two and one didn't charge. They replaced the product and works perfectly. Couldn't ask for better service and prompt delivery. I am very happy as my new one works and Ready to take anywhere as my go to backup -thank you Anker !!,0
5.0,,"January 28, 2018",Yes,"When this charger is fully charged my phone can get 4 full charges from it. I have a smaller lipstick-sized one as well and this one is so much better. It's a little more bulky, but totally worth it for the performance.",0
4.0,,"May 21, 2016",Yes,"It indeed is a good size and looks sleek. I am still unsure about the amount of charges it gives. Charge from battery gets drained if I accidentally leave it plugged into my phone or tablet after they have become fully charged, so I guess just keep an eye on your product while charging and unplugged once complete so you don't get stuck with a dead portable battery after one charge. Feeling like I wrote ""charge"" way too many times. You get the idea.",0
5.0,,"August 5, 2018",Yes,This is my second purchase of this charger. First one was lost on an airplane. LOVE IT! I even take it with me when I am skiing all day- and it helps keep my phone charged and my music rocking,0
5.0,,"January 29, 2017",Yes,"I have owned a smart phone for nearly 10 yrs now and I have researched and tested 'many' different types of charging packs. From extended cases to humongous power banks that barely fit in my pocket. I tell you this because if there have been no reviews before this that could ever convince you then I ask you to listen to this one...The power bank above, which is only a 10000 mAh charging bank from Anker is possibly the BEST charger on the market. I have turned over many friends to this charger since my purchase and they have all agreed with my review. It is by far the FASTEST charge I have ever seen to a cell phone. My mom who has an Iphone has one, I have a Galaxy S6 Edge Plus and it works on both with speed and efficiency. It fits easily in your pocket and the price is the best part...I DON'T EVER give 5 stars for a product. There is always something I can find on the negative side of things, but this PowerCore deserves every star on the review. The search is over. I will no longer by a charger that isn't Anker. Actually, after this review I realize I need to actually buy another one of these......I hope you get on board to share in the find of a lifetime. Thank you Anker!!!..Mark :-)",4
5.0,,"June 8, 2018",Yes,"Worked perfectly.  I brought this to a sports arena which drains battery like crazy when everyone is trying to send things constantly and clogs up the cell service.  Fit into my pocket great, just felt like i was carrying another phone  I was able to fill 2 different phones up twice each throughout the game and still had 25% in the bank at the end.  I don't travel without this thing now.",0
5.0,,"February 14, 2017",Yes,"READ this review before ordering!!.I originally purchased this one for myself, got it &amp; found it did not meet my expectations.  I had a different brand that I loved, holding a charge long enough to recharge my cell phone a few times along with my Kindle.  This 10000 model did not do that.  I contact Amazon to return, inwhich Anker contacted me &amp; wanted to know the reason for return.  Explained my expectations were not met &amp; wanted to return.  They noted I had purchased the 20100 earlier.  Told them I was rushed &amp; thought it was the same, or a bit cheaper.  Well, now looking back at models you can tell the 20100 appears 'bigger, more powerful'.  I told them weight wasn't a concern for packing around.  Looking for HOURS of recharging, since I camp a lot &amp; other brand did what I wanted, but died 5 months after getting.  They suggested reordering the 20100 &amp; explained it would do what I wanted.  I had gotten the first 20100 as a gift &amp; hadn't given it to my friend yet, so took them at their word..OH MY!!  It is EXACTLY what I wanted &amp; needed!!  They were very accommodating in helping me ~ MORE than I EVER asked or expected!!.Please know I am an ANKER fan &amp; will ONLY purchase their products from now on.  I have never had such GREAT customer service!!.I plan on purchasing one for my daughter this summer for her birthday!.PLEASE note that they carry an 18 month warranty on their products!!  How many places do that without purchasing an extended plan??.I think you will be happy with the 20100 time on recharging your items.  The 10000 only would recharge my S7 2 times, not enough for 5-6 days of camping... Heavier was MUCH better!!",3
5.0,,"June 24, 2017",Yes,"My son and I each purchased one of the battery packs. They were purchased for a vacation and were extremely helpful. The battery pack is able to charge our phones (Nexus 5x) completely ~3-4 times. It is nice not having to search desperately for a power outlet in every airport/shopping center/restaurant/tourist site/subway, etc. when away...The battery pack conveniently comes with a little mesh bag, which holds the charging cord in addition to a USB plug end for a wall outlet (USB plug-in end is not included... but the one for your phone works)...The size of the battery pack is actually very small, too. It is the size of a pack of playing cards...Absolutely no issues taking these through TSA scanners, or on planes, by the way...A nice feature is the button on the side. Pushing the button will show you the battery level... The pack has 4 LED lights, indicating charge level (1 to 4 lights will indicate level)...As usual, Anker products are extremely reliable, I have bought other products, including car chargers and USB charging stations. The products are extremely reliable at unbeatable prices.",3
5.0,,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"Perfect for school bags and power outages.  My son keeps this in his school bag in case he needs an extra charge on his tablet or cell phone, this takes up no room.  During a recent power outage this kept all 3 of the family cells on full charge for 2 days.",0
5.0,,"August 25, 2017",Yes,"Love this device. It's small and compact, charges my devices and phone super quick, and holds it's charge for a very long time. Comes with a great little bag that has enough room to hold an apple iPhone and mini USD charger cable. Great size and performance.",0
5.0,,"September 7, 2017",Yes,This charger is BY FAR the best out there. I'm a commuter and always on my iPhone constantly. I keep this in my purse for when i need it. It lasts me a good 3-4 FULL charges on my phone and charges it super quick! The charger itself takes a little while to fully charge 100%. But make sure you use the cord it comes with AND use a legit apple plug or whatever as long as its not one of those aftermarket plugs. It charges it in half the time!,0
5.0,,"September 15, 2017",Yes,"Light, portable and most important, it's very dependable.  It will charge one device at a time but it charges fast.  It has a large capacity so I was able to charge two different devices twice, 4 times total from 10% to full.  No more stressing on trips abroad or any travels.",0
5.0,,"January 13, 2019",Yes,Great for keeping my phone and tablet charged. I enjoy that it has it's own carrying case and core which is very convenient. I use this when I take trips from home or go on vacation and know I will not be able to gain access to an electrical outlet.,0
5.0,,"February 21, 2018",Yes,"This charger is by far my favorite portable device, as it can recharge an Iphone from 5% back to 100%, while using said phone. It has done this for me 3 times before having to recharge. At airports, I am surprised when people use random outlets to keep a charge on their phones. You have a 13 hour flight, this device will keep your phone charge without a problem. More importantly, it is highly compact.",0
5.0,,"October 25, 2017",Yes,"Took this bad boy on my trip to Hong Kong and i must say it was a life saver. Kept my phone charged thru out the day and took me about three days before i had to actually charge the battery pack. Lost count how many charges i got out of this. If you're a travel bug, love packing light but need efficiency this is the way to go!",0
1.0,,"March 22, 2019",Yes,"Used to be great. Then, after having it for one year, it completely died. Stopped charging. Just always has one blinking light. Would like a replacement.",0
5.0,,"July 12, 2018",Yes,"I bought this product in July 2017. I must say its an amazing compact power bank. However, 2 weeks back it stopped working. I contacted Anker customer care and they told me that power back is covered under warranty. Thanks to Sharon for helping me out and sending a new Powercore 10000 MaH. Anker after sales services are really good.",1
5.0,,"April 1, 2019",Yes,Maui flight was awesome because of this. Charged faster than airline plug and didn’t phase the battery life. Buy it for iPhone 6.,0
5.0,,"February 16, 2018",Yes,"I found this to be a great help. I have never had one, and on a recent trip decided I needed it.  It's great. I don't know why, but my phone charges much more quickly off of this then it does from anywhere else.  Very effective. Highly recommend.",0
2.0,,"September 23, 2018",Yes,"It was great in the beginning but now not even ten months in, it takes HOURS to recharge the backup. This is the second night I'm recharging it and it's still on the second light.",0
5.0,,"June 9, 2017",Yes,"Wow, saved my trip. About 2 100% charges for my iPhone 7 plus and super fast..And this battery pack is small!.Also comes in great packing. You must buy this.",1
5.0,,"October 10, 2016",Yes,I love this charger have charged my IPhone 6 at least 4 times from practically dead before even losing more than one of the 4 light charge indicators. (Charger tells you how much charge is left on a one to 4 light indicator. ) I purchased the Anker Dual USB wall charger power port plug that goes with this. It also chargers super quickly. So much better than a highly rated charger I previously purchased. Highly recommend!,0
4.0,,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"Works great. The battery lasts super long, like so far 3 weeks of charge if you use it sporadically every day to get a quick charge. It's a fast charge too. Compact enough for me...2 downsides so far, it takes forever for it to charge to full. I'm talking hours and hours. I have to leave it over night for it to charge completely.  The other downside or really scary thing is if you use a USB plug in unit to charge it, that unit will heat up so much. It got  to the point I got incredibly scared it was gonna catch fire. Instead I charge it via my laptop. I've used a couple different USB plug in units just to be sure and each one was burning hot. So caution! It just might be me but please pay attention and be careful...Oh and FYI, you can only charge it with the cable given to you. I tried it with another that fit perfectly and even though the light was blinking saying it was charging, it didn't charge for me...And yes I would recommend this to someone and buy another one if I had to.",12
5.0,,"November 20, 2017",Yes,"This has been a lifesaver when I'm mobile but need to make sure I still have cell phone battery. I get multiple charges out of the tiny box, and it charges itself fast, too. I'd highly recommend this particular portable charger to anyone.",0
5.0,,"December 23, 2018",Yes,Love this it's so perfect for the airplane!! 😍😍 I love anker brand and I have only had one defective item in the past from this brand.,0
5.0,,"September 23, 2016",Yes,"Charges my phone super quickly, up to approx. 4 battery charges for an old GS3. The charger itself charges in a reasonable amount of time. I love how little space it takes up, but how much battery power it backs. The only reason I'd deduct a .5 star is because it doesn't have another port to charge more than one phone at a time. Granted, the entire size of the power bank would likely be different if it did include another port...but it never hurts to dream! I always love going to Anker for my power needs and they have yet to disappoint. The carrying pouch included is also a nice touch!",0
5.0,,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"This is a great product. Charges my Note 5 3 times, quickly and has saved me several times. So good in fact, I bought a second one as a gift.",0
5.0,,"July 11, 2017",Yes,"This portable charger is awesome. Charges my iPhone several times without having to recharge the battery, and it's small and portable. Only downside is that it takes a while to charge and you can't charge your phone simultaneously. Not a dealbreaker for me though; this is much better than any other portable battery I've used before! Highly recommend.",1
5.0,,"November 27, 2016",Yes,So far So good.  My Moto Droid Turbo has a pretty large battery.  From what I can tell about early usage the PowerCore 10k should be able to fully charge my phone 2-4 times depending on whether or not I'm using phone.  Very handy during the holidays when using phone more often. Not bulky.  Smaller than most phones.,0
5.0,,"August 24, 2017",Yes,"This thing is great. I have used it to charge 4 phones at once and don't have to recharge it for 4 days. It does take some time to recharge, I will usually plug it in overnight before I need to use it. I feel like it charges faster than the wall plugs do!",0
5.0,,"March 28, 2019",Yes,Works great!.I have an iphone 8+ 256gb.This charger charges my phone a good 3 times before needeing to be recharged. Well worth it!,0
5.0,,"July 27, 2017",Yes,"Haven't had this very long so I can't speak to it's longevity, but it works great. It's small so it's easy to throw in a purse or bag for travel. It comes with a little thick mesh travel bag, which is great and keeps me from losing track of the cord. Definitely recommend and will probably buy another for my husband.",0
5.0,,"August 1, 2017",Yes,"I initially bought this for my husband and I to use on the go because he plays a lot of games on his phone, and it's always dying. This power bank is incredible. My phone was at 30% when I plugged this in to charge. I don't think it took more than 45 minutes to get a full charge on my phone. Absolutely love this product.",0
5.0,,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"My son got me a different lovely portable charger for my birthday, but it last 2 months before having connectivity issues. I got this to replace it and 2 months in it still does a spectacular job. I can use it for days of work before having to charge it.",0
5.0,,"August 21, 2016",Yes,"I haven't dropped it at all, girlfriend dropped it TWICE, it still works. If it breaks on the third drop, I would still give this 5 stars. Anker makes good products. I bought a mouse from them which was a disaster, but this product has been great.",1
4.0,,"November 19, 2017",Yes,I've only run a couple charges and was disappointed with how long it was taking to top off my LG G4. Turns out the cheap cables that come with this (and most other USB devices) were to blame. Be sure you have an assortment of quality cables and this will work just fine. Great price per mAmp.,0
5.0,,"May 21, 2018",Yes,It didn't last even 6 months and it's not working....----..UPDATE: Anker contacted me and as part of its quality service they replaced my old battery with a new one. So far the new one is working as expected...We'll have to wait and see how long will it last but for now I have to recognize their EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE and EXPEDITED REPLY,0
5.0,,"June 25, 2017",Yes,"When I received this product, which was packaged very well, I charged it up for the first time.  I have charged my phone several times using this and still has 1 bar of juice left!!  Great power bank to keep your phone or whatever running no matter where you are!  Great product!!",0
5.0,,"November 17, 2017",Yes,I bought this for a friend and am highly considering getting one myself (I already have a couple Anker portable batteries) but this one is SO small and incredibly portable. It's the perfect battery to carry around in a purse or a sling bag or a backpack.,0
5.0,,"June 8, 2017",Yes,Small but powerful charger. Sleek and modern design. Comes with a mesh bag and a charging cord. Provides fast charging for the Android device.,3
2.0,,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"After owning it for 2 months and using it for maybe a day a week. It suddenly stopped charging my phone. It would receive the charge but wont charge up my phone. No bueno. When it did work, it was great.",0
5.0,,"January 16, 2017",Yes,"I am really glad I got this. It recharges my phone. It allows me to use my phone while charging. It really helps when playing VR games. I have a ""pro"" level GPS on my phone, which has topo maps. This is handy for that. A computer LAN expert buddy of mine was very impressed with it. So am I...",0
5.0,,"September 5, 2017",Yes,Update: I’ve had the charger for two years with close to everyday use and it is still performing like it’s brand new...Anker continues to amaze me. This portable charger is a must have. It charges my phone and Ipad very fast and multiple charges.,0
5.0,,"February 28, 2018",Yes,i'm from the u.s. and used this extensively on a trip to asia and it performed perfectly. note that there is a button you must push on the side in order to get it to begin charging. i found that out inadvertently after thinking the powercore wasn't working!,0
5.0,,"February 25, 2019",Yes,"I do a lot of traveling for work and keep this gem in my carry on. It charges all of my gadgets VERY quickly. It has a micro USB port, comes with the cable you need to to charge it, and a small carrying case. Well designed and thoughtful  accessories.",0
5.0,,"May 16, 2018",Yes,I am a Realtor. I am on the phone all of the time on calls and/or the internet. This device has saved me so many times. I can charge my phone completely and still have charge left in the pack.,0
5.0,,"April 3, 2017",Yes,I bought this for my younger cousin for her birthday and she loves it! It's very lightweight and can fit in her very small crossbody purse very easily. It can also charge up her phone at least three times and it comes in really handy during Netflix marathons. I would definitely buy another one of these just to have a spare around for emergencies.,0
5.0,,"January 7, 2018",Yes,This portable charger has saved me and sometimes my friends so many times. This charger can fully charge my note 5 about 2 or 3 times (not sure because I usually recharge it before it actually runs out of charge). It's really small and fits in my pocket meaning I can take it anywhere. It comes with a small carrying pouch but i don't use it.,0
1.0,,"March 18, 2019",Yes,"The cord that comes with this charger will not fit my phone.  Apparently it is too small because when I plug it in, it simply falls out.  It's useless without the right sized plug.",0
5.0,,"September 17, 2017",Yes,"This little guy is awesome.  We used this on our trip to Disney World.  It lasted all day and actually charges your device faster than some of the wall chargers.  Very durable, yet lightweight and compact.  I highly recommend this product.",0
5.0,,"June 10, 2017",Yes,Another fanastic product by Anker.  It's a lot smaller than I though it would be.  It even has a nice mesh case.  Great products...- Maximo Caggiano,1
5.0,,"October 30, 2017",Yes,"Got this for my wife.  She loves it!  Holds a charge well.  Recharges her phone (BlackBerry Priv) quickly even when she is playing high-drain games such as Pokémon Go.  Small and lightweight compared to some others I have seen.  Get it, you won't be disappointed!",0
5.0,,"October 2, 2017",Yes,"This is my 2nd one, my first one was borrowed and surprisingly never came back.  I won't go anywhere without it...plenty of juice to handle iPhones and tablets and perfect size.  This is my go-to charger that I take camping and RV'ing.",0
5.0,,"February 3, 2019",Yes,Absolutely great for the price!.It's tiny but packs a good but of power!.No complaints with any Anker products so far!,0
5.0,,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"With 3 kids in all kinds of activities we are always on the move. This is so small and portable, but holds enough power to use it all week to recharge my phone. Very well constructed. I would not hesitate to purchase additional Anker products for larger needs.",0
5.0,,"March 10, 2019",Yes,We bought three of these portable chargers for Christmas gifts.  We had a problem with one of them not charging properly and the seller was very quick to respond and sent a new unit to replace the defective one.  All are working well so far.  Very pleased.,1
3.0,,"March 3, 2017",Yes,"It broke in the first few weeks. I have several Anker battery packs, and usually don't have any problem until I got this one model.",2
5.0,,"January 10, 2019",Yes,"solid battery pack that holds enough juice for a couple of recharges.  I like that it doesn't lose charge when it's unused, so I can keep it on me for emergencies.  Only drawback is it's a little heavy to fit in small clutches/purses, but I see that more of a tradeoff of how much charge it holds rather than poor construction",0
4.0,,"July 10, 2018",Yes,I really like the capacity of this charger and that I can fully charge my iphone more than once.  Just wish it wasn't so heavy - makes my purse weigh a ton.,0
5.0,,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"Not sure how I lived without this. It does take a while to fully recharge the pack, but I've learned to plug it in overnight and it will be fully juiced up by the morning. The pack itself is small and easy to carry around and can function to recharge your phone quickly or to help maintain the charge (and incrementally increase your battery percentage) while in use.",1
5.0,,"November 9, 2017",Yes,"I LOVE this external battery.  I've had it for about 2 months now.  It does take a long time to charge it from scratch to a full charge, but that's fine when you can charge your phone 4 or more times with it.  I take it on longer hikes with me, and also use it at my local sports bar when watching games and using my phone.  Anywhere I go where there is no where to plug in.  Excellent product.",0
5.0,,"April 18, 2019",Yes,I got this for my boyfriend who travels all the time for work. This has been a lifesaver for him and it works VERY well.,0
5.0,,"August 4, 2018",Yes,"I love this handy little battery pack. I love being free to charge my device wherever I want to, no outlet required! Can do 4+ full charges of my iPhone 7. Battery pack itself is light and easy to carry with you.",0
5.0,,"January 4, 2019",Yes,"By far, one of the best purchases I’ve made on this site. I use this thing daily. Dropped it a lot and in the snow. It’s still able to charge my iPhone fairly quickly.",0
5.0,,"March 30, 2017",Yes,"I use many products with a battery, iPhone, iPod, headphones. I always need to charge them while on the go. A couple batteries I had weren't holding a charge anymore so I got these anker batteries. They are small but are 10000ma!!!! This is enough to charge my phone multiple times and even charge my iPad fully!!! It's so compact it fits in my pocket.",0
3.0,,"May 5, 2017",Yes,**edit- they were actually kind enough to reach out to me and replace the unit. Hopefully this second one will last longer. They were very quick and followed up with me to make sure I received the replacement quickly...I got this in January and it died in May. It's started off working so well and being so handy but now the lights just keep blinking (like other reviews have also said) and the unit won't charge or charge my phone no matter what cords I try with it. Waste of money. I travel a lot for work and it is a real shame to have to replace this already.,7
5.0,,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"I'm satisfied with this external battery because it's light weight, small, and it charges my iPhone quick. The external battery itself takes some time to charge but once it's fully charged it can charge my iPhone about 6 times (give or take) before it needs to be charged again, which I think is pretty good and I am happy with.",0
4.0,,"September 24, 2017",Yes,"Charged my phone four times within two days and still had two bars of energy on it. A few minor cons that may be user error.  1st one is that it takes a few trys to get it to start charging. I usually have to turn it off and on again to get phone started on charging (could be my cord, hence the user error suggestion.) 2nd con is that I wish it was more lighter. Not easy for me to carry around when traveling. It's bulky and has some weight on it. Would still buy again!",0
5.0,,"October 4, 2017",Yes,this charger has held its charge for a few months and has been a nice addition to my travels allowing  for multiple full charges on my iphone,1
3.0,,"January 4, 2019",Yes,I bought this product back in September of 2018 and it stopped charging after 3 months of use. I initially loved this product it charged my iPhone completely. It definitely saved my life when traveling and when  on the go. Wish it would of lasted longer.,1
5.0,,"January 4, 2017",Yes,"Used this for a international flight of 11 hrs.  Was so nice to arrive at our destination with a full charge.  Small enough to fit in a medium/large pocket.  Battery is capable of multiple charges, not sure how many, but at least 4. Seems pretty well made.  I have suggested it to a few friends that were going on long international flights and they all love them also.",0
5.0,,"April 16, 2019",Yes,"Amazing charger. Charged 2 of our phones completely and still had room for more!  I read other reviews that said it’s thin and lightweight. I found it to be a bit on the bulky and heavy side. That being said, it’s charging power has won me over!",0
5.0,,"December 12, 2017",Yes,Small (fits comfotably in your pocket).  Gets you through the day no matter how long you use your phone. Works great with my Galaxy S8 +,1
5.0,,"July 15, 2017",Yes,"Very convenient.  Works great..When my phone battery is low and I need to be outside, I plug the phone into this and do my outside chores.",1
5.0,,"January 4, 2019",Yes,"I've had mine for quite a while now, I used it when I delivered Pizza and it was suuuuch a life saver. It could charge my Galaxy S7 two or three times before needing to be charged itself, and it's still kickin today for my Galaxy S9.",0
4.0,,"October 17, 2016",Yes,During an unlucky day at school my old portable charger was stolen..After a fluke with a poorly made one from another company my brother recommended Anker and I figured it'd be worth a shot..Exceeded my expectations and my co-workers are amazed at how fast it charges my phone even to the point to where they ask to buy it off of me..Instead I tell them who makes the product and where to find them.,2
5.0,,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"Don't know what else to say.  If you want a portable  battery bank that can fit in pockets,purses,ect and also fast charges.  Then this is the device for you.  Honestly one of these should be on or near you at all times.",0
5.0,,"February 26, 2017",Yes,"High quality construction.  Compact.  Not too heavy.  Charges my Galaxy S7 2-1/2 to 3 times.  A nice feature is the small blue lights in a row.  When they stop blinking, the unit is full charged.  For example, if 2 lights are blinking then the unit is not fully charged.  Comes with its own cable and a nice woven small black bag with a draw string and clasp.  The unit and the cable fit easily into the bag.  This is very convenient for travel.  Anker makes good quality products and this is no exception.  I took the time to write this review, because I spent a lot of time researching these kinds of units before I bought. I hope this review saves time for others.",0
5.0,,"December 16, 2017",Yes,"Works great for any phone, holds about 3-4 charges for an iPhone 6S. Use it for camping and festivals!",1
4.0,,"December 18, 2017",Yes,I really like this battery backup.  It lasts a long time and I haven't seen it's battery life decline at all yet.  The only downside is that it doesn't do fast charging on my Galaxy.  It charges pretty quickly despite that.,0
5.0,,"April 17, 2017",Yes,"Light is not a word that I would use to describe this charger.  But it works well and feels very solidly built, like everything else Anker makes. So far, I have been able to charge my 3+ year old Galaxy S4, from 0 to 100 percent, three times off of a single PowerCore charge.",0
5.0,,"March 30, 2017",Yes,I am excited with this product. It works great and as advertised I use it everywhere when my phone is low on batteries or my IPad. I have various Anker products including cords and they work great. I recommend this product and the Anke line of products you won't be disappointed.,0
5.0,,"March 28, 2017",Yes,"This charger is so powerful! I've purchased four because the charger is so convenient while traveling and working in areas where an outlet isn't convenient. In the latest evidence of its outstanding performance, I started using the charger around 4:00pm yesterday while waiting at the airport for a flight, left the phone charging for the duration of the flight (4 hours in flight), all night and until around 3:00pm today and the charger still had one bar (weak but still blinking). I am contemplating buying another one! I have several different models of chargers, this is unequivocally the best performing hands down!",0
5.0,,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"I love this battery pack! Very compact, fits easily in your pocket. Charges my iPhone 7 FAST, and can recharge it fully at least three times. A must have for traveling!",0
5.0,,"November 29, 2016",Yes,"Charge your phone twice on a single battery you technophile! Or charge your phone, and a friend's phone(after yours of course) because thats what friends do. Its about the size of an iPhone 5s with a think case on it, but it comes with a bag to keep the USB-micro USB cable (bring your own lightning cable) with the battery.",0
5.0,,"September 30, 2016",Yes,"I'm always wary of my phone dying while I'm out, especially at festivals or the beach. Ever since I got this though, I haven't had those worries. It takes a while to fully charge but then holds a charge for a very long time, more than enough to recharge your phone and some friends'. The cover it comes with is really convenient for storing it and a charger cable in your purse on the go.",1
5.0,,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"I carry this everywhere with me and it's saved me countless times from dead phones. It comes with a nice mesh pouch and is small enough to carry in my purse, though it's a bit heavy (naturally, as it's a battery). Would def recommend.",0
5.0,,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"These worked fantastic for an on-the-go vacation.  Charges really fast, and you can get 3-4 charges before you have to charge it again.  Great product and fits nicely in a purse or even a pocket if needed!",0
5.0,,"September 11, 2017",Yes,"After losing another ""borrowed"" power block at work, I decided to switch to carrying a power bank with me and the Anker PowerCore has been awesome. I get several full charges off it, so it works great while traveling...It's small, easy to carry and rapidly charges my phone.",0
5.0,,"May 2, 2017",Yes,"This is very nice, it keeps lots of battery on to pass to your cellphone and even have extra for my ipad. I love it and recommend it to anyone who needs a backup charging device for cellphone or ipad, or both like me. It's a little expensive but good quality so it's worth it.",0
5.0,,"July 25, 2017",Yes,This is the second one I bought this charger and it is truly amazing! I have quick charging anywhere I go since I can fit it in almost any pocket. When I have the charger fully charged i can fully charge my iphone 7 two time over! Wonderful product for a great price. Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone!,0
5.0,,"August 14, 2017",Yes,This item in amazing.  It can recharge my phone in less than two hours.  It is small enough to fit in my purse easily.  I listen to audible books often when walking my dog and now there is never a time that I have no power.  Great buy!,0
5.0,,"June 4, 2018",Yes,Amazing company and products. Customer service extremely responsive and helpful. they've easily sent me a replacement battery when my purchased one died. Highly recommend them ! Thank you Anker team for a really great experience.,0
5.0,,"April 10, 2017",Yes,So far so good.  We ordered this for our upcoming Disney trip and just received it last week.  It was packaged very professionally.  I plugged it in to try it out and it charged my phone fine.  I think this will end up being a great purchase.  With 3 tweens/teens - it will get a workout!,0
5.0,,"December 26, 2018",Yes,"wouldn't go camping or hiking without one of these when I had my iPhone 5 - the phone battery died quickly and the phone would crash when i used the camera, so carrying this around everywhere was a must. It was light and convenient",0
5.0,,"February 7, 2019",Yes,This battery fits easily in a purse or briefcase. It is lightweight and holds its charge for a long time. It is very useful when traveling or just to have if your phone battery drains.,0
5.0,,"July 2, 2018",Yes,"I used this product for a 2 week trip throughout the UK. As the primary driver for my group, I was always using my phone for GPS directions, as well as just general increased use than normaly. Not to mention the 8 hour flights there and back. I used this product every day and at 10k milliamps, there was more than enough juice to keep my Galaxy S8 charged up every day.",0
5.0,,"April 13, 2019",Yes,"Love this battery. Charges up quickly and then charges up my phone perfectly...For a day out with the family, this is great. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, but has enough power to fill my phone almost three times (or fill mine and then pass to my wife).",0
5.0,,"April 1, 2018",Yes,"I use this portable charger as my everyday carry portable charger but primiarily I use it for school. It has not failed me since I first got it. It is incredibly light and very small (as small as a credit card), it even comes with a nifty carrying pouch that can fit the portable charger and a cable. After use, I simply recharge overnight with the overall charging time not exceeding 4 hours. I would recommend this to anyone who drains their phone battery quite often and needs a very versitle and portable charger.",0
5.0,,"March 20, 2017",Yes,"I've bought a few other brands over the past few months. 1 big named charger stopped working after 4 days, the other don't charge so well. This anker... I should of just bought a couple of these to begin with. The charger itself charges quick, it's lightweight, and does a great job charging my phone all day. I will be buying another for my son very soon.",0
5.0,,"January 3, 2017",Yes,"I bought two of these for Christmas gifts and so far, we've been delighted with them. The size was what attracted me, and we both just tossed them in our duffle bag for traveling - they took up no room! Charging them and using them to charge our devices couldn't be easier! thanks for a great product!",0
5.0,,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I absolutely love my 10000 Anker powerCore ! I bought  it in 2016. Still going strong! Very light, compact , durable charger! Definitely recommend this product!",0
5.0,,"May 4, 2017",Yes,"I was spending a relaxing weekend with a friend when the power ""died""! My cell phone was almost gone too, so my friend introduced me to the Anker PowerCore. I live in a rural area where the electricity often goes out. So comforting to know that I can charge my cell phone when this occurs..I purposely did not put batteries in ... will wait for another power surge! Very handy gadget, and thanks to my friend, Pat, for enlightening me!",0
5.0,,"September 27, 2017",Yes,Possibly one of the best portable chargers I've ever used and very cost efficient. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a portable charger although you can go higher as far as charging goes this is perfect for someone who just needs it to charge there phone on a day by day basis. I'm a high school student so I'll need it around 6th period because the battery life of my phone is terrible but this charger can charge my phone 2x over easily. Definitely amazing and perfect for me or most people in that matter,0
1.0,,"October 15, 2018",Yes,"I charged it to 4 indicator dots. It NEVER worked! I was vacationing in Italy, i called customer service and the rep said, “I guess you’ll have to deal with it when you get home.” I just arrived home to the US to find out my return window has expired. Lesson learned, never again!",0
3.0,,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"Worked great for about a year, then all of a sudden just stopped working completely. No matter how long I kept it charging, the moment I disconnected it from power it would go off, and could not charge my phone anymore. Was so disappointed that I only got a year's worth out of it. For the year that it worked, it worked great. Took a while to fully charge up, but once it was it would quickly charge my phone. Very convenient especially when traveling or in a location I couldnt get to a power outlet.",0
5.0,,"December 2, 2018",Yes,Have tried many portable chargers and they all get the job done once and then die. This one holds a charge exceptionally well. I can fully charge my phone about 3-4 times with this device before having to plug it in for recharge. It does take a while once you have to plug it in to get back up to full - but it’s worth it since you won’t have to do it again as frequently as others. Definitely recommend it.,0
5.0,,"August 30, 2018",Yes,Great. Holds its own charge for a long time. Portable. Like the case it has. It can’t be helped but its heavy. That doesn’t stop me from taking it every where I go.,0
2.0,,"March 25, 2017",Yes,"First time using it was traveling to Singapore.  Fully charged device did not last 4 days.  Disappointed, will return.",2
5.0,,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"Great product. Maintains the power charge as stated. Charges the phone efficiently. Very small  and compact,easy to carry",0
5.0,,"July 15, 2017",Yes,"Probably the best portable battery charger on the market. While cheap in price, it's actually super sturdy. Keeps your devices alive for the entire day.",1
5.0,,"April 15, 2018",Yes,"This is truly an excellent travel companion. I had an older power bank that was at least three times as heavy. This is a light, small and quite portable. I have a big phone and was able to charge it three times without charging the PowerCore.  I highly recommend this especially for travel or those often on the road.",0
5.0,,"September 20, 2016",Yes,This little external Anker charger is a marvel. I love it. I've used it 3 times since I got it and it powered my phone and e-cigarette FAST... It's also extremely easy to carry (I bought a hard case for it as well and it fits so easily in my bag). I've never gone wrong with Anker products and will continue to buy and use them. I'm content.,0
5.0,,"February 2, 2019",Yes,"Once I figured out how to use it, it was great.... A grandchild had to show this 69 year old grandmother!! I used at Disney World, because my phone was out of charge by noon, from all the pictures and videos I was taking.",0
4.0,,"December 13, 2018",Yes,Very good!! It takes a long time to charge it back up.. but once it is charged and you plug it to your phone it will charge your phone pretty quickly. You cannot charge your phone and the Anker at the same time.. i leave the anker to charge overnight and it is perfect for my needs in the day.,0
5.0,,"October 11, 2018",Yes,"Didn't use as much as I thought I would (eventually bought a new phone), but when I did use it, it did lengthened my phone's battery life quite a bit, which was great Fri playing pokemon go and the walking dead game.",0
5.0,,"January 30, 2017",Yes,"I brought this with me to the Women's March, which was a huge battery drain, as a test-run for an upcoming trip where electricity will be sparse. I was able to fully charge my phone quickly several times, over a couple of days. Very happy with this purchase.",1
5.0,,"January 4, 2018",Yes,This is a great product.  Charges my iPhone multiple times (quickly) on a single charge.  Perfect for travel and those times where youre running out the door and realize your phone isnt charged.,0
2.0,,"March 25, 2017",Yes,this thing was great for the first month that I had it.  it's pretty small and light and charged my phone many times before i had to recharge it.  but now after one month it has stopped working.  the blue lights light up but don't blink and it will not charge my phone or take a charge.  i guess i'm going to try and warranty it.,2
1.0,,"October 14, 2018",Yes,"I Purchased this charger and I originally loved it until I lost the anker micro usb cable it came with,, I can no lobger charge this device since other micro usb cables don't charge it. On the device it shows its charging because the blue light is blinking but when I check on it hours later it is still on the same level. So stupid that other micro usbs don't work with this device",0
4.0,,"July 5, 2018",Yes,"I ordered the black Anker and received a red one instead, but it’s not much of an issue. It’s very light and compact (my hands are very small, and I included a photo for scaling). It charged pretty quickly using the included cable &amp; my own adapter, and it seems to be charging my phone well. The only complaint I have is that there is a tight fit in the USB and charging ports. Other than that, I will have to test the Anker for when I need to have my phone fully recharged.",0
5.0,,"October 12, 2017",Yes,"One recharge lasts a loooong time! Small, compact, easy to use, I like the cushiony case it comes with. No complaints, exactly what I needed for my iphones. I wanted something hardy that is no fuss, this is great.",0
5.0,,"September 28, 2017",Yes,Anker PowerCare 1000 is small and light enough to carry with me in my purse.  I like it's quick charge - it was ready to use in just a few hours.  .I also liked that it came with a black mesh bag so I have a place to keep it somewhat safe.,0
5.0,,"December 5, 2017",Yes,"The size of this power block is awesome. It's small, compact and you barely know you have it with you. Holds plenty of charge for me to recharge my phone 2-3 times before I have to recharge the PowerCore.",0
5.0,,"December 15, 2017",Yes,"Works really well! I just wish it charged via USB-C, since my devices use USB-C and having to carry a micro USB wire around for one device is kind of a hassle. I can't tell you how many times I've grabbed two USB-C or two micro USB wires by accident and been unable to charge on the go.",0
4.0,,"September 30, 2017",Yes,"It's excellent battery, good for several iPhone charges.  I wish it weren't as heavy, and I wish it didn't require two cables (one for charging the battery, one for charging the iPhone or iPad).  But I do appreciate having the battery.",0
5.0,,"August 7, 2017",Yes,"This item is great! charges all of my devices super well, and based on the ammount of times i've dropped it, super durable too! Only downside is it charges slowly, but that's because it's got so much battery! I love it and recommend it to my friends all the time",0
5.0,,"August 2, 2017",Yes,"This is a great power charger for on the go. It is small enough to put into your pocket or purse and not weigh it down. It charges our cell phones great. We took it to Disneyland and never ran out of charge after being there all day, for two phones.",0
4.0,,"February 5, 2018",Yes,"So far I am pleased with my Ankor PowerCore. I wanted a smaller, lighter iPhone charger to carry in my purse. This works fine for that purpose. It only took 2 or 3 hours to fully charge. For me, that is not very long. It also charges my iPhone fully 2 or 3 times before I have to recharge it. One note of import—I have had this charger only a couple of weeks. I’m giving it 4 stars only because I haven’t had it very long, otherwise 5 stars.",0
5.0,,"April 2, 2017",Yes,"THis has saved me so many times! It works great, holds charge for a long time without requiring charging of the unit itself, and can resuscitate my phone pretty quickly. It's small enough to be conveniently thrown into my pocketbook. I've actually bought this for several friends",0
5.0,,"August 3, 2018",Yes,Best power bank I have ever used. It works great day in and day out. Got me through a 5 night music festival charging my apple watch and 2 Juuls.,0
5.0,,"April 6, 2018",Yes,I LOVE IT! My hubbys andriod phone was on 46% so I plugged this baby and Walah 5 min later is on 76% WOWZA!!!!!!!!!!! So worth of the price. 😍😍😍 Thank you Anker. I’m super satisfied with my order 😎,0
5.0,,"July 4, 2017",Yes,"Small, compact, lots of reserve power for charging devices before you have to recharge the PowerCore. Would love to see these made in USB C charging ports for rapid charge of the primary battery. It uses a MicroUSB port to charge the primary battery.",0
5.0,,"July 25, 2018",Yes,I’ve had it for over two weeks now and I’ve been charging my phone after lunch for almost every day (mon-fri) and it hasn’t died! Awesome and compact charger!,0
3.0,,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"The battery pack is very light and portable and has the quality I would expect from Anker.  I was a liitle surprised by how long it takes to fully get charged (6.5 hrs.).  However, the charge does last quite a while and quickly charged my iphone.",0
5.0,,"February 27, 2019",Yes,But this for my husband who is always draining his battery cuz he never learns to close down apps lol,0
5.0,,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"Purchased these before a hurricane and helped us navigate our power outages while keeping our phones charged. Liked them so much, we tossed in the bag when we went to Disney world a few weeks later!",0
3.0,,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"I would have given this charger more stars BUT it does not work with Apple products without an additional apple compatible power cord.  The ""jack"" on the charger is not Apple compatible nor is the enclosed cord.  We made it work by adding the additional cord, but we have to carry 2, one to charge the phone/ipad and one to charger the  charger.  The directions &amp; descripton could have made that clearer.",1
5.0,,"August 25, 2018",Yes,"I'm thrilled with my Anker PowerCore 10000. I work internationally, primarily by telephone, so it's critical that my phone stay charged and that I can be mobile while it is charging. This battery is powerful and efficient. Charge times as advertised. Highly recommend.",0
5.0,,"August 12, 2017",Yes,"It charges my phone with a 3900 mAh battery fairly quickly. Probably not as quickly as the charger that came with the phone, but much faster than using a standard charger, and especially just plugging it into a computer.",0
1.0,,"September 19, 2018",Yes,"out of nowhere. like, it worked at least four times, and then i tried to charge it, left it on the charger overnight, and it never worked again. i paid like 40 bucks for this. i'm livid.",0
5.0,,"May 24, 2018",Yes,"Very pleased with my purchase!  I was able to charge mi iPhone8 AND my girlfriend's Android both from 50% battery, and my Anker still had 3 out of 4 dots worth of power left!",0
5.0,,"December 15, 2017",Yes,"Charges really quick. Holds a charge for a while (I've tested up to a week). Relatively light compared to the size. I carry it around mostly in my backpack, but it's not too bad having it in my purse.",0
2.0,,"September 23, 2018",Yes,I've bought it for my own usage and have had it less than 3 months and the USB cord that came with this portable charger stopped working &amp; charging. Will not be buying this product in the future.,0
5.0,,"February 17, 2019",Yes,once again anker does it again. They are amazon secret weapon in electronics . I you buy anker you will be happy. Great stuff,0
5.0,,"May 21, 2018",Yes,This is so handy!  I never have to worry about my phone or tablet going dead if I forget to charge it.  I carry it in my purse all the time.  I've even helped friends who needed a quick charge.,0
5.0,,"January 21, 2019",Yes,The charge lasts for so many charges!! I take this with me everywhere and only have to charge it once a week!!!,0
5.0,,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"Originally purchased to keep the phones and GoPro charged up during a long road trip. It worked very well, charging all devices, multiple times, on a single charge. Use it almost every day to keep my phone charged up.",0
1.0,,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"Stopped working after only one use. I have the larger one, and bought this one for someone as a gift because I had constantly told them how much of a lifesaver mine is. Go figure it stopped working after one use. I’m pissed, what a waste of hard earned money!",0
5.0,,"September 24, 2018",Yes,"The product holds together very well, although it is made out of a plastic feeling material it is still super small and has a great long lasting battery. I’m happy i purchased this specific power bank.",0
5.0,,"February 3, 2019",Yes,This power bank holds a lot of charge and is perfect for traveling or everyday use when you can’t plug in.,0
1.0,,"August 30, 2018",Yes,"Stopped working after a few months. Worked well while it functioned, but for thr price, I expect to get a few year's use out of this.",0
5.0,,"December 22, 2018",Yes,"I absolutely love this! I bought this to take on vacation to Assateague island and it really came in handy! Since then I've used it almost every day and it never disappoints! It does a fantastic, fast job of charging my Samsung phone even if the battery is dead. Well worth it!",0
5.0,,"March 15, 2019",Yes,Anker products are always great. This device is no exception. I have been using it literally every day.,0
5.0,,"December 13, 2016",Yes,I love this product. It does exactly what it's supposed to and does it well. You can put it in your pocket and forget it. No more looking for charging stations. This charger gives you the freedom that you need while traveling or just sitting on the couch st home. I would recommend this product to anyone. Can't beat it for the price.,0
5.0,,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"this saved my life on vacation! My friend and i both bought these, and we didn't have to fight over plugs when charging our phones, or if there were no outlets by the bed, we could charge at night,",0
5.0,,"November 29, 2018",Yes,Only buy Anker. Reason: quality of product and it does what it says it’ll do. Is there any more to say?,0
5.0,,"February 13, 2017",Yes,This little device is simply amazing. I bought it to take with me on my trip to Asia. It charges fully overnight and then has enough charge to recharge two phones plus! And it does it at a rapid speed. It was so great that I let my daughter keep it who traveled on and I bought myself a second one when I got back home.,0
5.0,,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"So bad ass! Does exactly what it says! I can charge my iPhone from zero to hero at-least 3 times. I like how small it is!..BUY THIS ONE NOW, don't wait till you have to buy one at the airport for crazy prices!",0
4.0,,"June 13, 2018",Yes,Worked until it needed to be recharged. It failed to recharge and now does not work. An expensive paperweight. I would not recommend this product..Update - AnkerDitect Customer Support immediately contacted me after my negative review of the Anker PowerCore 10000 offering a replacement and suggesting use of a different wall charger which I did. The PowerCore is charging fully with a different wall charger. A four star rating is now my review!,0
5.0,,"September 25, 2018",Yes,This thing is awesome. I can charge my Galaxy Note 8 at least two full charges with a single charge on this battery. Highly recommend.,0
4.0,,"January 14, 2019",Yes,I don't use this very often but it's done a pretty good job everytime I've used it. I can use it very conveniently when I have to take a trip somewhere over a weekend and there are not that many outlets readily available. The chord they provide you is pretty flimsy and short so I recommend using a different one.,0
5.0,,"May 30, 2017",Yes,"First time that I received a product that actually weighs less than the advertised price.  Since I use this to recharge my iPhone and watch I needed minimal weight.  The advertised weight is correct if you include the mesh packaging and cable but bare as I will carry it, it weighs 3/4ths of an ounce less at 6.3 oz's!  Every ounce counts when you are hiking 12 or 13 miles each day.",0
5.0,,"April 3, 2018",Yes,This thing is great!  Took it to a school trip to D.C. where we were not going to be able to charge.  I didn't even get close to using it all.  So glad I bought this.  So much better than the little one I had.,0
5.0,,"June 8, 2017",Yes,"Awesome power bank. Works great, small size and can be kept in very limited space as well which I like. I would definitely recommend.",1
5.0,,"January 6, 2017",Yes,"I love my little anker powercore charger. I pop it in my purse and go, never worrying about being able to charge my devices.  I have a larger anker charger which I also like. But I will get more use from the littler one. I havent timed how long it takes to charge my devices but doesnt seem that long.",0
5.0,,"May 23, 2017",Yes,Great product once again. I am an Anker fan all the way and this is just another reason why - they always work great and they provide excellent customer service.,1
5.0,,"September 28, 2017",Yes,I didn't realize how much I needed this until I got it. The charge holds up all day after a full charge. I refills my phone (samsung galaxy s7) very fast.  Great product. I have recommended it to many others.,0
5.0,,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"I like that it feels like a solid piece of electronics without being overly bulky or heavy. It charges my Samsung Galaxy S6 in less than 2 hours (awesomely efficient). I use it to keep my phone charged at school, work, on the bus, or going on a vacation. Anker seems like a good company I can get behind. If and when I purchase another mobile power bank, Anker will be it.",0
4.0,,"December 31, 2018",Yes,"It feels nice, kinda chunky for a pocket,.gets the girls through the day, charges phones well",0
5.0,,"May 15, 2018",Yes,"I've been using this for almost a year, including over the course of a 3 month bike trip. Usually holds 3-4 full charges for my iPhone 5 SE. Still works great! Happy customer.",0
5.0,,"February 8, 2018",Yes,BEST portable charger HANDS DOWN! Will fully charge at least 3 phones! It is small and compact! My son loves it because it's red and he knows which one is his because we own three!,0
5.0,,"July 12, 2018",Yes,I use it for my Samsung Galaxy S8. It takes a while to charge the power bank itself. It charges my phone very quickly. I charge it about 50% when I need to and it lasts several charges doing it that way.,0
5.0,,"April 27, 2017",Yes,"My Anker is the best product ever. I love this battery it holds charge for a while and can charge multiple devices, given you aren't using the device like an iPad or something while it's charging, without having to recharge the battery itself. This is my baby and it fits in my pocket. Never leave home without it.",0
5.0,,"July 6, 2018",Yes,I can power up my phone and tablet with this charger. It is small but mighty! Comes in a mesh draw string bag that holds the cord and charger. I love it. Highly recommend this product.,0
5.0,,"October 9, 2018",Yes,Power bank capacity and battery life is good . Whenever i am going for travelling . I used to charge fully and i can charge my couple of phones . After charging fully . it stays 2-3days .,0
4.0,,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"2 months in:..It's a great portable power bank. Small, compact and resilient. I have gone 3 or 4 nights in a row using this to charge my phone while I slept...Only problem I've had with this is that one of the indicator lights have gone out and it's hard to tell sometimes how many charges it has left...Other than that, I highly recommend this product",1
5.0,,"December 26, 2018",Yes,"I can charge my cell phone over 4 times on one charge of this battery.  The only downside, if there is one, is it's a little heavy for my running pack.  But rather than be stranded on a run, I'll gladly bear the extra weight.",0
5.0,,"December 12, 2016",Yes,"I'm very pleased with my Anker Power core 10,000. I feel secure knowing I have a portable charger that will charge my Samsung Galaxy S7 3 times if needed. This is lighter weight than one I have that has less power. Love the way technology is improving so quickly. I am totally spoiled to having my power bank charged &amp; ready for use. This was shipped &amp; received on the scheduled dates.",1
5.0,,"May 12, 2017",Yes,"Honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made. This thing is compact, but can charge my phone about 4 times. It charges fast, it looks cool, and it's super portable. The cable it comes with is a little skimpy, but it still works super well. I will recommend this for eternities.",0
5.0,,"February 18, 2018",Yes,"This pack does a fantastic job powering a Nintendo Switch through a day of travel. I wasn't satisfied with the options available for battery cases, so I've used a bit of Velcro and a short USB cable for a solution that stays completely out of the way of hands.  The small size makes a nice fit behind the system, and the reasonable weight doesn't make it exhausting to hold.",0
5.0,,"May 25, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for 9 day cruise, and now will never travel any kind of distance without it! This thing charges as fast as a wall charger, and I can usually get 3 full battery charges out if it on my galaxy s7.",0
5.0,,"July 26, 2018",Yes,"I’ve boughten 3 of these for myself and family members. The size is perfect and packs a lot of juice in them, they charge my phone in good time without the bulkiness of a big charge pack, 5 stars.",0
5.0,,"August 25, 2017",Yes,There's so many of these out there it was hard to choose from. So I bit the bullet and bought this one. To my surprise it works really well and charges fast and last pretty darn long. I'd recommend this to anyone.,0
5.0,,"October 3, 2018",Yes,i have used this for a few months and it has given me consistently good service. charges quickly and i havent seen any negative affects to my devices. definitely would recommend to family and friends.,0
5.0,,"July 13, 2018",Yes,"Anker rocks. The finest quality. I have 4 of these, rotate them for phones/tablets and they charge up fast and recharge my gear even faster.",0
5.0,,"June 5, 2017",Yes,"This is the best portable charger we've had for the size And amount of charge it holds. We took this all over Japan for two weeks and were able to keep our phones charged all day taking turns. I use it almost daily now, since my car charger has been acting up. So 7 months of regular use and it's still going strong!",0
5.0,,"March 2, 2018",Yes,I bought this for airline or other travel. Whenever my Cell battery is low I pull this out of my carry on and plug it in. It is just like being plugged in to power. Works great so far.,0
5.0,,"August 8, 2018",Yes,Super fast shipping.  These chargers fit in my purse perfectly without taking up too much room.  Nice to have on hand in case of a power outage.,0
5.0,,"June 18, 2017",Yes,"Absolutely awesome for keeping your phone of iPad charged throughout the day regardless of your use.  This is a definite must for high-use Android phones.  Thank you, Anker for applying your universal connection concept to spare batteries!",0
3.0,,"August 31, 2017",Yes,"I mean it'll charge your phone. It's ratio to needing vs delivering charge seems very uneven. I'll spend all night charging this thing on a turbo charged outlet and get from 30% to 100% but it will immediately die afterwards. Not bad, not great. I learned to just keep it in my bag in case I'm caught without an outlet.",0
4.0,,"November 9, 2018",Yes,This thing packs some power. Great for pokemon go. Wish they were a bit smaller but then again it would hold less of a charge.,0
5.0,,"August 10, 2017",Yes,"I don't even use the wall anymore, just charge this baby and take her with me everywhere I go to shoot and film. A must...I ran into some issues and Anker straightened them out quickly! Recommend this product!",0
5.0,,"December 17, 2017",Yes,"I have no real issues with this battery. it will charge my phone (s7 edge) around 2 or more times. The charge rate seems equivalent to a 2 amp wall adapter. This battery takes more then a few hours to charge. It is definitely convenient to have, especially for the charge capacity and size.",0
5.0,,"December 29, 2016",Yes,"Bought an inferior battery at what I thought was a good price as a gift. Price was so good I bought one for myself. Well, when they arrived I tested mine, which didn't work. Being that the other was a gift for Christmas,  I was worried that the other one would be junk as well. Did some research on Amazon and found the Anker. Bought one as a gift and one for myself. Not disappointed at all!  Received them promptly and they worked excellent!  I have used mine to charge my iPhone and iPad and it still had 2 leds showing. Very impressed!",0
5.0,,"October 30, 2016",Yes,"The Best I've used and I DID NOT receive anything for saying this! Went on a two day river trip and it kept me charging for the trip and for a week after I returned. Amazing! I don't know if I just got an exceptional unit, but I couldn't be happier with it exceeding my expectations.",0
5.0,,"May 7, 2017",Yes,"I have only had good experience with Anker products. I am astounded at how small and light this 10,000 mAhr power is. It has worked very reliably for me. I have used it quite often.",1
5.0,,"August 22, 2018",Yes,Compact and looks stylish.  Works great and comes with a small cloth carry case!  Great product that charges my iPhone when needed!,0
5.0,,"May 22, 2018",Yes,This is definitely as small as a credit card and it charges much faster than normal battery packs that you find at the store and can definitely charge your phone more than once (comes with a small bag to put it in and a micro cable to charge the battery pack,0
1.0,,"March 28, 2019",Yes,"I've always had a hard time charging this external battery, and today it stopped taking any charge at all. After I plug it in, 2 blue lights are on while the 3rd one flashes. After a few minutes, all of the lights turn off. Sometimes 3 lights stay turned on and none of them flash to indicate it's charging. This product is unusable now.",0
5.0,,"December 26, 2017",Yes,Works awesome and charges phone several times. I don't charge to 100% usually but it lasts a few charges. Very convenient!  Huge life saver. It's always in my purse unless charging.,0
5.0,,"October 1, 2017",Yes,The best thing I have ever bought. For the money it's incredible. Charges anything and when I hook it to my Galaxy s6 it's fast charging. I have 0 complaints and I write this 8 months after I have owed it.  Used DAILY,0
5.0,,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"I travel allot , this power pack charges my iPhone 3-4 times to 100% fairly quickly I might add before needing to be recharged.  This is by far the best portable charger I have purchased.. I have not tried it on my iPad or my computer..",0
5.0,,"February 22, 2017",Yes,These are a go to gift for friends and an absolute must for traveling. Anker has been a fantastic brand I've enjoyed for 5 years now. Love how light and small this new model is! I use these for when we're on the road for days at at the with no outlets it's awesome.,0
5.0,,"September 20, 2017",Yes,"I've had this about 6 months and so far it's been great! I have an iphone 6 for work and an iphone SE for personal and i charge both of them as needed. I've probably recharged this 20 times now and it's been working great for me [knock on wood]. What i do love about it, is that it charges my phones super fast. I can probably get a full charge in under 40 minutes if i'm not messing with my phone while charging!",0
5.0,,"May 7, 2018",Yes,I’ve charged this thing up several times and use it about everyday because there aren’t many accessible outlets in my house. It is small enough to carry in my purse or pocket.,0
5.0,,"September 15, 2016",Yes,"I love this thing. I can charge my Samsung S7 at least 1.5 times quickly and easily. It had no trouble charging my phone up from 10% to 100%, then charging an iPhone that was playing Pokemon GO. Size is perfect for a small pocket in my backpack or messenger bag, and can fit in my back pocket when necessary. It also feels very solid and well-built, unlike many charging bricks I've had.",0
5.0,,"April 7, 2018",Yes,"This product is so awesome that when I (or more likely my husband) misplaced it, I immediately ordered another one.",1
5.0,,"November 18, 2017",Yes,"This is AMAZING. I bought this for traveling to South America and with the new iOS update, my battery drains fast. I got about 5 charges out of this on an iPhone 6s. The battery pack is small enough to keep in your bag and charges very quickly.",0
1.0,,"September 4, 2018",Yes,I think i got a defective one because its been charging for 3 days and is still only on the first light (25%). I’ve switched out multiple chargers because I thought that would be the problem but nope it’s still mocking that blinking second light in my face. Im returning asap. Buy at your own risk.,0
5.0,,"January 29, 2019",Yes,Nothing much to say,1
5.0,,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"This is a great product and their customer service goes above and beyond to help with any issues that may arise. We purchased 3 of these devices for our kids, unfortunately one decided to no cooperate about a month or so after it was received. We notified Anker customer service and they replaced the defective PowerCore within a week. They really made sure we were happy with our purchase and yes, we would use them again and highly recommend them to our friends and family.",0
4.0,,"May 22, 2018",Yes,Takes to long to charge my phone and doesn't always work. Update...Anker contacted me directly to see what the issue was. After going through a couple of steps to make sure it was defective they replaced the charger with a new one. Very happy with customer service. So far the new charger is great.,0
5.0,,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"I don't know what took me so long to buy one of these.  I compact,  fits nicely in my purse.  It's charging ability is a 10 . Charges my phone very fast. The only thing us you my ave to buy an adapter for your USB connection to work but otherwise great for the price.",0
5.0,,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I spend a lot of time hunting or fishing and pack light.  Wanted a ""bump"" for my phone charge and this device is that and more.  Actually charges my phone quicker than a USB or wall charger.  I charged my I-phone 6 three times from &lt;30% and still had reserve.  A must have gadget if you are going to be remote and independent of external power supplies.",0
5.0,,"October 2, 2018",Yes,I had the smaller version of an anker portable charger but the charge didnt last much. This one completely blows it away. I can charge it once at night and I can spend the day without worrying about having to find an outlet and sitting next to it multiple times. I had my charger for about a year until it broke and Anker replaced it without a hassle. The purchase was well worth the price and beyond.,0
5.0,,"December 29, 2018",Yes,"Works perfectly! I wouldn’t change a thing, great price for the product, and so convenient if you’re going somewhere where you wouldn’t carry a bookbag, but would stuff this in your pocket instead.",0
5.0,,"May 28, 2017",Yes,I've tried a dozen power banks and they all disappointed until now. This one is slightly larger than wanted for my purse. But it charges several phones and an iPad and holds a charge for weeks.  I'm very pleased. Great for planes and travel.,0
4.0,,"July 9, 2018",Yes,Does what it's supposed to. I keep it in my car for emergencies and it the charge doesn't seem to deteriorate over time. The rapid charge feature works brilliantly. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a backup power brick for your phone.,0
5.0,,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"Takes FOREVER to charge, but that just means it is as advertised. I can charge my LG Stylo 2 off this pack from 20% to full almost three times off one charge.",0
4.0,,"March 19, 2018",Yes,Stopped working after two months but they sent me a new one which was great. I love this charger because it charges your phone quickly and has enough power to charge a second phone without dying.,0
5.0,,"July 10, 2018",Yes,"The Anker PowerCore 10000 I love it I can charge my iPhone and IPad. The charging time on the Anker last a long time .It is very powerful, you can weeks with out recharging it. Gave them to my children for a Christmas present and the love them also.",0
5.0,,"March 14, 2019",Yes,very well made i especially like the fact that i can check how much power it still has and its not super huge and cumbersome,0
5.0,,"January 23, 2019",Yes,"Have had two of these for awhile and they still work great. The first time I had one was a couple years ago, it didnt charge. Emailed anker and they shipped me a new one. Was so good that I bought a second as a back up. Super strong battery life, will charge your phone a couple times and then some.",0
5.0,,"August 2, 2018",Yes,Provides enough juice to charge my S5 almost 2 full times! And it charges it very fast. Great to have for power backup on long hikes and tours.,0
5.0,,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"Holds enough power for about 5 recharges, a bit heavy though. One thing I don't like is that the power cord is not integrated into the unit, so now I have to keep track of it for recharging.",0
5.0,,"October 18, 2017",Yes,"Owned this for about a month. It's small, it's light, it's super convenient.  One of these things is lifesaver when you are on vacation and need to charge on the go. I highly recommend this item.",0
5.0,,"March 16, 2018",Yes,I like that it charges my iPhone 6 at least 3 times and it seems to charge my phone much faster than when plugged in wall socket.  it is not too big for the punch it delivers.  I will buy Anker products again:) reasonably priced too,0
5.0,,"September 18, 2017",Yes,Was good for 3 charges on my iphone 6s while on a trip to Europe. It was a lifesaver. Totally worth the money. I charge it up in my car and leave it there for extended trips away from home.,0
5.0,,"December 5, 2018",Yes,Love this battery.  This is my most used portable battery for charging my phone because it's a good portable size.,0
5.0,,"June 24, 2018",Yes,This little power bank it's a mini power horse has enough power to keep you going like on trips camping and everywhere you go don't leave home without it.,0
5.0,,"October 15, 2017",Yes,Works great. I've gotten one of these for a friend and they're still using it a year and a half later. It's surprisingly fast and doesn't fall apart as easily as most chargers I've had before.,0
5.0,,"December 14, 2018",Yes,It worked perfectly! Was a definite Godsend. I had enough charge to fill up my battery plus fellow travelers too.,0
5.0,,"August 24, 2017",Yes,"Does a great job.  Does NOT have Qualcomm QuickCharge, but it actually charges my Samsung Galaxy S6 quickly despite being without it!  Charges for ~4-6 hours (may make your charger feel quite warm!).  I've owned this for a couple months now, and I need three hands to count how many times this has saved the day on a dying phone not just for myself, but for my friends!",0
5.0,,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"Even though the amount power this has isn't as much as some, this portable charger has came in clutch plenty of times. This smaller size is perfect to fit into my pockets - and can easily fully charge my phone multiple times if i am in need of it. This is a great purchase for the price and I can always rely on Anker to provide great products.",0
5.0,,"August 23, 2018",Yes,I love this! I commute to work by train and sometimes my phone dies and I use this on the go. It charges my phone so fast and is compact and easy to use. I would definitely recommend for commuters or even if you are traveling on vacation or on the go and need to charge your phone.,0
5.0,,"November 23, 2016",Yes,"Takes forever to charge but it will charge my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge at least 2.5 or 3 times with one charge. Definitely a lifesaver and good for the price. As someone who gets lost in big cities and public transit, I always need to have my phone GPS on and charged. This portable charger is small and powerful, I carry it in my purse/backpack all the time and it holds charge until you use it.",0
5.0,,"July 31, 2017",Yes,"Fantastic  charger! Bought it for my Samsung galaxy s6, charged it at 20% till 90%  twice  and had some juice left over. Really quick charge.",1
5.0,,"November 2, 2017",Yes,I have used this battery a few times and never had a problem. I had the smaller Anker battery and gave it to my wife so I can get this one. I've charged this battery and it will barely discharge unless you use it of course. Definitely worth the money!,0
5.0,,"October 8, 2018",Yes,I love the lights on the side that tell me how many charges i have left. It charges my iPhone X about 3 times before I have to charge it up again. Small enough to travel with which is what I bought it for.,0
5.0,,"January 5, 2017",Yes,"Love this product along with the other anker products I have bought.  Only thing I can really suggest is say how many charges it holds for a cell phone or tablet in the details section.  Most of your other product do say so,but I had trouble finding it for this one..",0
5.0,,"January 8, 2018",Yes,"Had a little problem with my first battery, but Anker contacted me, and had replaced it free of charge.  I’m really hoping this one is as sturdy as the first one I bought.",0
5.0,,"June 24, 2017",Yes,"Effective, straigh to the point charger. No lanterns or psychedelic lights that blink while it charges. It's small and charges VERY fast, and though some people find it a bit too heavy to comfortably carry in a purse, it surely is the lightest 10k mA charger I've seen.",0
4.0,,"December 20, 2018",Yes,It does not last as long on idle as would like.  But size is nice  This is my third anker,0
5.0,,"October 8, 2018",Yes,"This thing really comes in handy.  If you’ve never owned an external battery you’ll be pleased by this one.  FYI: My iPad charger charges it back up just fine, no issues whatsoever.",0
5.0,,"December 28, 2017",Yes,"I'm able to charge my iPhone 3-4 times with this charger. I bring it while backpacking. It's sleek and I keep the cord and the charger together in the little sleeve that's given. Charging it does take a while, but the little blue dots on the side give you an idea of how full it is. Great product",0
5.0,,"April 29, 2017",Yes,"I bought two of this charger, one for each of my two teenagers.  They have been using the charger since August 2016 and the charge has been holding up.  They are able to charge their iPhone 6 and 6s four times before the charger needs another full charge.  It is compact, easy to carry in their pocket or purses. The charger comes with a nice pouch that could keep both the charger and the cable in one place.  We are very happy with the purchase.",0
5.0,,"September 30, 2018",Yes,"Updated review..Was contacted by Akjer and after answering some questions about what happened they sent a replacement right away. I have other units that didn't have any problems, so seems to be limited to one unit...Used twice and now won't recharge. Of course now that it's one day after the 30 day return window.",0
5.0,,"February 15, 2017",Yes,"I love this model, and bought several so we would always have one charged, and a few for gifts.  Very happy with the battery life and charging speed.  Now if I can just get my wife to charge the second one instead of sitting on the nightstand next to the charger but unplugged...",0
1.0,,"January 31, 2019",Yes,"I have had this power bank for less than a year and it suddenly stopped charging. It worked great for some time, but I'm giving one star because it stopped working suddenly.",1
2.0,,"November 28, 2018",Yes,If I had it to do over I’d put a little bit more money towards a charger with the ability to plug in. Not good.,0
5.0,,"September 22, 2018",Yes,I bought this for my spouse for a trip and he loved it. He said it was very durable and he could recharge his phone multiple times. We highly recommend it.,0
4.0,,"April 4, 2018",Yes,After one month this device started draining the battery on my phone rather than recharging it but the seller contacted me and offered to replace it.,0
5.0,,"July 24, 2017",Yes,What an awesome product. Bought it 3 months ago and have used it multiple times. Took it to Disneyland and it fit in my cargo shorts with the phone plugged in and was fantastic. Used it for my phone and my sister's phone that day. Charges my iphone 6 faster than the wall charge it came with and it holds a ton of energy for charging.,0
5.0,,"April 7, 2019",Yes,We purchased this for a road trip as my husband's cigarette lighter port doesn't work. This worked great and had enough juice to fully charge two phones and had a little more juice before needing to be recharged!,1
3.0,,"February 12, 2019",Yes,"I want to love this charger, but when I have my iPhone plugged in, it will randomly stop charging because the Anker turned off. It does this even with a full charge. If there is a way to fix this I'd love to know!",1
5.0,,"December 13, 2018",Yes,"I am satisfied with this battery pack, it charges overnight and will allow my iphone X to charge about 3x to 4x under an hour. Do recommend.",0
5.0,,"December 4, 2017",Yes,"Best portable charger ever, It charges your phone real quick. And it lasts 2 1/2 charges for an Iphone 6, aboyt 1 1/2 for a samsung 8. It is small and portable with an excellent charge capacity.",0
5.0,,"October 20, 2018",Yes,The primary reason I’m writing this review is to provide a response to some of the negative reviews regarding product quality. I couldn’t be happier with the charger. We have used it routinely on a daily for months with absolutely no issues. I just ordered a second one so I can have one continually being charged. If there have been QC issues with this product it’s something I surely haven’t experienced.,0
5.0,,"April 7, 2019",Yes,Powerful lightweight power bank..I can get a solid 4 charges out if it before it discharges..It's also easy to carry around in my hand bag. I really like it.,1
5.0,,"February 13, 2018",Yes,"Bought this ages ago and it's still going strong. Excellent little power brick to take out of town for a weekend, or whenever you need power on the go for your mobile devices. Absolutely a recommended product.",0
5.0,,"June 10, 2018",Yes,Kept me going on my long trip. Compact and light. Love it.,1
5.0,,"January 2, 2017",Yes,"Best purchase I've made in a while. I use it hunting...when I'm out walking D.C. with my kids, and for many other occasions. Small enough that it isn't a pain to carry in a bag and small enough that it can fit in a coat pocket while it is charging your phone.",0
5.0,,"January 5, 2018",Yes,Just what I needed. Have charged phone fully twice and have not recharged yet,1
5.0,,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"I got one of these summer 2016 and within 6 months it stopped charging fully. I neglected to do anything about it until this past late summer and to my delight the 18 month warranty still held. Anker support had me try another cable to charge it but that didn't help. They cheerfully sent me another one promptly and I am most grateful. Meanwhile I ordered a bigger one of these to have one in my office as well as one at home, thank you Anker! Laurie",0
5.0,,"October 23, 2017",Yes,These are the best power pacs!! This is the second one I've ordered there so great. I can charge my tablet several times before the power pac needs to be charged itself.  I highly recommend them.,0
5.0,,"September 11, 2018",Yes,"My original order had some issues, contacted anker and they quickly sent a replacement. This product is a must buy great battery life and quick charging. What more can you ask for? Also very durable.",0
5.0,,"July 19, 2018",Yes,I bought this for a 3 day camping trip. The battery/charger works great. I charged my iphone 6 three times with it and it still had plenty of juice.,0
3.0,,"September 29, 2017",Yes,Product doesn't include a USB cord - you have to use your iPhone charger cord. Very inconvenient to be switching between the two...Update: bought product in June. It's been 6 months and the thing has died out. Absolute crap...Update #2: Contacted Anker reps and they were very helpful in getting me a refund.,1
5.0,,"December 15, 2016",Yes,"Anker products are great!! This is the 2nd external battery that I've purchased fromm them. Perfect size, yet still feels substantial. The charge on this one lasts forever &amp; charges my cell phone super quickly.  You can NEVER go wrong with any Anker product.  Great price as well!",0
5.0,,"April 30, 2017",Yes,"Fantastic.  I have had 2 full charges from this on my iPhone 6s (from 10% battery to full) and it has not even depleted the portable battery halfway.  Not only that, but it is small enough to fit in your pocket without noticing it is there, compare it to a wallet or even a small phone.  Perfect product, and I see myself ordering another on in the future if my current one ever bites the dust.",0
5.0,,"November 14, 2016",Yes,"Love it. Love it. Love it. It does its job exceptionally well and was perfect for my trip through Europe. Lightweight, sleek design, perfect. The charge held for SUCH a long time if it was not in use. When in use, it charged my iPhone very quickly and still had juice left for another few rounds. I could easily go all day without worrying about running out of power for any of my devices...Hands down, Anker has the best portable chargers. I will never use another. You will not regret this purchase.",0
5.0,,"August 25, 2017",Yes,"This power bank is unreal!  Charges faster than any other product I've owned, even charges faster than my wall charger.  Small enough to backpack with and has the right amount of juice to charge a Samsung Galaxy S7 at least once.",0
5.0,,"March 25, 2018",Yes,"Awesome. Holds a charge for a really long time; I probably get 4 full iPhone charges on a single one of these. Really compact and lightweight as well. I would recommend this, I have had no problems with it and will likely turn to Anker for more products in the future.",0
5.0,,"August 14, 2018",Yes,So Easy to use but is losing charge so bad......However to me surprise I received an email from Anker offering to ship me a replacement NO charge!  2 days later I received it and is working great!  Now that’s customer service!,0
5.0,,"February 21, 2018",Yes,"One of the best purchases for my international trip to Italy. Able to be out all day, but still charge my phone. Very important when you’re apt to get lost and need GPS.",0
5.0,,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"I love this product so much I bought it twice! It holds it's charge and can charge my Samsung S7 almost 3.5 times before I have to recharge it. Love it for travel, concerts, and everyday life!!..BUY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT",1
5.0,,"July 13, 2018",Yes,I am a teacher and use this to save files so I can work portably from my school computer to my home one and it works like a dream.,0
5.0,,"March 12, 2018",Yes,I heard from myfriends the brand ANKER ，he said it was best brand of power bank ! Now i order it ！it have really high quality material！ really heavy than other brand !,0
5.0,,"March 20, 2017",Yes,Charges phone super quickly!  It seems to charge my phone faster than a direct wall outlet charge (if that's possible).  It also charges my phone multiple times on a single charge of the Anker PowerCore 10000.  It's not super heavy so I don't mind carrying it in my purse all the time.,0
5.0,,"April 8, 2019",Yes,Incredible battery pack. Charges my phone up about 3 times before I have to recharge. Better than any other battery pack I’ve bought,0
5.0,,"October 31, 2016",Yes,"This has given me a LOT more free time away from the wall/car charger, especially as I'm out hiking/cycling, etc.  I saw it being used buy people doing week-long hikes and they reported that it worked well and was very reliable.  The price was fantastic and shipping was fast and on time.",0
5.0,,"March 24, 2018",Yes,"Anker makes great stuff and this has a great battery life for sure.  If you have more than one device than you need to buy the one with multiple USB's, I have one of those too!",0
5.0,,"February 17, 2018",Yes,"So far so good. Battery lasts several full iPhone 5s charges. It's small and packable as advertised, which was important to me. I use it when I travel and have to use my phone for navigation in the new city, while exploring on foot or a bike. I hope it'll work for few years.",0
5.0,,"March 10, 2018",Yes,Update 3/20/18:.Anker customer service reached out to me and sent me a new unit after leaving my review. The new battery arrived in a few days and works great. Truly impressive customer service.  I am adjusting my review to reflect this...Stopped taking a charge in less than a year's time. Only used/charged up three times until it failed. Blinks one blue light indicator indefinitely never actually taking a charge.,0
4.0,,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"Giving this four star's only because I wished it charged my device faster. Other then that, awesome product! Charges devices many times before needed to be charged itself",0
5.0,,"October 19, 2018",Yes,This comes in handy when you’re traveling and like taking pictures. I took this with me on a recent trip and it was a lifesaver! It’s small and compact and fits in my purse. I was able to get at least 6 charges on my iPhone before I had to recharge the battery back. I highly recommend this to every person who is always on the go on their phone! Great purchase!,0
5.0,,"July 26, 2018",Yes,This thing is a powerful battery and has a light to indicate the charge level. It is heavier than a really cheap external charger but that may only be a downside if you are backpacking or something.,0
5.0,,"September 6, 2017",Yes,So far so good.  Has a fast charge and is very compact.  Very pleased with it.  I ordered another for my wife.,1
5.0,,"August 24, 2016",Yes,"So far so good, it is charging my iPhone 5-6 times completely which is all I could ask for. Just spent 5 days in the woods and it was used to charge several phones multiple times while we were out there. It is also very compact and relatively light so it easily fits in pockets which is nice for being on the go. I would definitely recommend it. Also perfect for long pokemon hunting sessions.",0
5.0,,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"Highly recommend. Love the product and the service is great. Something went wrong with the unit I got, it was replaced without a question within days of me writing to the customer service. A great gizmo to have when you leave the house for the whole day. Let's face it - with the way phones are used these days, they rarely last the whole day.",0
5.0,,"June 20, 2017",Yes,"Love love love!  My phone is getting old, only stores enough battery for about 4 hours.  This saved me on travels through airports and across the country.  It recharges quickly, and recharges my phone quickly.",0
5.0,,"May 21, 2018",Yes,Everyone needs this!  I wish I had gotten one a long time ago.  Charges fast and it is like having an extra battery at all times.,0
1.0,,"August 3, 2018",Yes,If you have a samsung device that needs quick charge DO NOT get this charger. saw videos of people charging their devices in reviews and getting mA and I was no joke getting 90-100mA. left it charging my S8 for 45 min and it charged it 4 percent. all in all this product does not support quick charge and it also take 12 hours to fully charge the thing. Very disappointed in the product as well as Amazon recommending it.,0
5.0,,"November 7, 2017",Yes,"Works as advertised and the price was right.  Bought when hurricane was headed my way, thankfully did not need it for that.  Charged it and forgot about it.  After a month or so was headed out for a meeting and phone power was low.  Dug the PowerCore out of the drawer and plugged the phone in. No problems, Charged up the phone to 60% in the hour it took to get to the meeting.",0
4.0,,"May 17, 2018",Yes,I bought this for my sons trip and decided to test it. I charged the Anker 100% and it took 40 minutes to charge my phone 6 at 50%. I guess it was a reasonable time and the Anker still had power to charge.,0
5.0,,"March 6, 2016",Yes,This charger is compact and works well. It is a little heavy but is easy to hold in my hand due to its small size. It charges my phone quickly. So far it doesn't seem to get hot while charging it or my phone like some other chargers. I would recommend it.,1
4.0,,"July 8, 2018",Yes,This was a great portable charger while it worked. I didn't have to charge it frequently. I ordered it in February and now in July it doesn't charge my phone but when plugged into the wall it shows it is completely charged.,1
5.0,,"January 13, 2018",Yes,Man do I like this charger. I get 4 charges with it with still power left in the unit. It seems to charge my iphone quicker than when it;s plugged into the wall USB.,0
5.0,,"January 2, 2019",Yes,"Durable, easy to use, compact, great for daily or emergency use, 100% of a great product",0
5.0,,"December 14, 2018",Yes,"For 10000 mAh, this is smaller than I expected..ANKER even includes a carrying-case.",0
5.0,,"March 12, 2018",Yes,Saved my ass on a very cold night on Standing Indian mountain NC. all we could do was huddle in our tent in a freezing and windy night but we had internet! Seems so hold charge shorter time each charge but I like it.,0
5.0,,"September 27, 2016",Yes,"Great, compact charger that charges fast and provides multiple charges for my phone. I'm a frequent traveler and find I'm without power often, so having this in my briefcase is a huge benefit. It has plenty of power, and aside from being a bit heavy to accommodate it, has been a perfect purchase.",0
5.0,,"October 29, 2017",Yes,"Very great charger for keeping 2 phones charged up a couple times. More than enough storage to keep up with devices being away from a wall charger for the entire day. And on a plus note, is VERY water resistant, as this took a plunge into a toilet and retained its charge. I did let it sit overnight before topping it off again but it works perfectly fine after total submersion.",0
5.0,,"December 14, 2017",Yes,"This is the battery pack I would recommend to anyone that needs one. Anker has never disappointed me in the past and that is why I continue to buy their products. Very small and compact, throw it into a purse or backpack. Charges quickly as well. A+",0
5.0,,"January 8, 2018",Yes,"charges my samsung s5 at least 2.5 times on a single charge - maybe more but don't know because i haven't run it completely out..like the smaller size because it fits in my hand and bag more easily that the previous anker powercore charger i had - it was the size of a brick..very, very highly recommended.",0
5.0,,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"A lifesaver! Great for travel! After a full charge, it holds that charge for days before even using it.",0
5.0,,"September 26, 2017",Yes,"Best device I've ever purchased! Works like a champ! Charges my iphone in about 30 minutes.  I keep in my purse and can recharge on my usb port in my car. Seriously, one of the best products I've ever purchased!",0
5.0,,"August 3, 2018",Yes,"We used this product on a vacation, using GPS on our phones regularly.  This charger kept our phones charged easily and quickly.",0
5.0,,"September 2, 2018",Yes,"The best charger I've had so far! PokemoGo worthy! We shared this charger all day on vacation and it was only 50% down by the end of the night. It doesn't recharge rapidly, but your phone will last all day!",0
4.0,,"September 2, 2018",Yes,Good cell phone power. But heavier than others I've recently seen.,1
5.0,,"October 2, 2017",Yes,"Love this thing. Anker's portable power supplies are fantastic. I originally bought one to use when playing Pokemon Go, but ended up buying a second so I can rotate one out while the other charges.",0
5.0,,"July 7, 2017",Yes,Fantastic!  Used it daily on a recent trip to Europe.  Powerful yet compact enough to still fit in my mid-size purse.  Would recommend to anyone with mobile equipment whose battery tends to fade during heavy daily use.,0
3.0,,"August 23, 2016",Yes,I've read some pretty fantastic reviews about these anker powercore 10000s. So I ordered two of them. First let me say the size of these things is fantastic. Very easy to throw in your pocket and take with you anywhere. Unfortunately 1 of the units never fully charged when plugged into the wall. The forth indicator light just keeps flashing so I never know when it's done charging. The other unit seems to work just fine for now. I've charged it and then used it to charge up a few other things like my IPhone 6 and IPad. Worked great and still had 75% power left. Hopefully they have some good customer service and I can have the second powercore replaced. I'll update the review when and if the problem is solved.,7
5.0,,"August 22, 2018",Yes,"I have a pretty old (when did a 3 year old phone become ""pretty old""??) iPhone and it doesn't hold it's charge very well. This battery will charge my phone about 2.5 times and it charges relatively quickly! It's pretty small (although thicker than my phone), so I don't have any trouble putting it in a purse or a backpack.",0
5.0,,"November 4, 2017",Yes,I really love this charger!  It charges my iPhone and iPad very quickly.  It is nice and convienent to have on a road trip or a visit home.  No more anxiety about a dead cell phone.,0
5.0,,"December 10, 2017",Yes,perfect!  best quality of all the battery banks I ever had,1
5.0,,"June 18, 2018",Yes,"Takes a bit to fully charge the battery but once it is, it lasts about three charges! Not to mention, it charges pretty fast! Super satisfied with the purchase.",1
5.0,,"November 27, 2017",Yes,Compact and lightweight enough to carry in my bag every day; saves me when my iPhone loses power and I'm only mid-way through my day of meetings outside of the office.,0
5.0,,"June 23, 2017",Yes,Fits in my jeans pocket. Great for walking around and charging my phone. My co-workers always want to borrow this.,1
5.0,,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"I use this way more than I thought I would. It will charge my 7 plus twice from less than 15%, and still have power left. I use it to charge all sorts of usb devices with it perfectly.",0
5.0,,"December 16, 2018",Yes,Recharges an Iphone 6 fully within about 2 hours; used over 12 x past month.,0
5.0,,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Charges my phone 4 times. Not too heavy and works well so far. (Have had it for a few months now),0
2.0,,"April 9, 2019",Yes,"The charger was great for the first couple of weeks. I could fully charge my phone at least 5 times before it died. After my first couple of weeks with it I noticed that it was taking longer to charge. It took 3 full days for it to charge and it started to die quickly. This is a great temporary product because it’s not long lasting, or at least it wasn’t for me.",0
5.0,,"September 6, 2018",Yes,It's a little pricy but it gets the job done. The small size allows for easy access and it can be carried to just about anywhere.,0
5.0,,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"I love anker. They have great quality items. It is small, and charges my phone fast. The wire it comes with is okay, so I use a different one that I also bought from Anker. Best deal!",0
5.0,,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"It’s compact, durable, lightweight,  attractive design, and very affordable.  What is not to like about this charger. I have been using a square battery brick which is very functional but bulky and heavy. I was pleasantly surprised by how quick the Anker Power Core charged my phone and IPad. I recommended this product to the rest of my family. Thank you",0
5.0,,"March 19, 2016",Yes,This works great. I was able to charge my phone twice and my tablet once. This will be perfect for camping and an..This works great. I was able to charge my phone twice and my tablet once. This will be great for camping or a power outage.,1
2.0,,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"It was showing two dots out of 4, but provided no power to the iphone.  Sheeesh!..It has been on two dots forever.  I will attempt to recharge it.",0
5.0,,"October 15, 2018",Yes,I've used a couple of Anker products before and always found them delightful. I decided to splurge and buy this bigger powerbank and so far it's been amazing. It's the perfect size and the perfect amount of battery life for a great price.,0
5.0,,"December 18, 2016",Yes,"Perfect size for stuffing in your pocket and going on the move while charging!  This battery is light, portable and kept my cell phone and wifi hotspot going all day while I was on vacation.  Couldn't ask for more in a smaller package.  Very pleased and highly recommend this item.",0
5.0,,"May 28, 2017",Yes,"The best battery pack. Only recharge it 1 maybe 2 times a week, and it tops my phone off super fast. Not too big either, fits fine in my pants or suit jacket. Doesnt get too warm when charging. Just a really useful product. Carry it with me wherever I go.",0
1.0,,"November 2, 2017",Yes,"Does not come with USB charging cable for iPhone, brings other cable &amp; no clue for what! A little on the heavy side. Not thrilled...went on the reviews and hope it’s worth keeping.",0
5.0,,"June 26, 2018",Yes,"Well made. Charging very fast with correct cables. I expected a lighter weight, however, may be asking for too much.",0
5.0,,"June 12, 2017",Yes,This thing is awesome.  I use it all day to top off my phone.  My LG G4 is such a battery hog but this charger keeps me going all day long.  It is great if you have an outside job and can access a/c power.,0
3.0,,"December 9, 2018",Yes,It's not a terrible power bank for the price. The one I recieved worked fine for a few weeks but now it doesn't seem to charge up to the max level. No matter how long I have it charging up the battery indicator will never reach max.,0
5.0,,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this because I was traveling for a couple of weeks, it did meet all my expectations, and would purchased again",0
5.0,,"November 10, 2017",Yes,Excellent quality and charge!.We bought for our Disney trip to be able to use their apps on our phones and this was a game changer. Kept us using photopasses and MaxPasses all day long from rope drop to fireworks. Highly recommend,0
5.0,,"December 4, 2018",Yes,This product charged my phone is like 10 mins. From 2% to 95% not even kidding. A must have for traveling!,0
5.0,,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"Best compact external battery! I travel with it constantly and charges my phone fast! It does take some time to charge it from the wall source, but it's worth it! I get about 4 charges from this battery for my phone/tablet. Does get a bit warm to touch while charging, but not that bad. Overall, it's definitely worth it!",0
5.0,,"June 26, 2018",Yes,"Charges my phone 2.5 times on a single charge. Faster than a slow charger, but not as fast as my Samsung fast wall charger",0
5.0,,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"Great little battery. Keeps a charge for weeks. I consider myself a light user (charging one device from 10% to 100% a couple times a week, occasionally multiple devices in a day), so you may need to recharge it more regularly than I do, but I've had no issues myself. Charges reasonably fast. Battery is about the size and thickness of a standard deck of cards, so it is very portable.",0
5.0,,"January 26, 2019",Yes,"Bought this for my trip to Japan and it was more than enough to keep my phone charged all day! Pretty quick charging too. It's a bit heavier than any other portable chargers I've had, but it's compact enough for easy-carry; it fit well in my small purse and even in my back pocket (women's jeans = small pockets) when needed!",0
5.0,,"June 24, 2018",Yes,"Anker makes great batteries. I never have trouble with them in any condition in Maryland (we get hot, cold and wet)",0
4.0,,"January 15, 2019",Yes,"I expected to get more charges out of it...I have an iPhone XS Max. So maybe that’s why I only get a little more than 1 and a half phone charges on it. Since it advertises for 10s...I will say, though, it charges my phone extremely fast, which is why I still use it often!",0
5.0,,"April 5, 2017",Yes,Originally got an item but had an issue. Receieved an email from the company immediately to resolve it. Item works great! I highly recommend!,1
5.0,,"April 2, 2018",Yes,will charge my phone at least 4 times before it needs to be recharged. Kinda big and heavy but that's cause it charges phone 4 times.,0
5.0,,"October 27, 2017",Yes,I never leave home without it! I am a merchandising vendor so I am always moving around and I don't always have a place to put my phone down. I can keep my phone in my purse and charge it care free.,0
4.0,,"February 22, 2018",Yes,I really liked it until it died today.  I’ve had five months...It was the cord that came with it.  I’ve changed the rating to 4 star. I had to  get a new cord  from Anker.  The cord was $9.99.,0
5.0,,"February 23, 2017",Yes,"I've only used the PowerCore once so far, but it far exceeded my expectations.  I used it for a day snowboarding, which usually drains my phone battery consistently when using the skitracks app.  The PowerCore kept my phone fully charged, and when I was done riding for the day two friends were able to charge their phones (iPhone 6s) at the mountain bar.  After all that, the PowerCore showed 3/4 charge remaining.  My only grip was that it took longer than expected to fully charge the PowerCore, but that did not prove to be an issue as I charged it the night before.",0
5.0,,"January 18, 2019",Yes,"It's pretty small, and can charge my phone a couple of times before it's drained.",0
5.0,,"November 13, 2018",Yes,My boyfriends phone is always dying or dead and it drove me crazy so I bought this for him. It works great and he loves it,0
5.0,,"October 9, 2018",Yes,We use this to keep our older iphone's charged throughout the day. So far works as listed.,0
5.0,,"September 26, 2018",Yes,Awesome little bank. I love the fact that you can put it anywhere because it’s small.,0
4.0,,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"Overall power is Grade A, it's compact enough to fit in my pocket and it's very sturdy. However, my only issue so far is that it shuts off for some reason with some devices. I have checked other portable charging units and so far it is only this one I have the issue with and the only reason why I'm giving a 4 star rating. It's not a dealbreaker at all for me personally, and I hope it isn't for whoever is reading this. I recommend this product 100%.",0
5.0,,"March 23, 2019",Yes,Birthday gift to my husband. He absolutely loved it. It’s heavy. It comes so handy for him.,0
5.0,,"July 25, 2016",Yes,"great size, high current charging, high quality feel. Excellent for road trips / vacation. Since my purchase I've used it almost exclusively to charge my phone. Something about being able to charge while not being tethered to the wall is a lot more enjoyable than I thought it could be.",0
5.0,,"October 9, 2017",Yes,I bought this charger for my grandfather when hurricane Irma hit Florida. I shipped it to him and it was really easy for him to use when his power went out and he couldn't charge his cell phone. So glad I bought it!,0
5.0,,"November 4, 2017",Yes,"The powerbank was so small, that when I received it from the mail, I thought I ordered the wrong item. The box that it was enclosed in was the size of a battery for Sony camcorder! I was amazed how fast it charged my iPhone from less than 15% to 85% in no time! It also came with a netted bag &amp; a USB charger to charge the battery. It's a great product! I would definitely recommend this product to my friends &amp; family!",0
5.0,,"January 10, 2019",Yes,It holds a huge charge and is tiny. What more would anyone want?,0
4.0,,"September 6, 2017",Yes,"makes a great gift for business colleagues or busy professionals - i have ordered two of these for two different people and have gotten good feed back, but i have not used one myself",0
5.0,,"November 11, 2017",Yes,"I know it's just a battery but I'm in love. Incredible charging power, long battery life and sturdy product. Went on a 6month holiday and took this everywhere. Even got two sizes. Use in every day life now. A must for people with gadgets",0
5.0,,"October 22, 2018",Yes,I originally bought this to charge my phone at a convention where I knew outlets would be war zones. It was perfect!,0
5.0,,"June 23, 2017",Yes,"Outstanding product! Got it half charged - two out of four blue lights when turned on. Charge to full took about 4 hours with a 2A charger. Then it took merely 2 hours to charge a Samsung Galaxy S5 from 5% to 100%, and it only went down to three blue lights. Small size is a huge plus when going hiking, bicycling or camping. Highly recommended!",1
5.0,,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"This saved my life a couple times on my road trip around America. When I went hiking, and times where I had no charge outlets this became my life saver. It charges up VERY fast too, though that could because I charged it with my fast charger...i'm not sure if that has any effect on it..but all in all its pretty great!",0
5.0,,"August 1, 2018",Yes,"Works good &amp; fast... not always a good thing, right? Well this time it is! Charges within 2 shakes of a lamb’s tail!",0
5.0,,"May 3, 2017",Yes,"For any product that Anker produces, I don't hesitate: I only buy Anker products. I give them to people I love when I find they don't have a battery backup, then buy myself another. It gives me peace of mind.",0
3.0,,"April 3, 2019",Yes,"I made the mistake of not double checking the model of I-Phone this charger was for.  I saw the headline ""I-Phone"" and just assumed it fit my I-Phone X.  The cord that came with it is for an I-Phone 8.  The charger itself is great.....I will just have to get the proper cable for my phone.",0
4.0,,"July 10, 2018",Yes,so far it lets me get a full charge about 4 times from below 10% battery life. it’s good for it’s size. only down side is the material is easily can be scratch and show scratches but i guess it’s durable from drops and impacts.,1
2.0,,"September 4, 2017",Yes,This never ever charges will have it plugged in all day and will come home to seeing it still at 1 light will plug it back in a few times and wait an hour until it finally actually starts charging.,0
5.0,,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"Nice little power supply!  Works as expected, is small, and seems to be well built.",0
5.0,,"April 27, 2017",Yes,Can't complain. Compact and perfect for powering devices over and over again before having to be revitalized. Well worth the price paid. And it even comes with it's own bag to carry the USB plug and cable. I also like that the same cord can then be used to power other devices.,0
5.0,,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"Performs as expected, charged / discharged many times without issue.  It has all the expected safety testing marks and a handy bag to keep battery and cable together.  I use it with readers and an iPhone.",0
5.0,,"August 2, 2018",Yes,Easy to recharge and use. Comes in a nice carrying pouch. Works with usb-c devices but does not come with a usb-c cord,0
3.0,,"August 20, 2018",Yes,I’ve used it about 30 times now from full charge to empty and each time the battery lasts shorter and shorter.. I have used it on my iPhone 8 and that’s all.. I’m not powering an iPad or anything similar.. so I probably might not have the proper expectation? But this is 2018 so......,0
5.0,,"June 13, 2017",Yes,Took this gem on my trip to Scandinavia its small enough to take around and recharged my iPad and phone 4x glad I got it..,1
5.0,,"October 4, 2016",Yes,"Small and lightweight yet powerful enough to charge my Galaxy S5 three times. The size allows you to fit it in your pocket while charging your phone. After using for a number of days in Florida heat, the battery pack did not get hot even when in my pocket. Charging of my S5 took about 1 to 1.5 hours to get to 100% charge while not in use from 15% battery.",0
5.0,,"August 30, 2016",Yes,"My wife and I each bought one of these as a battery backup - and we are not disappointed.  Small enough to travel with you easily, this recharges my phone multiple times on a single charge - great for camping, or for extended use like watching videos.  Also an excellent solution for all the Pokemon Go players out there.",0
5.0,,"July 26, 2017",Yes,Great buy...give plenty of time to fully charge and it will recharge your phone several times.  You can also use it to power a device that is normally powered by a USB to AC power adapter.,0
5.0,,"December 25, 2017",Yes,Excellent product!! It has been a lifesaver multiples times.  Just charge it up and leave it in your car grab it for a long trip and you're set.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,0
5.0,,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"This thing is awesome. I went on vacation and did not change it for a about 3 days and it fully charged my phone from less than 20% about 5 times and it still had two ""dots"" of charge.",0
4.0,,"February 21, 2017",Yes,"I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't really used it much in the short time I've had it. But so far it seems well built, is easy to use, and looks nice. Its a charger I wouldn't mind plugging into my phone and it sitting on a table in front of me while I'm out somewhere.",0
5.0,,"June 30, 2017",Yes,I handed these little gems out for Christmas and everyone loves them.  Why wouldnt you want a portable phone charger for when your out and about and the phone is low?  Get one you will love it.,0
5.0,,"October 6, 2016",Yes,"Charges my Nexus 5X fast (even though it has to be converted to USB-C first). There's a ton of power in this pack! The specs say around 3.5 charges, but it's more like 2-2.5 for me. The size is great. It'll fit in your back pocket while you walk around a city.",0
4.0,,"October 14, 2018",Yes,Takes forever to charge. But it fills up my phone about 2x or once for my iPad. Really only use it as a last resort so I guess I can’t complain too much.,0
5.0,,"January 28, 2019",Yes,Have only had it a couple weeks. And as of yet haven't needed to recharge it..Works great.,0
5.0,,"April 3, 2018",Yes,It worked great for 14 months until it stopped working. Lights come on but it won't charge any devices. Slow charging the pack but it could charge my phone several times before needing to plug it in again..Upgraded to 5 stars for the hassle free replacement and awesome customer service.,0
4.0,,"February 2, 2019",Yes,"It’s just like any other Anker, but my only problem is it dies fast (not like my others) and it makes my Charging cable EXTREMELY hot.",0
1.0,,"February 10, 2019",Yes,For the last 4-6 months it will not charge. I’ve had it for over a year with NO PROBLEMS...then all of a sudden it doesn’t want to do anything. Very disappointed.,1
5.0,,"March 11, 2018",Yes,Holds a lot of charge. I love this. Came in handy for a recent long-term power outage. Was able to recharge multiple times. Perfect!,0
5.0,,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"Bought the charger, used it and it worked great. Then it seemed that the charger had died - but it wasn't the charger, it was my cord. Charger still working great!",0
5.0,,"January 4, 2019",Yes,Great! Love how small/compact this is — fits perfectly into my purse and isn’t heavy! Quick to charge.,0
3.0,,"June 29, 2018",Yes,"It is great size, and for the first two weeks it was great but I work in sales and have an I pad it is plugged into daily and this last week it has started to die on me a lot faster then it has before. Still good for the price.",1
5.0,,"June 18, 2018",Yes,Perfect power bank to travel with- it's compact and light weight. Charges fast too. I would recommend.,0
5.0,,"June 25, 2018",Yes,I've used these chargers several times.  Takes quite awhile to fully charge but I'm able to fully charge my cell phone at least four times.  Fits nicely in my purse for use on the go.,0
5.0,,"March 21, 2019",Yes,Lots of juice.  Takes awhile to charge but small and reliable.,0
5.0,,"January 23, 2019",Yes,Still holding up strong after two years of owning this thing. Holds the charge. Not too heavy to carry around.,0

5.0,,"February 15, 2019",Yes,Took a little longer to charge than expected however the battery life is well worth it. Used for an extended weekend and still has juice to spare,1
5.0,,"March 13, 2019",Yes,"Love this product. The small size and portability combined with the capacity to store 4 charges means I never leave the house without it. This is seriously the most useful 30 bucks I’ve ever spent. I had an issue with mine and Anker was quick to make it right, sending me a timely replacement for free. Excellent customer service and product quality.",0
5.0,,"September 12, 2017",Yes,I actually bought it for my in laws and during hurricane Irma. They kept their phones charged for almost 2 days. Of course using them only for necessary communication. But still great battery.,0
5.0,,"June 27, 2017",Yes,"I have several of these.  In general they are great.  However my newest one purchased about six weeks go died.

5.0,,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"Very good battery pack, my phone is in the program to piss you off after 2 year stage and it charges at a decent rate not very fast but I was able to go from 18% to 70% and still watch videos in an hours worth of time. For the capacity it has the price is very good. It is like the deck of cards but slightly smaller cuz of the rounded edges.",0
5.0,,"January 11, 2019",Yes,Needed one for vacation and emergencies. This does the trick.,0
5.0,,"April 23, 2018",Yes,Bought the Anker Powercore 10000 back in December and it worked phenomenal. Took it on a trip internationally and it worked wonders all trip long. But much to my surprise it stopped being able to output power 3 months later. I contacted Anker support about my issue and they sent a new one! Will keep buying more products from them because all their products are top notch and there support is extremely helpful!,0
5.0,,"November 16, 2017",Yes,I used it while on a trip and it did what it is supposed to do. Easy to use but did have to order extra connection so I could use it for either my Apple or my Amazon Kindle.,0
5.0,,"July 3, 2017",Yes,"Anker is by far one of my favorite electronic brands. The PowerCore 10000 is small and powerful. I have been able to charge my Samsung Note 5 at least twice on a single charge which is a +,+,+ for me. I am thinking about buying one more for my spouse. As usual great quality provided by Anker.",0
5.0,,"November 4, 2018",Yes,I have to fly and walk job sites for my job. I bought this lil sucker to help my iPhone and iPad. Will fully charge both and still have some power.

5.0,,"August 25, 2016",Yes,Bought this to travel with and it is great. I can charge multipal devices multipal times without needing to recharge it. I also like that it doesnt get hot when being used.

I absolutely love the minimal, functional, compact design, it is perfect on the go (Pokemon hunting!). It charges my Nexus 6P (USB Type-C) and iPhone 7 with zero issues. If you want a compact, lightweight 10000 mA battery pack, look no further!",0
5.0,,"June 29, 2017",Yes,This item is an excellent addition to my toolkit of power supplies. It came as promised around the date that I ordered it. I like the item and it does what it says it's going to do and the package was easy to,0

5.0,,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"Love it - I play Pokémon Go, which is a huge battery drain.  This battery can easily charge two IPhones and is easy to carry while I play.",0
3.0,,"November 19, 2017",Yes,I took this on a three week overseas trip so I could keep my phone and camera charged. It was able to give two phone charges and one phone charge before it had to recharged.,0
5.0,,"September 24, 2018",Yes,"This is the first portable charger I've owned and can't believe I hadn't gotten one before, it has good battery life and charges phones and headphones really fast. At this point, I'd go as far as say that I'd rather charge this portable charger and then charge my phone or anything else using it.",0
5.0,,"July 3, 2018",Yes,The charge lasts for what seems like forever. I'm sure it can charge my phone from 0 to 100 at least a few times on a full charge. The only thing that could be better is if it didn't take so long to charge itself. It's at least 4+ hours to get the powerbank up to full power.,0
2.0,,"March 21, 2019",Yes,The USB port was easily crushed inside and it can’t be used.,1
3.0,,"August 16, 2018",Yes,Not sure if i just had bad luck but it died after just 2 months of usage,2

1.0,,"January 17, 2019",Yes,Less than 3 months old and already garbage. Doesn’t hold a charge and after charging for hours and seeing 4 lights it immediately dies when I try to charge a phone.,1
5.0,,"April 9, 2018",Yes,I like the size of the charger and that it can charges my phone two times to 100% and the 3rd time it gives 30-50%. The only thing that's tough is how long it takes to charge before you can use it. Bit if you do the math it no longer then you charging your phone 3 times.,0
5.0,,"September 17, 2018",Yes,"I use this every day, it's saved me so much time and worry.  I've had it for over a year now, and I still get 3-4 charges from it with my S7.  Great product for the price--the small size is super convenient.",0
5.0,,"November 17, 2018",Yes,This product held a charge even after two weeks of not being used.,0
5.0,,"March 5, 2018",Yes,LOVE. Use it every. Single. Day. We take it with us everywhere. Wish I had a few more. Lasts about a day for us when we’re out. Use it for two phones and two iPads.,0
5.0,,"May 1, 2017",Yes,"I loved the first one so well that I bought a second one of these.  Charges fast and holds a lot of charging power.  The second one I bought did not charge.  I contacted the seller, exchanged it and the replacement works like the first one did.  Glad I got it.",0
2.0,,"April 16, 2019",Yes,"I loved this product at first, but after 4 months of occasional use it won’t hold a charge. Pretty disappointed.",1
5.0,,"February 14, 2018",Yes,I have an array of anker chargers - This one is the size of a credit card so it easily fits in my pocket for busier days that I use my phone for video recording events and consistent streaming.,0
5.0,,"December 18, 2016",Yes,"Purchased this as a gift to a friend. Anker did not let me down. The first thing that surprised us was how small it was. My friend uses a battery pack everyday since they are heavily use their phone and are usually unable to find an outlet. They use an iPhone 7 Plus. So far, they have been able to charge multiple times before depleting.",0
5.0,,"October 3, 2018",Yes,I’m very pleased with this. It has saved my life a million times. I never go anywhere without it.,0
1.0,,"January 31, 2019",Yes,"Received the product and it looked like great quality.  I charged it and the 5 lights indicated it was fully charged.  I plugged in my iPhone, it charged for about 2 minutes and stopped.  The 5 lights that were glowing now showed 1 and wouldn’t charge anything.  This is after completely charging overnight.  Not happy at all.",0
5.0,,"May 29, 2016",Yes,"Recharges my iPhone 4 times..UPDATE: After plugging the charger into your device, you MUST press the inconspicuous button on the side for the charger to start charging.  Charging will NOT automatically start by simply connecting the charger to a device.",1

5.0,,"September 26, 2017",Yes,"Since owning this, I have never been without a charge in my cell phone. It's compact size means you can plug it in and still keep it in your front, or jacket, pocket.",0
5.0,,"September 8, 2016",Yes,"Mother-in-laws Samsung Galaxy S4 is very picky about chargers and amperage. This one worked great for her, and it charges other devices fine as well.  The capacity is large given the size. Most 10000+ mAh packs are significantly bigger and heavier.",0
5.0,,"December 14, 2016",Yes,"Awesome size. Great power. Enough power for my needs! higlhy recommended...doesn't charge Macbook 12' , an new USB C macbook pros, but it does keep them in the same level os energy ( doesn t drain )",1
5.0,,"April 5, 2018",Yes,"This is very useful for on the go charges, but if you are in marching band and are in a cabin with no outlets, then buy a battery with more power storage. This is good for moderate uses and emergencies.",0
5.0,,"December 15, 2016",Yes,"This battery is great, i love the fact that it charges faster than a regular outlet charger and it canhold a few charges. Highly recommend it! Ive been buying products from angler and they never disappoint, so far very satisfied with all of anger products",0
5.0,,"September 17, 2018",Yes,This power bank is made very well and is high powered and fast! I needed to contact Anker’s customer service and they are at the top of their game!.I highly recommend this product!,0
5.0,,"August 4, 2017",Yes,I have a Samsung Note 4 and I get about 3 full charges out of this. Its small and portable. The cord could be heavier duty but it kept me playing games on my flight to Denver,0
5.0,,"December 26, 2016",Yes,I was looking for a small but powerful charger to fit in my purse.  My other charger is heavy and bulky.  This charger is small and lightweight but packs 10.000 mAh. It comes with cable and case and is the perfect size; maybe a little smaller than a cig pack.  Love it so far!,0
5.0,,"December 28, 2018",Yes,"If you have iphoneitis, you need this external battery.",0
5.0,,"April 5, 2018",Yes,This is the best invention made prior to charging. Makes life so much easier instead of finding a outlet all the time,0
5.0,,"October 3, 2017",Yes,"Kept my weak iPhone 6+ running thru Europe. It has lots of juice to bring the phone back up to full charge more than once. Takes some time to recharge, use a 2.4 amp charger.",0

5.0,,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"Multiple Charges, works as intended...Initially purchased for a trip to an Amusement Park where I would be using my phone heavily to take pics, video, track kids, and purchases...I was able to fully charge my phone twice and still had about 1/2 the power left on this battery pack.",0
5.0,,"June 2, 2017",Yes,"I didn't a lot of research before choosing which power bank to get, I went with this one cause it was cheaper and had great reviews. Well I totally agree with everything, I can charge it up full overnight and then it'll last for 3-4 days charging my phone up multiple times a day before it needs recharged. Its doing exactly what I bought it for and will be perfect for my vacation this week!!",0
5.0,,"May 17, 2017",Yes,"I have used this product for nearly a year. I love how light it is and the small form factor. I used this to charge my Motorola Moto G3 android smartphone. I have done some tests, and this product can charge 1% of my smartphone's battery in 1 and a half minutes.",0
5.0,,"January 3, 2019",Yes,Does what it's supposed to.  Nice and compact and charges quickly.,0
5.0,,"March 20, 2016",Yes,"Great Product, small, powerful and looks good. Easy to carry in a pocket, purse or brief case. You are never without a charge for your phone when you need it. If you have a cell phone you need this product.",1

5.0,,"September 10, 2016",Yes,"I have two of those...bought one and then the second subsequently, because it's a great product! I Have many uses for portable charger: phones, tablets, bt speakers and lipo batteries for a drone. The charging is faster then regular wall adapter gives. To recharge the bank itself I use my moto xp turbo charger, fast and safe. No overheating issues at all, this Anker 10000 is a keeper.",0
2.0,,"July 20, 2018",Yes,Garbage... bought 8 months ago and now it wont even charge my phone. Wont but another product from Anker.,2
5.0,,"May 26, 2018",Yes,"i take this everywhere with me, especially traveling. it’s small enough to fit in a purse or jacket pocket. charges your phone more than once. i’ve never used it for extended periods so i couldn’t tell you how many charges, but on a five day trip i never had to recharge the battery when using it for casual recharging during the day. worth the money to never have a dead phone!",0
4.0,,"July 3, 2017",Yes,"The first one I ordered only lasted 1 month, but the replacement the seller sent me works great. Charges my phone as fast as if it was plugged in. I get about 2 full recharges on my LG V20.",0

5.0,,"April 1, 2017",Yes,"Did a great job. Very compact and easy to use.  Several fewer arguments on a long car ride when the kids did not have to fight about ""who gets the charger"" when their power runs out (we had family time too).",0
5.0,,"April 4, 2019",Yes,"Charges my iPhone 6S about 3 and a half times. It’s very light and portable, fits perfectly in my pocket. Great for traveling. I’ve taken it on airplanes several times with no trouble. Works great for long flights or car trips where charging ports are not available. Keeps my phone charged all day long!",0
5.0,,"March 5, 2018",Yes,"I read the excellent reviews and was still skeptical.  After my fast charge had long stopped working, I found myself desperately trying to find a seat near an outlet several times a day while out and about.  I am so GRATEFUL for this amazing charger!!  It charges my phone soooo fast, and not once does it or my phone overheat as a result.  I only have to recharge it once every few days.  This thing is a must own!",0
4.0,,"February 3, 2019",Yes,"Updating my review since my specific piece was faulty. Al my friends have loved this for a reason. Also, Anker resolved the issue promptly when I reported it to them.",1
5.0,,"September 30, 2016",Yes,I got this for a 5 day trip I took that required a 6 hour road trip there and 6 hours back.. I had no idea I was stumbling across one of my greatest buys off amazon. I may have gotten it while on sale or a special price but I wouldn't mind paying $100 for this thing. Great great product,0
5.0,,"March 6, 2019",Yes,This battery pack works great and charges fast!,0
5.0,,"May 18, 2018",Yes,Had it for about 5 months. Gets used roughly every other day to recharge an iPhone 6s plus. Works great.,0

5.0,,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"This is hands down my favorite portable charger I have used to date. It does take a while to completely fuel the charger, but when its full, I can get almost 2 full charges with it. It also charges my iphone quickly, less than a minute for my phone to turn on after being completely drained. It is more pricey than the cheaper options, but you will not be disappointed.",0

5.0,,"December 31, 2018",Yes,Charges my iphone x I believe in 45 min full charge,0
5.0,,"August 16, 2018",Yes,Great product from Anker.  I bought it for my wife to use on her Samsung s7 edge.  She has had it for about 4 months now and it still charges well.  Very QUICK charge as advertised ..went from 2% charge to 60% in about 30 minutes.  Smaller than a cigarette pack but it is a bit hefty in weight. I would definitely recommend this item.,0
1.0,,"June 26, 2018",Yes,Aweful!! Had it fully charged &amp; lite the clip lights for 3 minutes then out!!  Another disaster at my Sisters Memorial.,0
5.0,,"June 29, 2018",Yes,Charges my (new) Samsung Galaxy S5 4 times off of a single charge of the device. Great for on the go and in the boonies. Charges the phone completely within a half hour. Easy to carry around charging in the pockets of cargo shorts or whatever.,0
5.0,,"February 17, 2017",Yes,This is good. Now that i'm not at a desk anymore i notice how quickly my phone battery runs out. I carry this with me and it seems to charge it quite a bit without needing a charge itself. Plus it slips in a pocket. It seems like a really reasonable 'in between' in terms of the more expensive ones and the really cheap ones that need recharging all the time.,0
5.0,,"January 19, 2019",Yes,Great product and that fantastic 18 month warranty!!!!!!!!!!,0
5.0,,"June 11, 2017",Yes,I purchased 5 anker batterys mostly because every time some ask me about it I give it to them to try saying it's the best on the market and I never get them back they all love it and have ordered more on their own . I HAVE personal try 20 different battery chargers . And found not one that compared to anker no matter the price,0
5.0,,"February 26, 2018",Yes,We love to play games on our phone.  When we run out of battery it's great to have this charger as a backup.  Also great for taking on trips when it may not be convenient to charge a phone.  Charging cord plugs into the computer to charge.,0
5.0,,"July 31, 2016",Yes,"This is the perfect charger if you're looking for something super powerful with a small form factor. With 10,000 mAh, this can charge my phone a few times. It also charges super quickly because of Anker's PowerIQ. I let someone borrow my charger, and they were shocked when they saw how quickly their phone battery went up. The price may seem a little steep, but I ended up paying less than $20 for this charger because Amazon has some amazing deals. Anker is a super trustworthy company. Their packaging is nice, and the portable charger came with a cable and a carrying bag. They've got a loyal customer now.",0
5.0,,"January 28, 2018",Yes,This was a gift for my daughter. She was using mine all the time so I bought her a red one..Just as good as my black one! And I know that mine is charged and ready when I need it,0

5.0,,"December 28, 2017",Yes,"This charger is awesome! It has saved my butt many times, when I needed to charge my phone. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and this charger is very handy, as I can charge my phone while I'm walking!",0

Customer service is a dying thing...I had a issue with the product and the Anker team was all over it...Highly recommend this product and company..Thank you Anker!!!!,0
4.0,,"April 23, 2018",Yes,"Compact and works. I own the Samsung Galaxy S9+ so it takes a little longer to fully charge. Otherwise, perfect for on the go.",0
5.0,,"May 20, 2017",Yes,This is old faithful for me. Its a good size battery pack its not too bulky it could fit just about anywhere. This is great especially on the go where its not too much of a hassle to carry around. I'd definitely recommend buying this little guy.,0
5.0,,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"The Anker PowerCore 10000 is a great product for charging your cellphone when you are not near an outlet or car...Recently, the little mesh case it comes in, needed to be replaced...I called customer service.  After a very nice conversation with Ashley, 2 days later, the case arrived at my home, for free...Very good all around!..Thanks Anker!",0
1.0,,"March 23, 2019",Yes,Stopped working after a couple of months..Be mindful of that return cut off date! - I missed it and realized there was a return by date after it stopped working.,0

4.0,,"February 14, 2019",Yes,"I have been using this product for almost a month and it has worked perfectly, Baker is a trusted brand in my eyes and this proves it.

I recently had a multiple day power outage and it keept my phone charged when I needed it most.",0
5.0,,"January 1, 2017",Yes,"I had a mophie for years but it went out on me.  I just didn't want to spend as much as before so I picked this one.  The charges last much longer than the mophie.  It is small enough to fit in my purse, love it!",0
5.0,,"October 2, 2018",Yes,I needed something powerful but not bulky so I could keep it in my purse. I also got the color red so my kids and hubby can't claim it as theirs!!,0
5.0,,"June 3, 2018",Yes,"Charges fairly quick, compact, med. weight, and I have charged my phone 4 times before recharging the Anker.",0
4.0,,"May 3, 2017",Yes,"I started with Anker when I got a hand-me-down S3 that needed a battery. So I got an ANKER extended battery case, which ended up lasting quite a lot longer than the standard Samsung battery. So I returned for an external battery back-up, now that my batteries have lasted a few years and are nearing their end life-cycles. This battery back-up takes quite a bit to charge, but does a great job at keeping my phones charged. 3 or 4 life cycles per full charge, but it already is loosing some of it's internal battery life (mere few % now, but it worries me non the less).",4
5.0,,"July 16, 2018",Yes,I could charge my phone 2-3 times in between charging this...it was very convenient on my vaca and I would def. recommend it for the price! It charges completely overnight! :),0

5.0,,"December 18, 2016",Yes,"i have an iphone 6 and travel a lot for work. when using my phone for navigation/music/video/etc the power obv drains quickly, especially that it's an older phone. this powercore is great! it's small, so fits in any bag, even your pocket. it holds about two full charges, and you can use the phone while connected and charging. charging from almost-dead to full took about 35 minutes; you can use the phone while charging, but it will go slower..you do need a lightning cable (or micro usb depending on your device) that DOES NOT come with this package..this package contains the powercore, an accessories bag that can hold the core and is padded but breatheable, as well as a micro usb cord for charging the powercore. i bought an anker 1 ft lightning cord to go along, which also fits in the accessories bag, but is NOT INCLUDED in this package, you must buy it separately. i would definitely recommend anker brand charging cords..check out the pictures to see the packaging, size, accessories, etc..great product, has saved my ass many many times traveling around nyc. i just bought a second powercore for my partner and i'm going to be giving one to my sister in chicago, so in total i'll personally be buying this three times--i would certainly recommend you do it once!.last picture includes separately purchased anker brand 1ft gold coloured lightning cord, and shows the size/how it looks to charge and connect a phone. iphone 5 shown in demo.",12
5.0,,"January 7, 2017",Yes,These are the best Chargers not bought yet. Would recommend these to anybody that's looking for a compact back up battery for their phone. Purchased four of them as Christmas gifts with no complaints from anyone,0

5.0,,"January 3, 2017",Yes,"Excellent service during our recent trip to South America, keeping cell phone and tablet charged up during long flights and lengthy boat trips.  Too bad we forgot the charger cable for our  Canon camera, which uses that smaller-than-Micro socket.  In dim light, we did have trouble finding the little button that must be pressed to show how much remaining charge the Anker has.",0
5.0,,"September 4, 2018",Yes,This battery is a must have for every traveler who does not want to be chained to an outlet.,0
4.0,,"May 24, 2018",Yes,Works well. Got repeated full charges on my phone without the pack dying or being recharged.  Warning: it charges very very slowly. I don't use the original cable and that may be why but I've had a full charge on a spare cable take 30+ hours. For the first 10 I honestly thought it was just broken but then the next indicator light pinged on and started flashing.,0
4.0,,"June 28, 2016",Yes,"Not the best form factor. If I hold it up against a phone while walking, it is pretty hard to hold. It's not a fault that its small as heck, but it kinda gets in the way in that particular situation where you are carrying it around back to back with your phone.",0
5.0,,"August 17, 2018",Yes,"This is the first time I bought a power-bank and I chose this one, because it had good review's and it was Amazon's choice. I guess it's more expensive than others on the market, but I think it's totally worth it. The bests quality is noticeable even in packing. It looks cute and so far it's working good. So I would recommend to buy it.",0
5.0,,"April 6, 2017",Yes,Got these for my parents. They are small but have a lot of juice in them. Would highly recommend. I have one of the larger versions of this model and definitely prefer these cute small ones.,0
5.0,,"February 5, 2019",Yes,Quick charge of my iPhone. Better than expected performance.,0
5.0,,"February 27, 2019",Yes,"La compré hace más de un año y sin ningún tipo de problema, en más de una ocasión me ha sido de mucha utilidad.",0
5.0,,"November 5, 2017",Yes,"Charges devices fast and holds many charges. It's a little heavy and bulky, but that's a reasonable burden for how long it lasts. The pouch it comes with also makes storage and portability easy. This charger works so well I bought it for family members, as well.",0
4.0,,"February 14, 2018",Yes,"I'm very happy with my portable battery... Much, Much better than the one I purchased from STAPLES!.I will buy another to use as a gift.",0
5.0,,"April 3, 2019",Yes,Charges my iPhone faster than I can drain the battery. Great product! Long battery life,1
4.0,,"September 15, 2017",Yes,"I had to return my first PowerCore after it died, but Anker replaced it. Great customer service.",2
5.0,,"May 13, 2017",Yes,"They work so well I should give it a one start since someone decided to steal one out of the two I bought. I bought at a much lower price though, it was around seventeen bucks at the time.",0
5.0,,"January 26, 2019",Yes,Charges my samsung galaxy s6 to full 3 or 4 times when the charger is fully charged. Absolutely love this thing. Dropped it several times yet absolutely no damage. Such a good product,0
5.0,,"April 21, 2018",Yes,This power bank has saved me so many times. It holds a good charge and came with a nice little pouch to hold the USB cord and the power bank. It hasn't failed me in the 7 1/2 months I've been using it.,0
5.0,,"June 4, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this battery pack for my iPhone and iPad as backup power when I am on the go without access to an outlet. It charges as advertised for both devices. It is slightly heavy for its size, but that's a trade off for its power to charge at this level. The packaging was top notch, and it included a carrying case with mini-USB cable.",1
5.0,,"August 8, 2016",Yes,"What a great price for a Power Bank.  I have spent way more on one about the same size, but I love this one.  It changes fast, and it is universal, so all my friends with different phones can use it.",1
5.0,,"August 6, 2017",Yes,Tested it against my iPhone 6s Plus. Got 3-4 charges out of it before recharging the Anker. Next step is to try it on a hiking trip which is what I pitched it for.,0
5.0,,"December 23, 2016",Yes,Really great product. It holds a great charge and it doesn't get warm when charging or discharging like others I have had.,1
5.0,,"May 10, 2017",Yes,"Recharge time just as listed by others, about an hour full charge. If I didn't use it while charging, I'm sure I could get 2 1/2 charges out of it for my iPhone 6Plus. Solid product. Look forward to taking it out on the AT!",0
5.0,,"June 11, 2018",Yes,"Have used several times, to keep phone charged while on business call.  Take a short time to charge and can be used several time before needs recharging.",0
4.0,,"September 18, 2018",Yes,"I've received a replacement for a unit I received that stopped functioning within 6 months of purchase. Going on the assumption that it was a dud, plus considering the awesome customer service I've received from Anker, I've decided to update my review. The quality of the battery can't be denied. Thanks Anker!",0
5.0,,"September 4, 2018",Yes,"Small enough to fit comfortably in your pocket, good size power capacity",0
5.0,,"August 14, 2018",Yes,"Great battery, will charge items several times before it has to be recharged. Great for wilderness camping or backpacking.",0
5.0,,"December 11, 2017",Yes,I bought this to replace a charger I bought last year that had died. This one charges my phone very rapidly and fits in a small pocket. Very satisfied.,0
5.0,,"June 6, 2017",Yes,"So let me say this, I've bought 3 types of external battery packs in the last 2 years and this is by far my favorite!!  It charged my phone super fast!  It's small and lightweight.  You can carry it in a purse or even in your pocket if needed.  Anker got it right with this one!",0
5.0,,"January 21, 2018",Yes,"Use it to power my GPS on field trips, as the newer vehicles are not equipped with power ports.  Ran my Rand McNalley all day",0
5.0,,"December 11, 2018",Yes,"I use this every day. Charges quick, both phone and battery charger. Has lasted me a while now. I absolutely love it. Perfect for a person always on the go and needs a quick and efficient charge! Definetly reccomend",0
5.0,,"July 12, 2016",Yes,This power bank exceeded my expectations. Its so small and holds 2 and a half charges for my iphone 6s plus. It charges it faster than the original charger. Its just a little bit bigger than a credit card. The packaging is great. The exterior seems to be tough and durable. Comes with a Anker branded cable and pouch. Strongly recommended.,8
5.0,,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"easy to use, travels well, comes with an micro USB cable.  Apple users, recommend purchasing a short (inches, maybe a foot) cable for convenient charging.",0
5.0,,"May 20, 2017",Yes,"Perfect for quick recharges of devices (i.e. phones, Kindles, headphones, etc..)  I've used this on longer plane flights to allow me to continue using my Kindle Fire after the battery ran low.",0
5.0,,"December 18, 2017",Yes,So much power in a tiny package. I can charge my phone fully probably 4 times without charging the power bank. Great buy,0
2.0,,"January 6, 2019",Yes,"I’ve had this product for about a year and a half. It has been very handy for traveling and whatnot. However, yesterday I was using it with no problems. Today I tried to plug in the USB cord, and it won’t go in. I’ve tried multiple different cords, and nothing will fit. Pretty disappointed.",0
5.0,,"December 13, 2016",Yes,"I purchased the Anker PowerCore 10000 Portable Charger on 11/20/16.  It arrived a few days later.  It was very easy to understand the directions. I don't remember exactly, but it took about 4 hours for the PowerCore itself to be fully charged (it was only partially charged when it arrived). Then I plugged my iPhone 6s into the PowerCore 10000. My iPhone was charged much quicker than the conventional method of plugging a charge cord into a wall socket. This will be great for when I have to travel.",0
5.0,,"November 10, 2017",Yes,Absolutely invaluable for our vacation. I could get 2 complete charges for my SmartPhone and it charged quickly. Great product. Thanks. Paul,0
4.0,,"January 13, 2019",Yes,Bought as a Christmas present for a coworker but she loves it. Price a little steep but I suppose worth the hype for Anker,0
5.0,,"June 8, 2017",Yes,This power pack is AWSOME!  Quickly charges a variety of devices.  No problems with it whatsoever.,1
5.0,,"July 2, 2016",Yes,"Just what I needed. This little gadget does the job. No more worrying about my phone dying while with my mom. I can't charge my phone in the car and run her portable oxygen at the same time so I bought this. It does add weight to my purse, but it's worth it.",0
5.0,,"February 14, 2017",Yes,"Best power pack I have purchased.  Power density is good, giving you multiple phone charges from a charger about the size of a deck of cards.  Comes with a nice little back to keep the cord with it.",0
5.0,,"November 25, 2017",Yes,Love this thing. Bought it right before we went to Europe for 12 days and it was probably our groups favorite thing during our travel!,0
5.0,,"October 26, 2018",Yes,I’m obsessed with this and use it constantly! It holds a charge so well.,0
4.0,,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"I used this for a long time and I love the charger.. but, it does not work with my iPhone X for some reason. It will charge it for 5 minutes then it will stop charging..",2
5.0,,"November 27, 2018",Yes,Bought for granddaughter who is into sports. She likes it.,0
5.0,,"February 19, 2018",Yes,Works great and charges iPads fast.  But it took forever charging to get all my lights to turn on indicating  a full charge.  I am talking about 5 days at least.,0
5.0,,"February 3, 2019",Yes,Holds the charge and lasts and lasts!,0
5.0,,"December 12, 2017",Yes,Ordered this for my family during the hurricane season just in case they lost electricity. Very happy with it bought another one.,0
5.0,,"September 26, 2017",Yes,"My husband liked it. We used it on our trip to Hawaii, it never ran out- he used it 2-3x a day and charged it back up at night. If you need a fast charge, get the Anker 10050.",0
5.0,,"December 15, 2018",Yes,"I used this the day after I got it.  I was able to recharge my phone and my Kindle on a long day out, without having to fight someone at Starbucks for a free outlet.",0
5.0,,"November 4, 2017",Yes,Great purchase. Really works well. I have only charged it once and that teas 3 days ago. And it's only went down one bar. Happy I got it.,0
4.0,,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"As expected with this company. Always good stuff at an affordable price. It took a few hours to charge it up, around 3 to 4.",0
1.0,,"March 6, 2018",Yes,Buyer beware. Instructions recommend plugging into an electrical outlet for charging but it does not come with the ability to do that. It only comes with a USB cord. Instructions recommend you buy a USB charger. This is going to be returned. That information should be stated in the description.,0
5.0,,"September 25, 2016",Yes,Anker is one of the very few brands of portable chargers that actually give you the battery and storage time they claim. I'm an Anker customer for life. These making cross-country camping and cycling trips so much more tolerable.,0
5.0,,"January 27, 2019",Yes,Great item. Exactly what I wanted.,0
5.0,,"June 9, 2017",Yes,UPDATE.They took care of the issue and replaced the unit with an updated one seems to work great!!!..Worked real well for the first two months then it has slowed down on charging. Used to charge my phone in about 45 min to an hour now it takes about an hour an a half to two hours,1
5.0,,"August 8, 2017",Yes,I bought this for camping trips. I was able to get 3 full charges on my iPhone 6s (I was at anywhere from 3-5% battery when I hooked it up) and then a half charge when I got home until it finally was depleted. Definitely a great value for this device. It's also small and lighter than I thought it would be. It also charges fairly quickly.,0
4.0,,"October 5, 2017",Yes,works great! My only complain would be that the bag that came with it pretty much immediately fell apart. Does not impact the functionality of battery,0
5.0,,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"Awesome, pocket sized about the size of a credit  card and as think as a wallet. I get about four charges out of it and you can flip the charging wire to recharge the battery so you don't need to carry around an extra cable.",0
1.0,,"January 28, 2019",Yes,This product is taking so long time to be charged and charging to my mobile for long time too...their quality is so bad and comparing that the price is too expensive...,1
5.0,,"June 2, 2017",Yes,I had a charging issue with the first brick I received. Anker support was great and got my issue resolved super quickly. Charges my phone several times over. Really happy with this purchase.,0
5.0,,"December 2, 2018",Yes,Purchased Anker product because it was recommended by a family friend! This is a great product!,0
5.0,,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"This charger has been wonderful. It charges my iphone two and half times before needing to be recharged. It is bigger and heavier than I’d imagined but, well worth it for my trips to have something reliable that doesn’t need to be charged after each use.",0
5.0,,"September 20, 2016",Yes,Saved my life on long overnight train rides in Thailand and on airplane. Holds charges very well and was able to recharge my Samsung Galaxy S7 about 3 times before it needed to be juiced up again. Nice pouch to hold it in. Would definitely recommend!,0
5.0,,"June 29, 2018",Yes,"Excellent performance and price, second anker powerbank that I purchase and as always, very pleased with the product",0
1.0,,"October 21, 2018",Yes,"This charger is great and all that, but wait until you have to recharge the portable charger itself. We're talking about DAYS here. Last time I tried to charge it, I think it took 2~3 days. This makes it essentially non-rechargeable and frankly quite useless when you're outside travelling. You've been warned.",0
5.0,,"May 25, 2018",Yes,Love the charger. Great quality lasts for several charges and light weight for backpacking.,0
5.0,,"January 4, 2019",Yes,"This thing is a life saver and I pretty much use it every day.I’ve had hit for a little over a year and I’ve dropped it sooo many times, still no cracks or breaks. Heck it even survived the washing machine somehow. Definitely best money spent on amazon",0
5.0,,"September 28, 2016",Yes,"I love this company's products.  Reasonably priced, dependable, and in the event there is an issue ( I had one once with their apple charging cable) customer service is over the top responsive with their 18 month warranty.",0
5.0,,"December 14, 2016",Yes,"I purchased this as a hedge against any family member's device running out of juice during a week-long trip to a well-known Florida theme park that included two adults, two small children, and a day's worth of flights on either end of the trip.  The charger held up its end of the bargain...Moreover, it fit very conveniently in a pocket of my cargo shorts (inside a zip-top bag, of course), and I was able to carry it into the theme park to ensure we had working communications for the mobile phones all day long.  I didn't think it would turn out to be necessary, but it actually was.  Then I discovered they actually had kiosks that rent out swappable chargers for this very purpose.  Well, didn't I feel smart, having brought my own instead...Though I haven't tested this with tools, it appears to charge devices comparably quickly to their native wall chargers.  It itself charges quickly as well, from said chargers...If I had a gripe, it would be the imprecision of its charge indicator.  At the very least, the four dots should be labeled 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%.  It isn't clear whether four dots means a solid 100%, or a range from, say, 90%-100%, or 75%-100%, or what.  I would have preferred a more precise top-end indicator that could show whether it needs to be topped off a bit...It appears to hold a charge quite well.  It sat for about 2 months in between trips, and still showed ""4 dots"".  I topped it off anyway (because, who really knows what that means exactly), but, I find this more than satisfactory for what I paid...Lastly, this is minor, but the carrying pouch makes it very soft in the pocket, and is great for keeping the included charging cable with it.  I used to carry a deck of cards comfortably in my pocket, and this is no bigger than that...Bottom line:  I would buy again.",16
5.0,,"January 17, 2019",Yes,The form factor of this is way better than other power banks.,0
5.0,,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"I love this. The device itself charges quickly, and it also charges my phone quickly as well. It's not heavy at all, and the small size fits perfectly anywhere.",0
3.0,,"June 26, 2018",Yes,very slow charge and wouldn't even charge two phones. returned it as defective.,0
5.0,,"December 8, 2017",Yes,I charged a Samsung Galaxy S6 from almost 0 to 100% while the powercore was fully charged and only the first light started flashing indicating that only about 25% of the powercore had been used. The product is very simple to use and feels very sturdy.,1
3.0,,"March 17, 2018",Yes,"""suddenly stop working. Cannot charge, the LED won't lights up.""..edit:.Ok, still, I just throw away the previous charger, the charger was just broken I don;t know why. However, the customer service of the Anker was really good I think, they send me a email asking about how it breaks, what happened and was willing to ship a new one to me since it was still in the 18 months warranty.",0
5.0,,"January 19, 2019",Yes,Works great. I’ve used this on multiple trips.,0
5.0,,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"Terrific. Holds its own charge for a very very long time, charges my android and has plenty left for another time or other devices. Really a great charger.",0
5.0,,"March 16, 2018",Yes,We were able to recharge our phones 4 times with out recharging the battery charger. This will work well on our vacation.,0
2.0,,"June 22, 2018",Yes,I’m not sure if it’s because I bought the used version or not but this portable charger doesn’t even last like its description says it should. I have the bigger version as well and it’s battery life is WAYYYY better than this one. Pretty disappointed and I would’ve returned this but I don’t have the box anymore.,0
5.0,,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"Just about all of my mobile power products are Anker. Even flash lights and desk lamps. This specific item, the anker power core 10000 portable charger, I use everywhere. Recently it had been acting up but with a simple email, they went ahead and got a new one processed out and on the way to replace it. This isn't the first time Anker has fulfilled the warranty. Definitely satisfied.",0
3.0,,"March 13, 2017",Yes,At first did not work- seems to charge but does not do anything when I plug my Iphone 6 into it.  The cord is good so the battery must not work. I unfortunately only learned this after starting my trip. Anker said they would send me a new one but I have not heard back...UPDATE- Customer Service responded and sent me a new one- after my trip had concluded but they did respond well!,1
5.0,,"May 23, 2018",Yes,"This battery pack is a great investment and a must get!! Cuz If ur phone is dead I promise, it will juice u up quick. It will have u back on ur snap showing them u still lit!!",0
5.0,,"November 11, 2018",Yes,Two full charges iPhone from one charge,0
5.0,,"January 7, 2019",Yes,Stopped working and won’t hold a charge.  Update:  was contacted promptly and will be getting a new charger. Seller is very easy and willing to help fix issue.,1
5.0,,"December 5, 2018",Yes,Perfect size and charges great,0
4.0,,"November 12, 2017",Yes,"Be sure to keep up with your micro USB cable that comes with it. I tried using another one and it does not work. Read the product reviews, this is a known issue. The company confirmed it via email. Other than that it’s a good battery. Had it for 2 months so far so good.",0
5.0,,"September 26, 2018",Yes,Took this charger on a trip to Italy.  Worked great!  Fully charged 2 phones without draining battery.  Recharges quickly when plugged in.  Was very useful on long day trips.  Fits easily into purse or backpack.  Nice not having to worry about draining battery using maps etc... while traveling.  Would recommend.,0
5.0,,"June 19, 2017",Yes,"Fantastic device!  Stop searching now, this is the one.  Their service is second to none and I dare anyone to compare in the service/support area.  Easiest purchase you'll make.",1
5.0,,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"...great balance between power and size... handles all my tablets, smartphone, and iPod...",0
3.0,,"June 3, 2018",Yes,didnt come with usb or any cords as instructions indicated. take forever to charge,0
5.0,,"April 3, 2019",Yes,This is a great external charger that has excellent storage capacity. You won't be disappointed.,0
5.0,,"August 22, 2018",Yes,Great little powercell. One of the best in my opinion.,0
5.0,,"January 2, 2018",Yes,"Worked great, not enough charging hookups in my vehicle for all three kids, this helps quite a bit on longer trips, and you get several full charges off of one charge of this power brick.",0
4.0,,"February 19, 2019",Yes,"One year after buying this, the unit was not charging anymore. So I made a contact with Anker Costumer Service, and the problem was easily solved! After checking some info, they just sent a new unit,  that is now working perfectly. Very efficient and kind service! Congratulations.",0
4.0,,"May 12, 2017",Yes,Great battery. Works like a charm however the cable they sent was weak. It broke after a month or so. Anker has some HIGH quality cables and I wish they sent one of those instead of the fragile cable that this battery came with. I would have gladly paid extra. This is just be nit picking but overall Great Product!,0
5.0,,"March 9, 2018",Yes,I get about 4 chargers for my iphone with this battery. Perfect for a weekend backpacking trip...love it,0
5.0,,"August 8, 2016",Yes,"Perfect size to fit in your pocket,.comes with cord thats a perfect size to go from your pocket to your hand..and trust me you will be using that bag..I have a samsung galaxy5 and can charge my phone to 100 percent about 2 and a half times if im not using it. If i am using my phone while charging it lasts hours..Another thing i really enjoy is that the battery itself doesnt loose charge overtime. I can charge it and then let it sit for a day or two and it will still be at full charge afterwards. Very helpful all around and great size for the price.",0
5.0,,"July 16, 2017",Yes,"Great travel companion..Edit - few months later.the battery croaked, but i contacted Anker via Amazon, and within a few days they had sent a replacement..Great customer service",0
5.0,,"November 14, 2018",Yes,"Good products.  Holds up well. Durable.  Does what it says it does, and does it well for a long time.  5/5 would buy again (but I won't need to because it's such good quality).",0
4.0,,"October 3, 2018",Yes,This is a good portable charger which is what I needed.,0
5.0,,"January 2, 2019",Yes,I used this on a trip. It worked good.,0
5.0,,"November 15, 2017",Yes,These are by far the best Power Banks out there. I have bought many different power banks over the years and nothing comes close.,0
5.0,,"March 6, 2019",Yes,Anker makes the best charger. Period.,0
5.0,,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"This thing is a lifesaver during long plane trips. Charge lasts a very long time, it's very solid.",0
5.0,,"November 14, 2018",Yes,Load my iphone 4 times a lot of resistance and excellent envala,0
4.0,,"September 10, 2016",Yes,I love this quick speed portable charger. I bought it a  few months ago and have used it several times. No more waiting for a couple of hours  to get a full charge. I plan on purchasing more to give for Christmas gifts!,0
5.0,,"May 23, 2017",Yes,"Love this! It's small, not too heavy, and about the size of an iPhone 4. We can easily charge an iPhone 6s from low % to 100% about 4 or 5 times on one single charge.",0
5.0,,"October 9, 2018",Yes,Great! Easy to carry. It’s not as heavy as my others. Love the size,0
5.0,,"October 4, 2018",Yes,I love this little gadget. I put it on the charger and it charged in 2 hrs. When I attach my phone it charges very quickly and I love that I can take it on the go. It doesn't get hot which I was worried about,0
5.0,,"May 18, 2018",Yes,Love this charger.  It’s great for charging phone when traveling and out for the day!,0
5.0,,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Nice, lasts for 3 charges.  Much better than another cheaper version I bought that after one charge, it was out of juice..I like everything from Anker.",0
5.0,,"October 6, 2016",Yes,"Awesome product. Definitely deserves 5 stars. Really nice to have when you're not going to be around an outlet. Charges my LG G4 (which has a 3000mah battery) about 3.5 times. I've found that if you charge it up and don't use it for about a week, it still holds its full battery life.",0
5.0,,"October 1, 2016",Yes,"Bought it a few months back, and it's still working great. Just leave it plugged in over night to charge, and for a iphone 5s, I can get at least 3-4 charged out of it. Literally credit-card size. No complaints; it charges great. Lighter than I expected.",0
4.0,,"August 10, 2017",Yes,"I had heard pretty good things about the Anker brand and finally decided to buy a power bank. 10000maH for around $25 is a pretty good deal. Shipping was incredibly fast and while it did take awhile to charge the power bank, when I charged my phone with it, it was very quick and held the charge very well! The only reason I'm not doing five stars is I haven't had it for very long or had a chance to really get some use out of it.",0
5.0,,"August 22, 2018",Yes,"This is great. It takes a while to charge, but it charges your phone battery 2-3 times... or more.",0
4.0,,"October 28, 2016",Yes,"My second Anker charger and it works as well as advertised. It does charge incredibly fast as well! However, I only wish it was a bit smaller and lighter. This one is about the size of a pack of cigarettes, and much heavier than my iPhone. I couldn't imagine carrying it in my pocket during a music festival when I would need it the most.",0
5.0,,"November 1, 2018",Yes,I couldn’t be any happier! Great quality! Great size! Works perfectly.,0
5.0,,"October 1, 2017",Yes,"Its very long lasting, small and it Doesnt occupy much space in your bag. I do recommend to charge it overnight otherwise very good...í Havent charged it for a week and it still has battery to charge my phone. I love it.",0
5.0,,"July 4, 2018",Yes,Great seller and product! I have tried many different charger batteries and this is THE best. With my iPhone 8 Plus I can charge it three to four times with the Anker. Love it!,1
5.0,,"April 3, 2017",Yes,I finally broke down and bought one. I can't tell you how many times I borrowed my husbands. The product itself is small enough to fit into any purse/bag for the night out. It charges quickly and I am very impressed on how many charges I can actually get out of a full Anker charge. I absolutely love this item! You won't be disappointed!,0
5.0,,"September 22, 2017",Yes,This little packed worked amazingly. I got two charges on my Galaxy S8 and still had power left over. Much needed after losing power due to Hurricane Irma. A must for emergency supply kits!,1
4.0,,"November 17, 2016",Yes,"Worked great for about 4 months until it stopped accepting a charge. I'll probably purchase a new one because of how great this charger is. It is unfortunate that it failed however...Update: Anker, upon reading this review, shipped a replacement unit under warrenty. The customer service is outstanding.",0
5.0,,"March 20, 2018",Yes,Amazing powerbank. Charges my iPhone faster than lightning &amp; it still has plenty of power left over. Highly recommend.,0
5.0,,"May 12, 2016",Yes,"Bought this for a hiking trip as will have no electricity for a week or so and haven't used for that purpose yet, but when testing it around home, it appears it will be perfect for that.  We plan to buy another one if this works as well as we think it will.",0
5.0,,"July 19, 2017",Yes,small and powerful. It's saved me a few times already,1
5.0,,"April 2, 2018",Yes,Last very long. I bought it for my dad because he kept using mine and wouldn't give it back.  He love it and uses it all the time,0
3.0,,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"Pretty good charger it does the job....bought it for my mother as she works late and sometimes her phone dies during her shift.....none the less its a good portable charger, only lame thing is it only comes with a android charging cable, not a iphone : / so be sure to buy one for a iphone if you intend to use it for that...outside of that it's pretty darn good.",0
5.0,,"July 19, 2018",Yes,"Cute, compact, and charges your phone. What more can I say.",0
5.0,,"May 15, 2017",Yes,"On my feet most of the day and constantly using my IPHONE for various things, I needed a way to stay charged while I was on the move. This is the perfect solution.  Not only easy to use, it actually charges faster than any other method I've ever tried.  I've yet to come close to using the amount of charge that it's capable of providing.  This product has solved a major issue in my daily life and now it goes everywhere I go...Thank you SO much for a great product!",0
5.0,,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"A bit heavy but definitely a necessity, especially if you travel a lot. I keep this in my emergency backpack and charge it every couple days to make sure I can get the most of it at times of emergency.",0
5.0,,"April 6, 2017",Yes,"Short and sweet review, I got this after losing my previous Anker portable charger and this one is everything I could ask for! When recieving the charger it'll come with a mesh-material type of bag to keep the charger in and it'll also come with the USB to charge the device. I use this to charge my iPhone 7, and if the charger is fully juiced it'll charge my phone about 2 1/2 - 3 times. It's about the size of credit card and it's not too heavy, no cons whatsoever!",0
5.0,,"December 29, 2016",Yes,Have only used it a few times to check it out charging my phone.  The big test will be this summer when I use it to power my Garmin on my motorcycle trips.  It charged my cellphone from near dead to full four times.,0
5.0,,"August 13, 2018",Yes,I take this everywhere with me. Perfect for travel and blackouts.,0
5.0,,"June 28, 2018",Yes,This has been a lifesaver for me. I forgot what its like not to have it around!,0
4.0,,"September 17, 2017",Yes,Wish was a bit smaller. Otherwise great. Especially if traveling for long and without chargers and connecters for different countries/airports.,0
5.0,,"June 2, 2017",Yes,"My second Anker charger, purchased for additional backup when traveling, and it is the high quality I have come to expect. Just wish the cable included would have a lightning connection to use with my iPhone. I can use the cable with my phone but do wish the Powercore came with one. The Anker ""lipstick"" charger that I have had for several years did. Guess I didn't read the product description carefully enough. Again, not really a problem, just an added step.",0
5.0,,"March 24, 2016",Yes,I was always a fan of portable batteries having had iPhones for years and using my phone hard all day...had one in my briefcase one in the glovebox and a third as a back up...Anker works beautifully and is compact for its power highly recommend...I will buy again.,0
5.0,,"September 15, 2017",Yes,I used the short 1 foot USB A -C adapter that came with my Pixel XL and it would fast charge. Took phone from 15% to full in about 90 minutes and had about half left in the tank. Quite a bit of juice for such a small pack.,0
5.0,,"November 19, 2017",Yes,"This was my second anker battery.  they last long, charge my phone multiple times before dying.  I RAVE about this brand!!!",0
5.0,,"November 21, 2016",Yes,"I bought this power bank for an international trip when I would be using my phone a lot to take pictures and might be moving around and away from electrical outlets for extended periods.  My phone also has a small battery compared to the rest of its specs, so it runs out of charge much faster than other, comparable phones.  I definitely needed something to avoid running out of battery and missing out on great shots or directions or any number of things I might have needed...I ended up needing the power bank less than I had expected, but it still exceeded my expectations.  It charges my phone up very quickly, maybe even faster than a standard wall outlet does.  While I haven't done any scientific tests, I have also noticed that one charge of the power bank holds four or more charges of my phone, meaning that this device is very efficient...The mesh bag is perfect for holding the power bank and its cord and shielding them from bumps.  In my experience the cord is as long as it needs to be, without being unwieldy.  It's just long enough to allow easy use of the phone when the power bank is in an inside jacket pocket.  I can also hold both the phone and the power bank together without the cord getting in the way if I'm not wearing a jacket...Many other power banks have little extras like flashlights and pass-through charging, but after having this I can say that you don't need them.  Most will be using this to charge a smartphone or tablet, either of which function just fine as a flashlight.  And if you have the extra cord that pass-through charging requires you might as well just charge both devices separately...The Anker has all the features I need: high capacity, auto-on, a charge indicator, and in and out ports.  It even has a sleek design to boot.  I'm very glad I bought this for my trip, and now that it's over I have been continuing to carry it with me everywhere.  I won't have to worry about my battery running out on me again.",2
4.0,,"April 10, 2018",Yes,I bout this for camping and backpacking and I need a way to recharge my phone.  I got 3 full charges on my Iphone 7.... so i am happy!,0
2.0,,"July 20, 2017",Yes,"The power bank is compact and was good for 3 - 4 charges on my Pixel XL. 6 weeks later its down to 1 charge. The lights indicate its still got charge, but does not charge my phone.",0
1.0,,"April 6, 2019",Yes,I bought four of these and one of them completely stoppes working and won’t charge after one use.,0
5.0,,"March 16, 2018",Yes,Great Purchase!  Works great when you're on a trip and need to charge phone.  After first charge it stayed charged up for 3 wks.!,0
5.0,,"August 8, 2016",Yes,"This portable charger is awesome. I bought it to use at coachella, but have found it useful in everyday life. I always take it with me when I am running errands so that I can always charge my phone on the go. I will definitely be bringing this to future festivals that I attend and will also make use of it during my day to day life.",0
5.0,,"August 28, 2018",Yes,Perfect for my trip! Charged pretty fast and battery lasted along time,0
5.0,,"June 13, 2018",Yes,This charger is fabulous!  Chargers very quickly and works just as described! I’d be lost without it!,0

There are now metal parts sticking out of it and there is no way to charge it...The customer service is great and sent me a replacement, hopefully this one is better.",0
5.0,,"April 26, 2016",Yes,"I have a Nexus 5, which are known to have short battery life.  So I need to charge my phone usually twice a day.  I’ve purchased 4 portable chargers in the past couple of years.  Two of them completely failed in the first two months.  The one before this did a better job, but it was large and ugly.  I decided I wasn’t going to buy the cheapest one this time...This one is matte black and streamlined.  It’s 3 ½” long X 2 ½” wide X ¾” thick with rounded corners.  The one I had before this was also 10,000 mAh but it was an inch bigger on each side so it was impossible to put in your pocket...It’s extremely simple to use. There’s a power button which brings the four blue LEDs to life.  That gives an idea of remaining power. There’s a single USB output and a Micro USB input for recharging it.  It comes with the a 22” cord.  It does a full charge 3 times before it needs to be recharged...Today I started charging at 10 am and it was at 18%, it completed charging at 11:35 am...The company stands behind it too.  If you have an issue or a question they respond with a solution quickly.  It’s definitely worth the price...I would recommend this if looks, quality and warranty are the important factors to you.",78
5.0,,"August 23, 2018",Yes,This is a great buy.  Carry in my purse all the time.  Use it several times to charge my phone before having to recharge.,0
5.0,,"August 25, 2018",Yes,I purchased this for a week long business trip and worked exactly how I expected.  I would definitely purchase another one of these.  I just charged it with my laptop and felt like I got a few charges to my phone with it.  Still use it when I'm the road or traveling.,0
5.0,,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"Nice charger, I loved it as soon as I got it in my hands, great quality for the price and really huge charge to keep going on for hours.",0
5.0,,"February 28, 2017",Yes,I love this product. I'm able to do a double charge for my Android device. This brings me piece of mind for I'm unable to use a wall charger for over 12 hrs. Highly recommend using this!,0
5.0,,"July 2, 2018",Yes,"Great item- charges several times, keeps charge well in between. I didn’t have experience with other products but glad I chose this one. Small to fit in my bag and stretchy bag keeps all cords together.",0
5.0,,"November 30, 2017",Yes,I have ordered other Anker products as well.  My husband says these are working great.  We ordered two so he can alternate and just leave one on charge and take the other.,0

5.0,,"May 7, 2017",Yes,Great small and powerful power bank. Always good to have extra power during the day. I've managed to charge my s6 3 times ftom 10 to 100% and bank still had some juice left,0
2.0,,"September 16, 2018",Yes,It takes forever to charge to capacity. It also doesn't hold the charge as long as I expected. Will be looking for a different one. Not sure why it's a best seller.,0
5.0,,"July 6, 2017",Yes,Best portable charger i've ever purchased. Will charge your phone up to 4 times even when very low. Takes a while to charge fully but if you leave it charging over night you're set. Only downfall is only having 1 USB output to charge although there is one by this brand with 2.,1
5.0,,"January 5, 2019",Yes,Good size to carry with you and I can get 2 full charges on my Google pixel. We own 2.,0
5.0,,"February 11, 2018",Yes,"Fast charge and light. Everything I expected until 3-4 months after, it takes more than 8 hours to charge to 3 bars. Sounds like the battery is already not quite working consider I don't use it that often, it seems not right. Once I contacted them they have addressed he issue immediately with me. I’m more than happy with the purchase and would highly recommend them with the exceptional customer service.",0
5.0,,"December 9, 2017",Yes,"Fits easily in my bag, which makes it easy to travel with. It's cleared through security in my carry-on at the airport. Charges very quickly and has about 3-4 charges in it before it needs to be recharged. Smaller in height, but thicker in width, than my iPhone Plus",0
5.0,,"September 29, 2016",Yes,I actually bought 2 of these to use in conjunction with my Gearist portable solar panel. (A really good setup for backpackers).Worked well with my Samsung S5 phone and 2 different generations of Kindles.,0

5.0,,"January 7, 2019",Yes,This product performs exactly like I want it to.  It is small and compact.  I can recharge my Galaxy 8 more than 4 times without recharging the unit.  Also this unit requires nothing of me.  No learning and no buttons.  Just plug and charge.,0
5.0,,"March 9, 2017",Yes,"I bought this powerpack as a gift for someone.  They are happy with the product and can charge an iPhone 7 about 3 times before the pack needs recharging.  They can also charge an iPad with this pack.  Would buy again, I really like Anker products.",1
5.0,,"February 23, 2017",Yes,What can I say. This 10000 mah battery charger works. It charges pretty fast. You can get up to 4 to 5 charges out of it. Before you have to charge it. I highly recommend this product.,0

5.0,,"November 27, 2018",Yes,This powerbank worked very well on the first trip I took it on. On a 4 day trip I utilized the powerbank to recharge my phone and others in the group. I was able to charge my phone 3 times and partially charge others phones 2-3 times without needing to recharge my powerbank. I would highly recommend.,0
5.0,,"March 16, 2018",Yes,My nephew recommended this brand. It works very well for charging my phone when I am not at home.,0
4.0,,"August 23, 2017",Yes,Not to heavy.  Easy to pack in your purse.  I just wish I had bought it later because it was cheaper on lighting deal.  And I wish I bought the 12000,0

5.0,,"July 16, 2018",Yes,I'm  am going upstate Pa soon! I have used the Anker 10000 in the past. It's charging capacity far exceeded my needs. I have even let my friend charge her phone and I still had more power left. over!!!😊,0

5.0,,"May 17, 2017",Yes,"Amazing quality from a very respectable company in the charging business. I have owned this particular power bank for well over a year as of now and it works just as well as the first day I received it. I have dropped it on concrete, asphalt, and tile flooring numerous times (all were me being klutzy) and it has withstood these bashing very well. Great, durable quality and fast charging is what makes this product very beneficial to the buyer.",0
5.0,,"February 20, 2018",Yes,Compact and powerful. I’ve used this versatile backup battery for a number of small electronic devices. I’ve even used it to power an Amazon Tap for six hours with power to spare.,0
5.0,,"January 26, 2019",Yes,fast charging for my iPhones...,0
5.0,,"December 7, 2017",Yes,Absolutely love this charger pack! My daughter uses it a lot and doesn’t have to charge but once or twice a week! Lasts long!,0

And I have a LG product. It's important when charging this to use a better wall charge base (with USB port), mine is an LG# and it does well. I tried some older bases I had around the house and they didn't seem to charge it up.  Very, very pleased with this product.  Would recommend to others. The mesh bag that comes with it is great to keep in my purse or in the car.",0

5.0,,"October 25, 2018",Yes,This power bank was a life saver on a 10 day vacation.  It did add some weight to my purse but well worth the peace of mind to know that I can recharge my iPad once and my cell phone at least (4) times in one charge.,0

4.0,,"November 13, 2016",Yes,"Amazing product!!!!!! Love that i can charge my Samsung 7 I think at least 3 times with this thing starting from 20% battery. It does take a long time to charge fully, probably overnight. Also somewhat heavier than my phone which isn't much fun, but doable.",0

2.0,,"January 1, 2018",Yes,Will not charge my Samsung Galaxy S8 without the phone being completely turned off. I can get about 2 charges out of it if I charge while turned off.

5.0,,"May 3, 2016",Yes,"I bought this external battery instead of the PowerCore+ 10050 because the button is on the side, which works better with my outdoor setup; it really depends on your preference. I've been happy with all of the Anker batteries I've used.",1
5.0,,"January 5, 2019",Yes,Just got mine in the mail yesterday and I love it for the price. Has similar charging speed to the mophi external batteries which are much more expensive.

5.0,,"June 4, 2017",Yes,Love it. Took with me on my vacation. Comes in a little black pouch where i used to carry also the white cable for the iPhone. I would use to recharge the phone while sitting in a cafe... it charge faster than i expected and didn't even use half of its power. Great value. Great Product...,0
2.0,,"January 18, 2019",Yes,The description said smallest and lightest. It ended up being big and heavy. Thicker and heavier than my iPhone.,0
2.0,,"September 24, 2016",Yes,I bought this one to replace a 2 year old anker.  It used to be able to charge my phone and be used at the same time.  Until it charged slower so i decided to get the new one.  It does the same thing. It is draining faster than being charged. Maybe it is time to choose an alternative to Anker.,0
5.0,,"June 16, 2017",Yes,We bought this to recharge our phones at Disney World (the app was used a LOT). Kept its charge and def gave us peace of mind regarding our phones. A little larger than others (about the size of an old school pager) but charged the iphones up to four times with no issues.,1
4.0,,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"Love this!  I carry it in my pocketbook,, it lasts for days  and use it when my phone is dying.  It charges fast, And knowing I will always be able to charge my phone no matter where I am!",0
5.0,,"January 12, 2019",Yes,If I can’t rate the battery life more... I would rate it at least 10/5 stars. It’s so good and small enough to bring everywhere. This product is amazing!,0
5.0,,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"I love it. From unboxing(loved the box) it to every day use, I’m very satisfied. It’ll last me all day and I’ll leave it charging over night.",0
4.0,,"November 27, 2018",Yes,Takes forever to charge the bank,0
5.0,,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"Very fast multiple charges for my phone. More power than I need on any given day. I probably would buy a smaller product next time, mostly to reduce the weight in my shoulder bag.",0
5.0,,"July 10, 2016",Yes,I've had other portable charger and they were about double the size. This is super small and charges very fast. My other charger would take forever to charge my phone or ipad. I use this charger when I'm on the beach and need to charge my phone. It is also awesome on a plane it save me so many times. I have recommended my family members to get this and they have too. It's the best charger ever.,0
5.0,,"March 21, 2018",Yes,This is great for the price. It charges my phone very fast— use a lightening cord and it will full charge in less 30 minutes. Fine for plane travel too,0
5.0,,"November 1, 2016",Yes,"A battery pack that really delivers. Anker is a good brand. Nice heft, smaller than an iPhone. Delivers a little better than two full recharges. Good for my needs. Quick recharging",0
5.0,,"October 16, 2016",Yes,"Takes all night to charge from zero.  Small, easy to carry around.  Holds about 5 phone charges in it.",1
5.0,,"December 26, 2018",Yes,Love Anker products,0
5.0,,"October 1, 2017",Yes,It's only been a few days since I purchased; but so far it is all that I expected.  Am extremely pleased and I love the pouch that goes with it.,0
5.0,,"October 29, 2017",Yes,This is a very good charger. It charges my phone super fast. I never have to go without power now.,0
5.0,,"April 10, 2018",Yes,Very handy to have at Disney. Charges phones super fast which could be good or bad.,0
5.0,,"September 12, 2018",Yes,We have 3 in our family now. They are very handy.,0
4.0,,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"I love how this is the size of credit card. It's very light and it's so easy to carry!! I play a lot of Pokemon Go and this battery wasn't that great obviously, it says 10,000 mAh, but I felt like it didn't last long... I charged it all the way until you don't see the blinking blue lights. I use Google Pixel XL the first generation and the speed of charging is actually not that bad. I am only giving 4 stars because it feels like the battery drains pretty quick.. It felt like there's only 5,000 mAh... Which I don't mind but definitely felt like I was lied to when it says 10,000 mAh. I bought 3 total, two for my mother and my mother in saw. Something that wasn't bulky and easy to use. They had no complaints. I guess mine just was unlucky.",2
2.0,,"September 30, 2018",Yes,"After 14 months, the port where one attaches the USB cable became warped so that even if the cable is forced in, the unit will not charge. The unit worked well for the first 12-14 months - not sure what caused the warping damage as it wasn't dropped or mishandled.",0
5.0,,"August 5, 2016",Yes,"Arrived right on time. Itself charges quickly. I have an iPod and iPhone6 Plus. I think I charged each twice, pretty quickly, before needing to charge the Anker again. Very happy...Did I pick it up for backup while playing Pokemon Go? Yes. And has it worked for that? Yes...We're also going camping next week and I suspect the Anker will come in very handy in the woods, too.",1
5.0,,"July 9, 2017",Yes,The battery is very light and compact. Also charges my phone pretty fast.,1
2.0,,"August 6, 2017",Yes,Cumbersome product but last a long time.  Problem is they assume that every device is the same size?  With my IPAD cover on I can't the device into the slot.  Also the builtin Iphone cables are to short.,0
5.0,,"July 8, 2018",Yes,"This works very well, keeps a charge and charges a phone quickly.",0
5.0,,"January 7, 2019",Yes,I just received it so I haven't used it yet but I am not in the least bit concerned - I know it will be a quality product.  If it for some reason would be defective - they'll make it right.  I'll update this review if that changes.,0
4.0,,"July 26, 2017",Yes,This is a great product. Charges easily. Comes with a great little storage pouch. Be aware you need to have a charging cord for your phone to connect to the battery pack to charge.,0
5.0,,"July 20, 2018",Yes,It charges my phone and iPad 2x faster than a wall outlet! It’s as if the electricity is blasted into your device at super sonic speeds. Totally nebular.,0
5.0,,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"Great product. It charges my iphone 8 at least 3 full charges! Even though is a big ""heavy"", compared to the phone itself and other handbag items I carry around... is totally worth it",0
2.0,,"September 25, 2017",Yes,problem is that it doesnt charge my device while the power supply is also charging - not sure if its defective or just not very practical.,0
5.0,,"April 2, 2018",Yes,awesome product.  great quality.  heavy. lasts for like two days.,0
5.0,,"May 8, 2018",Yes,Took some high schoolers on a trip and boy did this thing come in handy. Charged all our phones. It became the bus pet essentially.,0
5.0,,"December 23, 2018",Yes,The one that works! Delivery was lightning fast to the point of being unbelievable.,0
5.0,,"January 9, 2018",Yes,My phone tends to lose charge rather quickly and this has saved me in so many situations. I also take it camping when I visit places where I don’t have easy access to charge my phone. Fits nicely in my purse (even my smaller bags).,0
4.0,,"July 19, 2017",Yes,It works pretty well but it does not charge my iPhone for the amount of cycles that it should. To be fair my iPhone battery has been acting up too but it charges it from 0 to 100 about three times. Its a solid and fast charge though. Decent product especially for the price.,0
5.0,,"January 17, 2019",Yes,Bought as a gift,0
5.0,,"December 20, 2018",Yes,"This battery is smaller than the other one I have. It easily fits in pocket. Has a lot of capacity, takes a while to charge so be prepared to give it some time. But it also charges my phone several times. Good product, time will tell how long it lasts.",0
5.0,,"June 6, 2018",Yes,"A family member had to be in the hospital in a country where our chargers did not work and she relied on this charger for her S8. She was in the hospital for almost 24 hours, pretty much constantly on her phone and this charger was the reason for everyone's peace of mind..This was within the first month of purchase.",0
4.0,,"March 10, 2018",Yes,It works it keeps my fone charged and I can change it more than once,0
5.0,,"October 2, 2018",Yes,The charge on this lasts forever. I took it out with me when I was out in Beijin and Tokyo and it lasted me a couple of days.,0
5.0,,"November 29, 2017",Yes,Perfect.  Small enough and light enough to not be a burden.  Charge lasts for quiet some time.,0
5.0,,"August 22, 2017",Yes,Anker makes great products.  This charger is small yet solid.  Bought 3 as gifts already and will probably buy more for Christmas.,0
5.0,,"April 14, 2019",Yes,Works amazing,0
5.0,,"March 12, 2019",Yes,Ight,0
5.0,,"May 24, 2018",Yes,Charges cellular phone very quickly and is easy to carry with you. Great purchase,0
4.0,,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"Charges slowly, drains slowly. Can get 2 full Charges on my s5",0
5.0,,"July 8, 2018",Yes,I hesitated spending the money originally but I have been very pleased with this product. I have used it to charge three items that were all less than 10 %.,0
5.0,,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"So far, seems to be working great.",0
5.0,,"February 14, 2019",Yes,This power core literally keeps a charge for so long! I had it in Mexico for a week w/out charging it at all and was able to charge 4 phones completely in the airport with battery life still on it! The sleek design fits anywhere and everywhere!,0
5.0,,"March 1, 2017",Yes,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He is pleased with the charger. Says it charges his Samsung Galaxy S4 phone fast, and he is able to get 3 full charges out of it.",0
5.0,,"June 30, 2018",Yes,"great to have when your low on power, works fast",0
5.0,,"September 3, 2017",Yes,"Great product!!  Takes a couple if hours to fully charge, but provides reliable charging of my iPhoneSE several time over.",0
4.0,,"August 27, 2017",Yes,charges my s6 quickly and does a fantastic job. comes with a lil pouch and usb cable. happy with this purchase,0
5.0,,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"I really trust tha Anker brand for all USB accessories . Great charger, frequent traveller and I couldn't live without it .",0
5.0,,"August 12, 2017",Yes,Great product and definitely worth the price. I can charge my phone and IPad. This came in handy during my trip to the Dominican Republic.,0
5.0,,"December 19, 2017",Yes,"This is an excellent phone charger, small and came in a very nice case. This is my second one and I lost the charger and tried using a similar chareger but did not work. The new charger works for both so now I have two with no regrets. Very good battery pack.",0
4.0,,"April 28, 2017",Yes,Overall this is a great product and it comes with a nice carrying pouch. It was a little bulkier than I expected it to be but still a good size to have in my purse when traveling.,0
5.0,,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"I use this everyday, at least twice a day! I charge it normally every 2-3 days. Perfect gadget. A must for a gift stocker!",0
5.0,,"April 5, 2018",Yes,It for my phone to be used to back up my communications during training and when call up on to be available for what ever comes up onemergency.,0
5.0,,"March 21, 2017",Yes,"Works great!  I bought this one and the PowerCore 20100.  This one is great for extended day trips where I need to top off my phone halfway through the day.  Kept my phone charged for a day at Disneyland and also had enough juice to charge it again that night, if I needed it.  Very happy!",0
5.0,,"July 15, 2017",Yes,"Used a few times while on vacation. Does the job, fast charging.",1
5.0,,"October 17, 2018",Yes,Happy so far. Works well.,0
5.0,,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"Love this product, it charges my phone quickly and has an extended batter life compared to other portable chargers that I've own.",0
5.0,,"December 29, 2017",Yes,This little guy will charge your phone or tablet faster than a normal outlet.  Love it!  Will fill the battery on about 3 phones OR a tablet per charge.,0
5.0,,"August 1, 2016",Yes,"Jumped on this product when it was being discounted to $15. Great buy. Charges up my iPhone 2-3 times before I need to re-charge it again. A perfect accessory for the times I am on the road for business - light, functional, even attractive.",0
5.0,,"November 17, 2017",Yes,Charges my wife's iphone 7 from 5%-100% 3-4 times. Will follow up in time with ipad mini charge cycles.,0
5.0,,"July 9, 2017",Yes,"Fully charged this for a road trip, during an 8 hour ride it charged four different phones from low battery (less than 40%) to full power. It takes a long time to fully charge the battery but once it is charged it is well worth it. This is a reliable charger for long trips.",1
5.0,,"September 4, 2017",Yes,I love this thing. It charges my iPhone 6 about 4 times on one charge. Honestly I prefer it to my iPhone wall chargers because it's faster. Awesome for work &amp; especially airplane travel. Definitely will buy again.. might even give a few out for Christmas!,1
5.0,,"December 19, 2018",Yes,"Good quality charger, not big in size, comes with a bag and USB wire as well. It charges my phone about five times on one charge from less than 5% to 100%. It takes a little time to fully charge it but lasts for days so it's worth it.",0
5.0,,"May 2, 2018",Yes,I Love this brand! I keep this in my tech bag to charge my accessories.,0
5.0,,"August 31, 2018",Yes,The product looks exactly as advertised it works awesomely lol and so far is an excellent buy. I just started using it so will give a more detailed review if things change,0

5.0,,"August 12, 2018",Yes,A great buy you won’t be disappointed.,0
4.0,,"September 12, 2017",Yes,My battery stopped working after about 25 uses. It's still under warranty so Anker promptly replaced the unit.,0
5.0,,"September 5, 2017",Yes,Excellent chrager! Love it,1
4.0,,"January 18, 2019",Yes,Great gift.,0
5.0,,"January 11, 2018",Yes,It has a high capacity charge and can be a life saver. I will get one for my daughter.,0
1.0,,"October 9, 2017",Yes,"Anker used to make reliable products, but based on this and another purchase on the same day, that no longer appears to be the case. I bought two chargers for my wife and I to use on a just-concluded trip to Europe. Unfortunately, although we didn't use either until mid-September, I purchased them far enough in advance of the trip that neither can be returned to Amazon...  My wife prefers the super-lightweight lipstick style charger. I got this one for myself. I fully charged both shortly after receiving them from Amazon, and both appeared to be in working order...  However, after using it once, my wife's charger would not recharge. We tried several times, in 3 different countries, all with the same result. As for this one, it did work and recharge for most of the trip. I believe that I recharged it twice. I take a lot of photos with my iPhone and used it to recharge the phone when we had long sightseeing days with a lot of photos taken. I think it recharged the third time also. I can't be certain because the first two of the four small blue lights which tell you it's charged status (4 lights is fully charged) no longer work. That is after less than one month of use. Since the third and fourth lights work, theoretically, I can still tell when it is 3/4 or fully charged. But, below that level, I won't be able to tell if it is charged...  This is a very disappointing development, not only because of the money spent on these units, but also because having a reliable portable charger is important to both of us, especially when we travel, and I no longer can trust Anker as a reliable manufacturer...  EDIT: Anker sent me replacements for both chargers under its warranty policy. I tried to charge the PowerCore 10000 first. It would not fully charge. I didn’t even open the box of the mini 3500. Three defective products in a row is enough. Three strikes, Anker, and you are OUT. I am sending back both the old and replacement chargers. I no longer want any Anker products in my house.",8
5.0,,"September 22, 2018",Yes,Battery lasts for a long time. I am using it to power a Raspberry Pi Zero W and it lasted for over 24 hours of continuous use. I can see where the included USB cable will eventually wear out. The included pouch is nice. Served my needs well.,0
5.0,,"November 21, 2017",Yes,I always carry those in my backpack and always comes in handy not only to charge my phone but also my GoPro.,0
5.0,,"January 22, 2019",Yes,I’ve bought several of these over the years for others as well as myself. It’s hard to beat the size/power that you get for the price. The only time I’ve ever had an issue (charger would no longer charge) they were extremely quick and sent a replacement within a few days.,0
5.0,,"June 23, 2018",Yes,Love this and will buy another of these.,0
5.0,,"June 21, 2017",Yes,"Works as described!  I love the little bag that it comes with, makes it easy to keep the cord and battery together.  The size is comparable to a men's wallet and fits in my mini purse without an issue.  I can get 4 solid charges for my iPhone or 1.5 for the iPad without a problem AND it charges the phone very quickly, which is important to me cause I don't want to be walking around with the thing attached to my phone for the next 45 minutes...GREAT BUY - worth the money...I would suggest you get one for anyone in your family, especially kids, as a matter of safety.",3
5.0,,"February 4, 2019",Yes,Charges my iPhone at least 4 times and easy to charge! Worth every penny,0
5.0,,"June 10, 2018",Yes,"Excellent performance and size, easy to carry and the best battery charge",0
5.0,,"February 26, 2018",Yes,"The PowerCore has been a life saver many times, when my devices have run out of battery power!  It goes everywhere with me and works superbly!",0
5.0,,"April 11, 2016",Yes,"For your typical smartphone this will fully charge the battery 3 or 4 times. It is very compact for its battery compacity, still still maybe a bit to bulky to just throw in your pocket. But for only 20$, this is the best all around portable charger you can currently get for a smartphone.",0
5.0,,"January 22, 2019",Yes,"I don't leave home without it.  As someone who uses their cell phone for both business and personal use, I drain my battery very quickly.  This charger has been a huge help.  If mine were lost or broke, I'd buy another one within an hour.  Great product!!",0
4.0,,"November 27, 2016",Yes,"Overall, this is a great product. I did not believe how small the charger was when I got it. Though its not Samsung-grade charging speed. It charges pretty fast. Since you are charging it on the go, it is not such a big drawback. Very simple to use and charges your phone numerous times. I have not seen a con yet, but mine is fairly new.",0
5.0,,"March 22, 2017",Yes,"I spend a lot of time away from home using my electronic devices, so I needed something I could charge, bring with me when I go out or to work, and have plenty of power to dispense...This Anker PowerCore is a great power bank, especially at its price point. It's small, about the size of a credit card, and about as thick as a wallet (depending on how hard you work or how much credit card debt you've racked up lol.)..It takes a bit to charge, maybe an hour or two from being dead, but the charge lasts quite a long time. One full charge lasts me at least two days at work (12-14 hour shifts) and from a full charge, I can charge my phone from 0% to 100% battery 3-4 times before it dents the power bank reserves. I also charge my PS Vita using this bank and it comes in handy...If you need a nice enough upgrade from the lipstick-sized power banks at the store, why not splurge and buy this? At the time of purchase, it didn't cost me *much* more than the ones at stores, which are usually 2200mAh anyway...I've had great luck with Anker products and this power bank is no exception...Plenty of battery life and very convenient to take on the go.",29
5.0,,"August 22, 2016",Yes,"The charger itself is great. It came in a clean and well organized box, holds a massive charge and works as promised. There were, however, some sizable indents in the plastic near where the ""input"" is, as if it was tested hastily. They seem the only be cosmetic, but the ""input"" does go in a little crooked. I need the charger almost daily, so I'll stick with what I have. A little disappointed that it seemed used, and the input doesn't go in straight, but overall it's great for the price.",0
5.0,,"December 10, 2017",Yes,Great product!! Will only buy Anker products for power batteries!,1
5.0,,"October 17, 2018",Yes,great to have,0
5.0,,"July 8, 2018",Yes,can last at least four separate full charges in one go.,0
5.0,,"April 25, 2018",Yes,Anker is flat out the best....untouchable for quality and awesome service.,0
5.0,,"August 31, 2017",Yes,Product works great. Product comes with 1/2 percent battery so I decided to charge my iphone 6s at 29% and within minutes it was up to 50% so it charges pretty quick. Small portable and fits in my car and backpack with ease.,0
4.0,,"December 28, 2017",Yes,"Purchased this as a gift for my mother whose phone battery is constantly low. She loves it! Very easy to check the battery level of the power core. Initial charge of the power core took approximately 7 hours, and after two full charges of my mother’s phone (android), the power core battery life only depleted from 100% to 75%. Would recommend",0
5.0,,"March 30, 2018",Yes,"Excellent product, keeps my cell phone running for hours.  Very reliable; easy to charge.  Delivered on time and as advertised.",0
3.0,,"January 17, 2019",Yes,"This is a great battery pack, but to charge the pack itself takes absolutely forever. The battery  on my phone is 4000mAH and takes less than an hour to fully charge but this pack is x 2.5 but takes 8 to 10h to fully charge. It just isn't practical.",0
5.0,,"June 28, 2017",Yes,This battery pack has saved my phone from completely depleting many times. Necessary for any long period away from an outlet.,0
5.0,,"February 14, 2019",Yes,"Excellent size I ordered it for my mother who hates to carry heavy stuff in her bag, The size of powr bank is really smaller than what I expected but the important thing she love it",0

5.0,,"December 29, 2016",Yes,"For a person with two phones, a tablet, and bluetooth headphones I can't imagine not having one these. A great investment and a solid piece of equipment.",1
4.0,,"July 13, 2016",Yes,"Just got it today and already have enough info to provide some meaningful feedback to other potential purchasers. BTW This is my 3rd Anker charger. I have a tube shaped power core mini, a larger (still working but no longer available) 2 port 13,000mAh unit and now this 10,000mAh unit...First off size is small - about the size of a deck of cards. Also considerably lighter than the 13k unit. ++ for Anker. No flashlight - but big whoop hardly ever used it anyway...First negative - you can not charge the changer and have the charger charge your phone at the same time. I could do that with the old charger - nice feature that is missing on this unit.  If it could that I'd would give it that 5",3
4.0,,"April 5, 2017",Yes,"so far so good.  keeps a good charge, but will update after I have it a while to see if it continues.  Good product for the price point as well.",0

5.0,,"January 8, 2018",Yes,Great accessory to carry on you at all times.  I get 3-4 charges on a Samsung Galaxy S6 out of this charger.  Charges devices very quickly.,0
5.0,,"October 3, 2017",Yes,"This is a really good Powerbank and i would recommend it to anyone..Comparison with my old powerbank:..Time it takes to charge the powerbank itself:.Anker: about 4h.Old pb: 6h+..Time it takes to charge a phone battery by 50%:.Anker: about 30-40 min or so.Old pb: 2h..If you are looking for a new powerbank, i recommend this 10/10",0
5.0,,"November 1, 2016",Yes,"I was very skeptical of this portable charging unit, since I had never had one before.  Recently on a camping trip my battery on my phone died, and I had no electricity to charge it, leaving me dependent on another person at the campsite for communications.  In todays technological age, this is unacceptable, so I broke down and spent themoney on this 10000mah Anker...I based my decision to purchase on several reviews I read, and the ones that were not pleased did make me concerned of the longevity of this device.  I will update the review further if I notice any problems.  I do not expect any since there is an 18 month warranty.  Time will tell...I am able to charge my Galaxy tab 8  one time, and my galaxy S6 active 2 full times on this battery charger when I start from a full bank of backup power.  The impressive part of this little unit is the size.  It packs quite the punch.  Other reviews have photos that show the size in comparison to phones.  I would post one, but for some reason I can't get the lighting right, and my pictures are not turning out in publishable fashion.  I am working to resolve this issue...This little guy comes with a mesh cloth bag to carry it, and a USB to Micro USB charging cord, I am guessing which is to charge the unit.  I have used it to charge the unit, then turn it around and charge my phone and tablet.  With the IQ technology in this power bank it does not matter.  It powers itself on when it is plugged in, and within 10 seconds of not having any current flow, it cuts off.  this is very good for me, since I have a tendency to forget and leave things on...I highly recommend this power bank for use on hikes, travel to areas where you are not sure of power availability, cruises, etc.  I hope you find your experiences to be as positive as mine!!",1
5.0,,"March 16, 2019",Yes,Good product,0
5.0,,"January 19, 2018",Yes,Amazing gadget. My iPhone 6s battery had turned to garbage and would die by 11am. This battery is slim and portable and allows me to keep my phone charged at all times. Provides about 5 full charges before I need to plug it back in.,0
5.0,,"December 3, 2017",Yes,Great products.....Keeps my cell charging while on long bike rides with GPS running ...... Recommended to 4 friends already,0
5.0,,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"Like the size, easy to carry and does 3-4 charges on my iPhone on 1 charge.",0
5.0,,"May 2, 2017",Yes,"Works excellent!  We bought this for my son to take on a long bus trip (15 hours one way).  It performed well there and back, and he was very happy to tell us that ""the power supply is awesome!""",0

5.0,,"October 26, 2016",Yes,"Love this portable charger.  I desperately needed one for my iphone 6 which does not seem to hold a charge at all if phone is in use. Read the reviews on this one and all the positive feedback was what convinced me to order it.  I'm so happy I did.  Tried it for the first time while pumpkin picking with my daughter and granddaughter.  Was out all day and not only did it charge my phone pretty quickly, it also charged my daughters phone and the charger itself still had 2 bars left.  (A full charge is 4 bars (or lights).  So I am very happy with this purchase and the low price made it even more worth it...... I had it connected to my phone while it was in my purse and phone in hand and still able to take pictures.  My daughter had it in her back pocket of her jeans while still using the phone..... Oh and it comes with a cloth pouch to hold it in, which I did not know at time of purchase and bought a hard case for it.  Did not need to buy the hard case, the cloth pouch it came with would have don the job.",4
5.0,,"December 16, 2018",Yes,Works like it says. It’s small. Easy to carry in my purse.,0
5.0,,"September 30, 2017",Yes,Works really good!!! It's a bit heavy but I can get several full charges on my phone on this thing and it's great!,0
5.0,,"January 8, 2019",Yes,My son's phone was always losing battery very quickly.  We got this and now he can charge his phone completely while at tournaments and still have tons left for teammates to charge their phones.  He LOVES this!,0
5.0,,"February 29, 2016",Yes,"Like always,  anker product are amazing!!! Cant go wrong with them. Superb quality and amazing customer service..Had an issue with a previous anker product and was emailed right away by anker representative..Good to see they care about their customers..Forever a anker customer.",0
5.0,,"March 13, 2019",Yes,Trabaja muy bien,0
5.0,,"January 13, 2019",Yes,I've had this charger for nearly two years now and it has held up. The battery life is great and the size is comfortable enough to slide into your pocket. I would definitely recommend this power bank(or the newer model) for daily use :),0
5.0,,"September 19, 2017",Yes,Performs exactly as described and packs a punch! I can count on several charges out of this.,0
4.0,,"May 30, 2017",Yes,"Basic, but does what it needs to do. Comes with a carrying case and of course is great for travel. Nice and tiny but had a decent charge time.",0
5.0,,"June 13, 2018",Yes,The product is good. It works as expected. Longer battery life and charges the mobile quickly.. worth it to buy..,0
5.0,,"October 25, 2016",Yes,So far so good. Seems to be of great quality. Holds charge well. Does take a while to charge the unit but does hold that charge very well. Charged iPhone 6 twice already and it still has a charge.,0
5.0,,"November 20, 2018",Yes,Works harder than a pimp on xmas,0
5.0,,"November 23, 2018",Yes,I love this product but it’s just blinking at 1 blue dot and I don’t think it’s charging,0
5.0,,"April 6, 2017",Yes,A lot of batteries are too small to be worth lugging around. I did some research and this seems to be the perfect compromise between capacity and portability. Although it is rather thick (.9 inches) if you wear skinny jeans or if you wear woman's pants. The slim version would probably be more usable as it's not much thinker then the USB port but it is half the size. Best battery iv'e ever had.,0
1.0,,"March 11, 2019",Yes,Won’t hold charge after less than 3 months use.,1
5.0,,"September 7, 2016",Yes,This portable Anker charger is outstanding. It is compact and easy to use. It provides a great charge for my phone and it'll do so 3-4 times before I need to recharge it which takes an hour or less. It is so compact I have carried in my pocket. I've connected it to my phone as I use it and it stays ahead of the power drain of the phone fully charging my phone quickly. I have used other portable chargers and the Anker PowerCore 10000 is by far a better charger. I highly recommend this product!,0
5.0,,"January 16, 2017",Yes,I have had it for close to a month and I love it so far. I was thinking of getting a case with backup battery but did not want to have to change out my Lifeproof case. This has worked well for my needs and it charges it up super fast. I am a lady and carry a purse so the battery pack not being attached is not a big deal to me but I can see it being a little of a hassle for a guy.,0
4.0,,"December 4, 2017",Yes,"Overall this is a great portable charger. Its compact, has a large battery, the design is nice and it works well. The only issue I ​have with this product is you have to push the button on the side of the device every time you want to turn it on. Sometimes I plug my device in and forget to push the button and it doesn't charge. Small annoyance but ill get used to it.",0
5.0,,"April 27, 2017",Yes,"i love anker products. if i'm looking for portable batteries or speakers, i always turn to anker. not only do they have great products for great prices, but their customer service is also awesome. definitely would recommend. :&gt;",0
5.0,,"July 3, 2018",Yes,Nice product. Works great.,0
5.0,,"April 3, 2017",Yes,"Fast shipping w prime!  Charges fast, love it for my teenager!",1
5.0,,"June 13, 2018",Yes,Love this charger!! I get a good three full charges on my iPhone from one charge of this! Great buy!,0
4.0,,"November 17, 2016",Yes,"This portable charger is right size and lightweight but compare to my previous portable charger, this is kind of heavy. Nice portable charger that comes handy when you on the road.",0
5.0,,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"Compact 3-5/8"" x 2-1/2"" x 7/8"".3 x 18650 cells with a good charge/discharge indicator.",0
5.0,,"August 25, 2016",Yes,"You can buy! Don't worry! It will suprise you. I had suspicious before I received mine in August 2016. I use it all business day. Because I need visit the partners and I need use Google maps to search the address. Because of that, my battery life was sucked too fast. Now I don't have any problems. I just put in my pocket and I put it charging.",0
5.0,,"June 20, 2018",Yes,"I really like it! It does what it's supposed to, which seems rare when it comes to devices to charge iPhones. I've gone through what seems like a million iPhone charging cords, but this works quickly and efficiently, and the re-charge time for the device itself isn't awful.",0
5.0,,"June 29, 2018",Yes,"I originally had one of the larger portable chargers and loved it but I wanted something lighter and more compact. This product is perfect! It's lightweight yet durable, and super convenient to carry around with me",0
5.0,,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"This thing is awesome, lasts forever, charges quickly, and is small and very portable.",0
5.0,,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"Heavy little brick, but worth the weight for 3 LG G3 charges! Perfect for backpacking!",0
5.0,,"May 11, 2017",Yes,"Fantastic, recharges my iPad Pro effortlessly.",1
5.0,,"October 29, 2018",Yes,It is great one. It’s light and capable,0
5.0,,"November 2, 2018",Yes,Keeps my Samsung Galaxy charged all day. The internal battery is dead so the phone running almost soley of this product. Also kept my 5ablet going at home for over 24 hours during a power outage.,0
5.0,,"April 6, 2017",Yes,"I needed a cell phone charger and after reading several reviews I decided to buy an ANKER Power Core 10,000 which arrived in perfect condition, very well packaged, excellent finish and working perfectly well..I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I recommend this charger and this seller. 👍",1
5.0,,"June 15, 2017",Yes,"Small and portable (comes with a handy bag so you don't lose the crucial cable). Charges devices as advertised, and the four-light indicator is adequate for monitoring remaining charge. Unfortunately does not come with a wall outlet plug, so I use my phone's standard wall-to-USB unit to charge the power bank.",0
4.0,,"May 13, 2017",Yes,Doesn't charge as fast as my halo.  But unit stays charged a long time.  Will see how good it can work at Disney keeping phone charged each day.,0
5.0,,"August 22, 2018",Yes,LOVE IT SO MUCH BOUGHT IT FOR FOUR OTHER FRIENDS AND MADE A BIG HIT WITH ALL.,0
5.0,,"October 3, 2018",Yes,I’ve had several battery chargers and this one is by far the best. Charges fast and lasts a long time.,0
5.0,,"March 29, 2017",Yes,works great. I like the fact that it doesnt have a flashlight on it. I turn the light on my other pack all the time by accident in my pocket and drain the battery.,0
5.0,,"June 26, 2017",Yes,"Friends were telling me to get the much smaller, more compact portable charger.  I decided to get this one anyways...and while it's not stored as easily as it's smaller counterpart...it charges so much more. My daughter went on a school trip to DC for several days with her class. She was the only one with a portable charger. She kept her phone charged the entire time and allowed her friends to charge their phones. So while it's not a small as the other ones, it's charging power is worth it. Just bought 2 more (one for husband and one for daughter).",3
5.0,,"October 16, 2018",Yes,Charges really fast. Small. Fast. And efficient. I love my anker. Fits perfectly in your front pocket. Charge the phone with the wire in your back pocket. Would highly recommend.,0
5.0,,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"Took this on a trip around the world. I was impressed with its battery life, even in cold areas. Durable as well, and still a good size to slip into a pocket or purse. Definitely recommend.",0
5.0,,"February 22, 2018",Yes,Anker is the brand! Got a second one for a backup to the backup.,0
5.0,,"September 29, 2016",Yes,I get 3 full charges for my Note3 off one charge on this baby...AND it charges my phone faster than the original Samsung ac charger...great small size...smaller than many chargers of less capacity...and the padded mesh bag it comes with keeps it from getting banged up in my backpack...,0
5.0,,"October 22, 2017",Yes,So far I am loving this.  It's not as light as I anticipated however it's still on the lighter side.  It charged pretty quick and look for to using it on my future travels.,0
4.0,,"September 25, 2017",Yes,"Reliable and not to big,.Only not so fun is that the cable charger quit after 6 months ago I had to buy another one another anker but via Amazon.ca.Hopefully it will last longer..Here is a picture with the new powercord",0
5.0,,"November 4, 2017",Yes,The PowerCore 10000 has been a wonderful addition to our household.  It charged our phones very quickly but was slow on recharging. After contacting Anker they made a couple of suggestions which did not help.  They then immediately sent a replacement.  The new one charges and recharges quickly.  I can't recommend it strongly enough.,0
5.0,,"March 8, 2018",Yes,This is great! Would buy again. Small and comes with its own case.,0
5.0,,"February 21, 2018",Yes,Charges my iphone about 2 times. Works great and charges pretty quickly .,0
5.0,,"January 4, 2017",Yes,Awesome product. I can now go out on my bike ride and use my cell phone with GPS all day long without any worry of running out of battery power on my 7+ .I bought a smaller Anker for my wifes 5S and it also works beautifully. Would recommend this brand to anyone looking for this type of product,0
4.0,,"April 4, 2019",Yes,"The battery is excellent: lightweight, portable and huge battery life for it's size. However, the USB cable that comes with it is not too good and the micro-USB port is loose when connecting to my phone",0
5.0,,"October 14, 2016",Yes,Excellent charger for both my LG v10 and girlfriend's Iphone 6 Plus. We use it mainly to extend our Pokemon Go playing. It is light weight so is not a problem to carry or put in back pocket of my jeans.,0
5.0,,"October 11, 2018",Yes,"This battery is easy to charge, easy to carry, and easy to use. It's saved me so many times when my battery has died. I've gone through many Anker external batteries (one of which I've used for 6 years no issues!) and they're sturdy and perform as expected.",0
5.0,,"October 31, 2017",Yes,"This is my favorite charger. A bit heavier than small ones I’ve tried, but it holds a lot of juice. Completely reliable, also. It can charge my iPhone 6+ from 0% to full, then keep it running for hours.",0
5.0,,"October 3, 2017",Yes,I love this item. I took it on a two week trip and charged it overnight to charge my phone during the day. I would buy it again and recommend it!,0
4.0,,"February 2, 2019",Yes,This power pack charges really fast.  I had mine for about a year.  It does wear down over time.,0
5.0,,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"Been using this battery pack for awhile now and I love it.  Charges fast, its small and compact so its easy to travel with.  Holds its charge and the capacity seems to be good.  Use it for my phone and switch.",0
5.0,,"April 8, 2019",Yes,I bought this to use when I traveled to Thailand for two weeks. It was very convenient as it was small and the battery life was great as it never died on me while I was using it. I used it for hours during the day as my phones battery life sucks.,0
4.0,,"April 5, 2017",Yes,"Provided several full charges to my cell phone within an hour or so.  It's been over a week that I've charged the wireless charger and it's only needing a charge now.  It's a little on the heavy side and does take a few hours to charge, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.",0
5.0,,"January 6, 2017",Yes,Bought 4 of these for the grown kids Christmas stocking and they were a hit.  Such an awesome size for this much storage.  I am jealous and I think I need to buy myself one also.,0
5.0,,"November 26, 2017",Yes,Awesome for when power goes out! (Or I need to walk around while charging my phone.,0

5.0,,"October 8, 2018",Yes,"I just took it to my first long trip and it was a life saver. Its smaller than the average wallet and it didnt feel uncomfortable in my pockets. Was able to charge my iphone multiple times, my apple watch, shared it with my friends and it still had charge!",0

4.0,,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"Works well, approximately 2 full charges for my android phone.",0

5.0,,"April 13, 2018",Yes,Incredible. Holds 2-3 full charges. It takes a while to charge itself but it’s really good for travel and on the go.,0
5.0,,"February 20, 2018",Yes,Took to disney world and the charger took very little time to charge and charge phones.  I am very pleased.,0
5.0,,"September 16, 2018",Yes,"Works as advertised, very pleased.",0
5.0,,"August 20, 2016",Yes,"Does exactly what it says on the tin, even comes with a little mesh bag that cinches so you can let the cord out without risking the whole thing falling out. Cord was long enough to go from the battery pack in my cargo pocket (what? it's summer!) to my phone in my hand with ease. Charged really quickly and I've charged my phone several times from it and haven't had to recharge the pack itself. Great for travel!",0
5.0,,"December 15, 2016",Yes,"Got it for my wife and she loves it, the best part is the size for her purse and on the technical part the auto shutoff on charging to prevent damage to the unit.",0
5.0,,"January 15, 2017",Yes,"Love it. It charges my phone at a relatively normal speed, but the best part of this charger for me is that I can leave it in my bag for weeks without using and know that when I eventually do use it, it will still have it's full charge. The pouch it comes with it also a great addition since I just keep an iphone cable with the charger so it's ready to go. It's small enough to fit into my bag for a long night/day. Just perfect!",0
5.0,,"June 22, 2018",Yes,100% recommended portable charger.,0
5.0,,"March 3, 2018",Yes,This is so far the best charger i have ever used. I use it daily at school and a class period of about 45 min it charges my phone (iphone 7 plus) from 19 to 60 percent. This charger is too good cause my friend always wants to borrow it :). I definitely recommend getting this charger just buy it it’s only $26,0

3.0,,"September 23, 2017",Yes,"First one didn't charge past half way, was returned and the replacement is doing the same thing. Can no longer return.

5.0,,"July 17, 2018",Yes,"This works so good, happy with it",0
1.0,,"December 20, 2018",Yes,Worked awesome for about 15 charges. Initially was able to charge my iPhone 6s 3x off one charge. Now it doesn’t give me one full charge. Have to purchase another. Not worth it.,0

I sent an email to their Customer Service and after some suggestions/troubleshooting, they sent me a replacement. It was a returned unit but it works fine..I couldn't be happier.",0

5.0,,"May 10, 2018",Yes,The product finally showed up close to 10 days after Amazon claimed to already deliver it. I do love the product as an earlier version I own holds its charge for a day allowing two of us to be away from a 110 V outlet. I can report back if this one is any less.,0

5.0,,"December 20, 2016",Yes,This charger is awesome.  I charged this prior to leaving for a Disney vacation.  I used it to charge my LG G5 phone once or twice a day for a week straight and never hard to recharge the Anker.

I would be nice if I could get more than about 2.5 full charges to my Samsung Galaxy S6 given that it takes a while to fully charge the external battery, but it's worth it for the size and price.  It is also completely silent.  Highly recommend!",0

4.0,,"June 21, 2016",Yes,"Charger weighs about a pound but didn't feel too heavy in my backpack.  I used this at a 4 day music festival and it charged my iPhone 6 fast each day and I still had enough power left to charge a friends phone.  One thing I do wish it came with was an Anker charger outlet plug.

Easily fits alongside phone in cargo shorts pocket.",0
4.0,,"October 20, 2018",Yes,GREAT,0
5.0,,"February 17, 2017",Yes,"So far so good.  Used it to charge my Apple Watch which runs down to about 50% power - it lasted through 9 charges.  Based on this the device should be good for 4-5 full Apple Watch charges.  Will try it next on my iPhone.  Very easy to use, small, and light weight.

5.0,,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Good for travel,0
5.0,,"August 8, 2017",Yes,It's amazing how many charges I get out from such a small package.  I got three (as stocking stuffers for my kids).,0

1.0,,"June 3, 2018",Yes,"So the charger may work fine, but charging the charger is a challenge. It requires either a computer, a USB port or a charging adaptor which is sold separately. The was not clear in the write up.  It changes the price, and the weight of what you are carrying.",0
5.0,,"January 5, 2018",Yes,"It's lightweight and an overnight charge can last for a while. Pretty much everything you need in a portable charge, and the price is good for the capacity.

5.0,,"November 15, 2016",Yes,"No problems with charging or recharging the Anker as some other reviews stated! I will say that it takes awhile to fully charge once you've depleted it fully, but it's a big battery so I guess that's to be expected. I love having this for trips or when I'm away from a power source for several hours. Good buy.",0
5.0,,"December 5, 2016",Yes,"I've only used it a handful of times, but it works very well. I only hope that it won't die after a couple of uses like another battery pack I bought not too long ago. So far, though, I'm very satisfied with it.",0

THE FACTS: takes only a few hours to charge this device out of the box when Connected To A Wall Outlet using an adapter that i already had..Charged my LG Android quickly!! don't exactly know if it was less than an hour but it was Fast. comes with a cute little drawstring mesh bag that i keep it in at all times for protection. it DOES NOT Get Hot or even warm. this is a Great Value for the price..UPDATE: JULY 17, 2017:.This is perhaps the best thing that i have purchased on amazon. it charges my smartphone so fast and it doesn't need re-charging that much. plus, using the short usb cord plugged into the wall outlet, it replenshes its battery pretty darn fast.

5.0,,"November 21, 2017",Yes,"If you have kids, you've been there.  You fork out boatloads of cash to buy charging cables and other iPhone or iPad accessories, and the little monsters rip them to shreds.

5.0,,"February 14, 2018",Yes,Works awesome,0
5.0,,"March 2, 2017",Yes,"I have purchased several Anker batteries now and I think they are great. They are cost-effective and reliable. can't beat that..Before this one with one outlet, I had the 10,000 milliamp one with two outlets for an Apple and Android. I had occasion to charge an iPhone and a Samsung simultaneously from basically zero to almost 100 percent during dinner one night. I only have an iPhone so went with the one out one this time. I also just purchase a replacement battery for my aging MacBook Pro and the battery life is outstanding..Read the directions. The initial charging/discharging info is important. Also, pay attention to how frequently you ought to use it whether you need to or not. I think that's why my first purchase could have lasted much longer than it did. Also, if you need to use the GPS for a long trip, it's immaterial if you have a car charger. It can't keep up. I always have to plug in the Anker to keep the GPS going for any length of time. Love this produvct.",1
4.0,,"August 30, 2017",Yes,After a month of use its still going strong,0
5.0,,"December 7, 2016",Yes,"This power bank is awesome and I cannot say enough good things about it. I initially purchased it to take on a recent hunting trip and it was the handiest tool I had in my backpack that week. When the hunting was slow, I could sit in the tree and play on my phone as much as I wanted without having to worry about a dead battery. The speed in which the bank charges your phone is very impressive and I believe it actually charges my phone faster than my wall charger does. The only drawback is that it takes a long time to fully charge the bank back up after it goes dead but it's well worth the wait since I can realistically charge my S5 Active 5-6 times while I'm on the go.",2
3.0,,"June 14, 2018",Yes,It works but doesn't recharge your phone very fast. It's better than nothing.,0
5.0,,"September 6, 2016",Yes,The quick charging works great with my note 7 and I usually get about 3 charges out of it. It's compact and lightweight making it easy to carry in my bag. Very reliable and I'm looking into buying one with more ports.,1
5.0,,"July 9, 2018",Yes,A lifesaver,0
5.0,,"June 19, 2017",Yes,Love it! I've had this portable battery for about a year now and I take it with me everywhere! I can get about 4+ charges in for my iPhone 6s. It even charges my iPad mini! I don't leave the house without it and it fits perfectly inside my little purse.,0
5.0,,"November 14, 2016",Yes,Bought this charger for my son and he loves it. Charges his Iphone 6 at least 5 time before he has to charge the power bank. This is the lightest and smallest charger I have seen out there too which does hold up to what you get for the price. I will definitely buy another one of these for the rest of my family members.,0
5.0,,"February 17, 2017",Yes,Amazing little product. We now own two and will never leave home without them!,0

5.0,,"June 26, 2017",Yes,Absolutely perfect.  I went backpacking and needed something to quickly charge my phone.  It's not only the perfect packable size but it charged my phone 3 times while I was out.  It still had two blue dots left when I arrived back.  I'm only disappointed I didn't buy it sooner!,0
5.0,,"April 17, 2017",Yes,It sure has a lot of power for a small device. It has the equivalent of three-four full charges. Perfect for when going far away and you have no access to plug in your phone. Convenient to carry in your pocket and it comes with a nice little bag to carry with it as well. Has done the job for me.,0

On top of that, the customer service was convenient and fast!",0
1.0,,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"Doesn’t hold a charge. Not sure why this one is a dud. I’ve used them before with no problem..I can plug it in for days, and the charger stays dead.",0
5.0,,"May 30, 2017",Yes,"I love the compact size and high capacity of this powerbank. It fits perfectly in the front or back pocket of my jeans and charges devices quite quickly. For the price, this is one of the best powerbanks, but in terms of size, it's the absolute best.",0

We left it plugged in over night and at the most will charge 75%.  Because she may carry this in her purse it would be nice to have it lighter.  And from what I can tell she has used it and it does its job of charging. (UPDATE JULY 14, 2017) customer service contacted me about lack of full charge and sent me a replacement. The replacement works great! It is still bigger than I expected but she didn't want smaller one. I switched my rating from a 3 star to a 5 star as it is an awesome portable charger!",1

5.0,,"October 18, 2016",Yes,"As I began playing Pokemon Go, a full battery on a full day's adventure just wasn't cutting it. I did a decent amount of research and read many reviews before deciding on a portable charger. I'm glad I chose this one. It's a very convenient size and charges my phone (Galaxy 4) ~4 times from 5% battery before I need to recharge the PowerCore. I've left it half-charged for a few weeks after charging my phone from dead twice, and still got 2 more full charges out of it. It also charges my phone very quickly. It seems to be only slightly slower than having my phone plugged into a wall charger. It has a solid feel and is a durable build. The only thing that I might consider a down side to this PowerCore is that it takes a few hours to fully charge when very low. Considering the amount of charges I get when it's full, and the speed at which it charges, I certainly don't deem it necessary to remove a star for this. I'm extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend it.",0

5.0,,"July 23, 2018",Yes,Perfect. The speed of charging is superb.,0
4.0,,"March 5, 2017",Yes,Purchased for my son to keep his phone charged while on his trip to New York as I knew he would be spending a lot of time taking pictures and videos. Plugged it in and let it charge overnight. In the morning I charged my iPhone 6s Plus as it was in 23% battery. In about an hour it charged it up to 95% and still kept a full charge. Charged another iPhone later that day and same great result and didn't seem to use very much charge as I still had 4 lights indicating it still had power. Three days later it's been sitting and still holds a charge. So far this charger looks like it's a winner. Great price too! I would have given it 5 stars but I haven't had it too long.,0
5.0,,"September 27, 2017",Yes,I love it. I could charge my iPhone for full 4times by one charge of Anker..Very power full!! Excellent!,0

5.0,,"June 2, 2017",Yes,"One charge of this charged an iPhone 5s from less than 30% 4 times and still has half of its charge left. It may be a bit big, but certainly stores a lot of power.",0
5.0,,"August 18, 2016",Yes,First portable charger i ever bought. Heavier than I thought but definitely saved me multiple times. Takes a while to charge but that's because it holds enough to charge my s5 3 times. Recommend for pokemon go users.,0

5.0,,"August 8, 2017",Yes,Pretty good power bank. Good appearance and nice quality.,0
5.0,,"May 3, 2017",Yes,Works great and charges up my Samsung Galaxy 7 in no time. I use it since I travel overseas quite a bit and it says it can do several charges (2.5X for the Galaxy 6 but I believe I got almost 3 charges  on the Galaxy 7. Look forward to using this when I go camping in case we run out of juice on our Galaxy phones. Yes a little heavier then some of the other Anker chargers that are good for 1.5 charges but overall small and light...Comes with a satchel to store in and micro USB cord already so I wouldn't buy one extra one till you see if this one works for you.,0
5.0,,"August 15, 2016",Yes,"As stupid as it sounds I've played Pokemon Go long enough in one session to wish I had a extra battery back up. Needing an extra charging option I did a little research and found quite a number of good reviews on Anker products. In normal fashion i took a leap of faith in peoples reviews and lucked out pretty well. I've only used it a hand full of times but it works just as advertised. The ""IQ"" charging feature which is little more than actual attempt a smart charging a phone by recognizing when it needs a quick charge or a trickle works very well. I charged my 1 year old Samsung battery in about 25-30 minutes from 15% to 100% while not using it. Haven't tried charging it when it's under heavy power consumption but a full phone charge only used about 25% of the battery so 3-4 charges is reasonable in the description. Last but not least it's only a 10000mah charger and there are bigger ones offered but for just over 20$ i say it's a reasonable price. Also being a big 6'2 individual i find the battery pretty small, it fits in a pocket or i can hold it behind my phone in the same hand. Hope this review helps you know you're basically getting whats advertised.",6

3.0,,"November 21, 2016",Yes,"This is a great charger! I love it and I would buy it again but, this charger should be used strictly at home or in an office environment. My charger lasted about two months before it started to become glitchy. Although, I am VERY rough on electronics and they tend to become quite battered. I am constantly on the go and this external battery has been dropped too many times. If you are not rough on electronics, buy it. It will last you a long time. If you are like me and clumsy, look for a different external battery.",0
