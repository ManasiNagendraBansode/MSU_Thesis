1.0,Phone constantly crashes. Battery is junk. Sold me ...,"April 12, 2017",Yes,Phone constantly crashes. Battery is junk. Sold me a piece of junk and I want my money back. Don't buy. Spend the extra cash and go through a decent company,397
1.0,One Star,"October 26, 2016",Yes,"I bought 2 iPhones with this seller, both have problems and I can't return them.",643
2.0,Need a New Battery,"April 12, 2017",Yes,I bought the phone in December 2016 and it is now April 2017 and Apple informed me that the battery has reached the end of its life and they are charging me $80 to replace it.,81
1.0,Phone stopped working altogether,"April 2, 2017",Yes,"I bought this phone in July 2016.  As of this past week, it has stopped working altogether.  I contacted the seller for assistance, and because more than 90 days had past - there was nothing they could do.  I tried working with Apple to troubleshoot to no avail.  I'm not even able to restore the phone to factory defaults using iTunes because of the error messages.  Right now, the phone won't even turn on.  At the time I purchased the phone, it was listed as a ""certified refurbished"" product.  After paying nearly $400, I would like to think that the phone should last at least a few years.  I just purchased a brand new iPhone directly from an AT&amp;T store and hope for better luck.  I will never trust ""certified refurbished"" again.",56
1.0,Bad phone never again,"April 18, 2017",Yes,The cellphone is broken and the battery is old when the technician open it up to fix it. Super bad experience,74
5.0,Legit,"April 29, 2017",Yes,Awesome shipping. Awesome product. Was better than i anticipated. You made my son a happy boy. Pop the sim card in and set it up and easy as that. Highly recommended.,21
1.0,"Item not working, have to pay out of pocket to return","July 7, 2018",Yes,"Item came with the battery not working. And the seller didn't give any return label as well, have to pay out of pocket to ship the item back..Its a waste of money. They didn't do any certification, seem to just acquire the product and re-ship to the Amazon buyers. This seller should be banned from Amazon for not meeting the quality (I can see the same issue happening to a lot of people).",17
2.0,Buy from Apple,"November 7, 2017",Yes,"Like many have already written, you take a risk with refurbished. I've never had an issue before, but this is the first time an iPhone has given me issues. Right after the warranty ended, the iOS starting causing problems. The phone randomly opens apps and periodically shuts itself off..The battery is the biggest issue. It needs to be charges 3 or 4 times a day. I literally walk around with a powerbank to keep it from dying. It will lose 50-70% of the battery within 30 minutes. It does charge quickly but it dies just as fast...Cosmetically the phone was perfect. No dents or scratches, but the battery issue is extremely frustrating.",12
5.0,Extremely pleased with this purchase,"March 17, 2016",Yes,"Extremely pleased with this purchase, at first I thought it was too good to be true but I made the Order and it was here in a matter of days and works very well no problems yet",58
1.0,Worn out battery,"March 31, 2018",Yes,Battery in this phone only has 51% capacity left meaning it won’t hold a charge long at all and it unexpectedly shuts down. On the upside Apple has a promotion going on where I could go to apple store and get a new battery for $30. I found a cellphone store that replaced it for $60 since I don’t have an apple store close by and phone works perfect.,9
4.0,Battery problems?,"April 7, 2017",Yes,"the phone comes in great condition! the only problem is when i went to charge it, it would charge for a short while then stop.I thought it would a problem with the battery but it ended up being the power cable. If anyone else has that problem i suggest you try another power cable! it worked for me and my phone works perfectly now :)",20
1.0,This phone is just an iPod Touch. Why did no one test this?,"June 23, 2018",Yes,"I like apple. I like text replacement and certain apps I am able to get. I DO NOT like receiving a phone I paid so much for that DOESNT EVEN WORK AS A PHONE. I didn’t order an iPod Touch. I ordered a phone. The caller cannot hear the recipient and the recipient cannot hear the caller. The touch screen is faulty where you have to keep touching to make something work. It will only stay connected to metro for a short time and so if I go anywhere other than home this little box is useless. To top it all off I work off my phone, and I’m losing time because of your carelessness.  I’ve never had trouble with phones from Groupon. Don’t put a “certified refurbished “ ticket in boxes if you have not tested the product personally. I’ve never been so mad. I love amazon but you can probably guess you won’t be receiving $13 a month from me anymore..The man I spoke to last night barely spoke English, didn’t are about customer service, but um hi, without us customers y’all would not be getting paid. You should consider treating us better with care and products that work.",6
1.0,Certified Refurbisher Sells iPhone6 with Broken Wi-Fi Antenna,"October 25, 2017",Yes,"This POS phone had a broken Wi-Fi antenna. I set it up before I left the US but didn't realize that the Wi-Fi only connected because I was in the same room as the router. I put it back in the box and into my luggage. When I got back to Vietnam and gave it to my girlfriend, she had problems connecting to Wi-Fi almost immediately. After a month of hearing about it, we took the phone to an Apple-authorized repair facility where they told us that the case had been almost imperceptibly bent and the Wi-Fi antenna broken. I cannot return it because I'm still in Vietnam--it's sitting in a drawer where it will stay until we need to scavenge it for parts. If the vendor is really certified to refurbish, they should have known the Wi-Fi antenna was broken.",9
4.0,Great product!,"February 17, 2017",Yes,"It was expected to arrive a week after I ordered it but to my surprise, got to me only 2 days after I ordered it. Everything came in a nice box with oem charger chord and block. The phone also looks to be in perfect condition. Great product overall and would buy again! (Update) the phone came partially charged which is helpful. Or has been 24hrs later and I do realize the phone is not holding a charge. Meaning I probably need Togo replace it with another battery for $60. A total purchase of $310 is still more affordable than some other sellers here on amazon though, so I'm not that mad. Would still recommend but fair warning on the battery~",42
5.0,"The cell phone arrived in excellent condition, no scratches","May 5, 2017",Yes,"The cell phone arrived in excellent condition, no scratches, completely new. So far I have not had any problems with it. I recommend it. I have AT &amp; T so I had no problems using it. I will continue to update this",5
1.0,Do not buy this phone,"March 22, 2017",Yes,"It comes in a brown box with just a charger, the screen has a yellow stain all around the edges, you charge it to 100% and make a 15min phone call and the battery drops to 28% totally not worth $300.",7
1.0,Phone doesn’t work &amp; CSR/technicians rude,"March 1, 2018",Yes,The volume doesn’t work on the phone we received. I have requested a call multiple times and the technician is rude and hangs up on my son. I’m currently in Japan visiting my daughter and I bought the phone for my son anyway.,5
1.0,FAKE PHONE!,"September 21, 2018",Yes,"Tried to insert SIM card to use phone and it would not connect to the cell network for T-Mobile. Took the phone into 2 different T-Mobile stores and called the T-Mobile customer service line to troubleshoot. When I called the T-Mobile they said the IMEI number was incorrect for the phone, which I thought was just because she had heard it wrong. Then after visiting the second T-Mobile store to look at other phones and troubleshoot my current phone the T-Mobile associate informed me the phone was probably a fake due to the appearance of the phone. Phone stickers said Verizon network when it was received as well with a big black dot sticker trying to cover that up. BEWARE OF FAKE IPHONES BEING SOLD HERE!!!",1
1.0,Inside of phone was corroded with paint!,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"I bought the iPhone 6 refurbished from the vendor DealFisher on Amazon in December, 2017.  The phone worked pretty good, sometimes the sound on phone calls wasn't great.  My family member who used the phone started noticing a white residue on the edges of the screen of the phone, but never paid much mind to it.  DealFisher, the vendor, offered a 90 day warranty period.  So about 110 days after I purchased the phone, the phone started losing the wireless signal.  The phone could not make or receive phone calls.  This problem was intermittent.  It would work a few hours, then it would return to ""searching"" status.  I worked with Apple telephone support, they did all they could over the phone but the problem still persisted.  I brought the phone to shop for repairs, and when the technician opened the phone, we all saw that THE INSIDE OF THE PHONE WAS CORRODED WITH OFF-WHITE PAINT!!!!  I am quite certain that no one in my family who handled the phone dropped it in a can of paint! While in my possession the phone was protected in an Otter Box and the Otter Box has not one trace of paint.  This damage existed prior to my purchasing the phone.  I contacted the vendor, who told me that my warranted had expired.  That was it, no offer to speak with anyone.",1
2.0,works but has a few issues,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"Bought new and a week later it was having problems finding a signal.  I went on the Apple forums to find a solution, and I found a temporary one.  Now 2 weeks later I'm having the signal search issue again and using the temporary fix.  But I don't want to keep using the temporary fix because who knows what else I am doing to the phone.  I will probably return it and get a 6S.",3
1.0,The phone was not appropriate. It took several tries ...,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"The phone was not appropriate.  It took several tries and many hours to get it to a full change with it then loosing that finally established charge almost instantly.  I dare say that I could have just replaced the battery.  However, in checking with AT&amp;T I was able to get a new, comparable phone for $50 more than this used one.  So..... I am returning this phone rather than spending more money and then hoping it would work properly.",2
2.0,Unimpressed,"May 14, 2018",Yes,"I thought  I was getting a good deal, but it seems like you get what you pay for. As soon as I transferred my data from my old phone, this one started to glitch and the finger print didn't work and it was slow to respond and it would freeze randomly. How could that happen, especially if I went from a 32GB phone to a 64GB? Unimpressed",2
1.0,Its not unlocked!!,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"Phone arrived in time. It looks like new, only 2 tiny scratches on the back that were no problem to me. It came dead and i connected it to the generic charger that came with it, took too long to charge and when i took it to my carrier that is metro pcs, they couldn't activated cause it was locked. Im very dissapointed since it says in the description that its gsm unlocked and it clearly isn't. Im sending it back",4
5.0,Great buy!,"September 25, 2018",Yes,"Best price compared to any other seller that I would trust. Not a fan of used electronics but considering it’s an older generation I needed, it had to be used. This was a great product! Battery life is never good on an iPhone to begin with so I was impressed that is maintained 85% capacity. I would suggest buying a case immediately because this phone is rounded off on the edges so it is very slippery and very fragile. Over all satisfied with the seller and thankful that it came with a charger.",1
1.0,So ticked off!,"May 18, 2017",Yes,Product arrived defective and glitchy. Can't charge the phone because of some crap that appears to have been stuck in the slot to charge and I guess I didn't read the info correct because it's a Verizon version and im T-MOBILE sending back for my refund!,39
5.0,"absolutely perfect, great","February 25, 2017",Yes,"Phone came in a day, absolutely perfect, great price",7
4.0,Awesome Phone,"December 21, 2017",Yes,"This phone is in excellent condition and works perfectly.  The only issue was some minor scuffs on the sides of the phone.  I wouldn't have thought much about it, if the phone hadn't been listed as like new.  Other than that it's perfect.  This phone can definitely be found for cheaper, but I felt confident buying this with the 3 month warranty.  It being certified by Amazon also gave me some peace of mind",1
1.0,The phone came in today. It worked for a ...,"December 10, 2016",Yes,The phone came in today. It worked for a couple of hours and then froze. What am I even supposed to do?,58
1.0,Faulty 'certified' refurbished phone.,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"I purchased the ""certified"" refurbished iPhone 6 from this seller on June 29th which continued to have random touch screen and battery heating issues, but only intermittently which  I ignored for a while. Now it went completely bad, touch screen wouldn't work and depletes the battery...When a phone repair shop opened it, found a clearly visible previous water damage and some rust inside.. It wasn't worth getting it repaired, just got another phone since can't return it after almost 4.5 months.",3
3.0,Be cautious when purchasing this,"August 14, 2018",Yes,The touchscreen is too sensitive and sometimes the screen will have a mind of its own and start doing weird things like opening apps and typing things. If you’re not constantly on your phone then you won’t really have to worry about battery life( on average 2-3 charges per day) it takes a long time to recharge about an average of 2hrs and 30 minuets. I was unaware that this phone is used and not new because if I was then I wouldn’t have purchased this item. They did not come with the standard iPhone earbuds and apple sticker for the phone but they did contain a 2 ft charger. The sound quality is very terrible but expected from an iPhone. If you want to listen to music loudly I recommend that you purchase a speaker. This phone is ok but I was disappointed in a few ways. Just be very careful and see if you’re able to take the risk of purchasing this item,1
2.0,Battery arrived needing replacement,"July 29, 2018",Yes,"The phone looked beautiful when it came. It already had a screen protector on and was scratchless. I quickly found, however, that using wifi, data, or calls reduced the battery by 1% or more per minute. Thinking that was excessive, I installed a battery health application on the phone. The battery design capacity is at 50% (which means 50% of its capacity relative to when it was new) and the wear level is at 49% (""Very High""). According to Apple technical specifications, batteries should be replaced when they're under 80% capacity, which means that for all intents and purposes, it's a dud battery. The screen also displays early symptoms of the dreaded iphone 6 ""touch disease"": the screen often becomes unresponsive to direction. It's hard to complete more than a single text sentence without the screen becoming unresponsive. Overall, the iphone 6 was buggy to begin with, but the factory refurbishing process should have caught the battery problem at the least, and the touch screen problem if done scrupulously.",0
1.0,Do. Not. Buy.,"July 6, 2017",Yes,"Although the phone was in perfect physical shape, it was a Japanese model (which I was not informed of nor was it posted anywhere) so the ""shutter"" sound when taking a picture was unable to be muted, turned off, or lowered!!! Unbelievable!!!! Even on photo taking apps such as Snapchat the sound still was present AND LOUD!! Had to drive all the way to the nearest Apple Store an hour away just to find out they couldn't do anything about it!! I wasted my own time and money driving around and making sacrifices for this phone to not work as advertised. Do not buy. Buy somewhere else and make sure it is a US model. Having the shutter sound go off may not be a deal breaker but trying to take pictures or videos in silence or public just isn't for me and is disrupting. Furious. Will be buying somewhere else as I have gone back to my old phone which luckily, I still had. Time and money wasted as well as patience and trust",9
4.0,"Great Iphone, Not original accessories and careful with the Iphone screen","November 30, 2017",Yes,"I got it on estimated time, the phone came with not original charger battery and headphones. I am not sure but I believe the Iphone didn't come with its original screen despite I like too much my new Iphone 6.",2
1.0,One Star,"February 10, 2017",Yes,Not working,31
1.0,One Star,"July 13, 2017",Yes,Phone was junk. Stuff didn't work,6
4.0,Great phone just no earphones,"May 7, 2017",Yes,"The phone came in a very secure box and a charger but it's not apple, had no problem setting it up to metro pcs. The reason why I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did not have headphones and not an apple charger",5
3.0,Pay attention to the seller,"August 16, 2017",Yes,"First off, be careful what seller you purchase from.  I first ordered from Kanga and they were terrible on every level.  The volume didn't work properly, the battery was trash, and they delivered later than was promised.  I returned that phone and ordered another from DealFisher.  The phone is fine but the battery is equally as trashy as the previous phone.  I'm so disappointed but I've given up finding a decent battery.  I'll just pay another $80 and get a new one.",1
5.0,Came early by my surprise and works perfect!,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"The phone came in 8 hours early and caught me by surprise. I bought the Rose Gold one with 64 gigabytes of space. Don't listen to the negative reviews the phone was new and unlocked just how I wanted it. It came in a small box protected with plastic and came with a charger, but I was kinda sad I didn't get the apple earbuds tho lmao. The battery is somewhat ok but goes out fast so I plan to buy a new one but besides that the phone is fine. I have Cricket as my provider and I put in the sim card and it works with no problems. I've had the phone for almost 2 months now and just waited just in case I had any problems but everything was fine. I would recommend buying it if you want the aux cord which was the only reason why I bought it in the first place (I'll add pictures later just lazy rn lol)...<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Apple-iPhone-6-GSM-Unlocked-64GB-Gold-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B00YD548Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPhone 6, GSM Unlocked, 64GB - Gold (Certified Refurbished)</a>",1
3.0,Trash,"August 27, 2018",Yes,"Was suspicious if this was even a real iPhone at first (it is). The warranty was way too short because after about 4 months of having the phone (warranty is 3 months I believe) the service quality dropped terribly (checked with my carrier, it wasn't a problem with them) and WiFi overall just stopped working (also checked, wasn't their fault either). Nothing I can do not even send it back. The only thing they had to offer was a discount for a new phone. Just gonna be selling this and buying a new iPhone from Best Buy, where they won't rip you off.",1
4.0,Works like new!!,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"I just got this phone and it is amazing it works just like a new one. It came earlier than expected.One con about this product is that the logo looks fake because it looks like a mirror. Also, this phone has absolute NO scratches  While I was shopping for this product I was searching and looked at reviews and I hope this helped you with your decision with buying this product.",3
1.0,Not really unlocked--WARNING!,"August 21, 2018",Yes,BEWARE. They claim it is unlocked but it may not be! The phone I purchased was supposedly a factory refurbished unlocked iPhone 6 but in reality it was locked and would not accept a new SIM card. Huge waste of time and money. Dishonest advertising.,3
1.0,DO NOT BUY. NOT WORTH IT.,"August 28, 2018",Yes,"If there were a negative star system, this phone would make the cut..The shipping took longer than the scheduled delivery..When it did arrive, it was completely dead. After charging it and taking it to Verizon for activation, the SIM wasn't reading. After several attempts, they had to reset the phone. Once activated, the screen would lag and opening apps was very slow. After only half a day, the screen went black and required another reset to get it working again..This is a certified refurbished piece of junk. After reading the reviews (with similar issues), I'm genuinely surprised that Amazon still consists business with this seller.",0
1.0,PHONE HAD ISSUES SINCE THE FIRST DAY,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"First of all the phone was a gift, upon activating the phone I noticed there was a delay with the screen sensor which I figured would get better but only got worse as time progressed. Now in order to get the sensor pad to work I have to use the side screen button to turn off screen and go back to try again. When I receive a call most of the time I cannot answer it because the sensor will not work so I have to hit the side button to cancel the call and call back after waiting for the screen to work. The phone never had water damage nor have I dropped it since receiving it. I did all the normal troubleshooting of hard-resetting and setting back to factory settings but the main issue is that it had this malfunction since day one! This company will not answer your calls or return emails either.",0
5.0,"More than I expected, great value","June 30, 2017",Yes,"This item arrived fast, in excellent condition, worked right out of the box, and came with a Lightning-USB cable, a generic USB wall wart, and an acceptable plastic case and screen protector.",4
3.0,"The phone itself was nice, but slightly bent","May 3, 2017",Yes,"The phone itself was nice, but slightly bent. My carrier is Straight Talk and I purchased a SIM card for this phone. Service worked for about an hour total and then the phone would read ""searching"" or ""no service"" in the upper left corner. I purchased three new SIM cards. I spent hours trying to resolve this issue with Straight Talk customer service and they were as helpful as could be but at the end of the day, it was a problem with the phone not reading the SIM card. The SIM card jack looked slightly bent, this may have been the contributing factor. Either way, I would warn to not buy this if you use straight talk. I went to Walmart and bought an iphone that was already set up through straight talk and it has been working fine.",1
5.0,iPhone 6 arrived sooner than expected with a very good shape (no scratches on it),"June 10, 2017",Yes,iPhone 6 arrived sooner than expected with a very good shape (no scratches on it). It turned on perfectly and unlocked well after putting my own SIM card. Looks like as it is a new phone! Worth it to purchase if you don't mind to have a non-new iPhone version.,9
1.0,Not recommending Techarvard as a reseller.,"March 23, 2017",Yes,"The battery was the first to go out less than a month with the product. Two months after the product the screen started flickering for no apparent reason, and now the power button isn't working. When reaching out to Techarvard the reseller and asking for advice or a refund the response was simply, No. This was the total sum of the advice. It was a risk buying from an unknown reseller, but took the chance and would not make the mistake again even though we were told it was certified and like new, it really isn't.",3
1.0,Horrible touchscreen,"July 25, 2018",Yes,"After about a month the touchscreen started to act up. After two, I started having to hard-reset several times a day, due to touchscreen not responding, or the phone going nuts and opening apps, closing them, calling people, etc, like someone was tapping all over the phone super fast. I’m 4 months in, and am finally at the point, even as much as I hate shopping and spending money, I am done with this phone. I will NEVER buy refurbished again.",2

I feel cheated, and I expect that some one responde for this inconveniente. I dona want to think, that this is a fraude. Now I am out of the country and is very dificulta returned",2
1.0,Japan phones! Do not buy unless you want to be locked out.,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"Do not buy these phones, they are locked on Japan networks although it's advertised otherwise. When my phone updated, the Tmobile sim card was no longer recognized. I went to the apple store to try to fix but sadly they couldn't do anything. They also let me know multiple customers have come in about the same issues and all were Amazon purchases. You might luck out with an American phone but if you buy these, make sure the FIRST thing you do is check. Easiest way, put it on silent and see if the camera still makes a sound when taking a photo. It's a law in Japan the camera sound can't be turned off.",1
1.0,Stressful,"September 5, 2018",Yes,"This is probably the worst refurbished phone I’ve ever bought. I was so disappointed. First, the phone that came wasn’t space gray, it was gold. After about a month, the phone started dying on 50 %, a week later, dies on 90%, now the phone can be on 100% and dies within minutes of it’s not plugged up. I went to a repair shop and they told me that the phone had previous water damage and the battery works fine but because of the water damage the phone had before it was refurbished, circuits are causing the battery to run dead. So now I have a bulky battery case on the phone until I Can buy a new one. Also my Touch ID won’t work, and my flashlight doesn’t work. I’ll never buy a used phone again.",0
4.0,Works like a brand new phone,"July 31, 2018",Yes,"Normally, I would never have gotten a phone online because I’m nervous of 2nd hand electronics. To my surprise the phone works like I got it new from the store! If you want to get your kid or special someone a phone without having to pay the store price I recommend this! Make sure you buy through amazon’s certified refurbished program.",1
5.0,Met all expectations.,"April 8, 2018",Yes,I bought this for my granddaughter and so far seems to be working well. It arrived a day late but but was shipped on time (postal or maybe an amazon error) The phone was as advertised. No scratches or obvious defects. The color and memory capacity are correct. The phone is unlocked as advertised. Overall I'm happy with this purchase and the seller.,0
1.0,Worst product from amazon!,"March 24, 2018",Yes,This is the worst experience I have had with amazon so far. When I received the product it looked great! I turned it on and I went through the setup and it was great!... for a week. After a week the phone just shut off and we even took it to the Apple store and even they can’t fix it. Please don’t buy this!,2
1.0,Very Disappointed,"August 13, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this phone for my son's birthday. I put it a away for a while. First of all, the phone wasn't unlocked as promised. I got that all straightened out which took a few phone calls and emails on my part just to get it unlocked... which shouldn't have been on me since it was listed as unlocked! Then, once we tried to use it,  after like a month it would only work if plugged in and now it won't turn on at all after only 4 months. Took it to the Apple store and they tried two batteries, nothing would work. I tried to get a refund from this seller but they didn't ask for more details just declined due to being past the return date. Very disappointed and out $260...",0

1.0,Proceed with caution,"January 3, 2018",Yes,Phone arrived DOA.,3
5.0,Exceeded my expectations even though some reviews were shady,"January 30, 2018",Yes,"I know some of these reviews made me nervous to purchase this phone and some seemed a bit shady, but overall I was very happy with the phone I got. Notice that when you change color, however, the 3rd party organization also changes. I got my phone from MyWit and it arrived quickly and looked new. I’ve had it for almost a month and it’s working perfectly, there was no visible damage or scratches. Would recommend but it’s always a risk buying a second hand phone.",1

1.0,Issues after update attempt,"July 27, 2018",Yes,"This phone was great until it was unable to accept updates. I tried all methods given. Then once it wouldn't update, less than 6 months after getting it, it started acting weird. The screen will come on and go off, like a slow flash continuously at random times. There's ghost touch on the screen or totally unrepsonsive. It also refused to connect to Wi-Fi sometimes. And the worst is having battery life and the phone,at random, powers off on its own. There's no warranty on it even though it's certified refurbished. This was a good phone for a short while. But not worth the money.",0
1.0,Doesn't Work,"August 11, 2017",Yes,The phone didn't work. Wouldn't even start up or charge. I tried 3 different chargers including the one that was sent to me. Still did not work so I took it to an Apple store because I didn't want to give up on the phone that easily and they confirmed that the phone does not work. They couldn't even turn the device on. Such an inconvenience because I really needed the phone hence why I did 2 day shipping.,2
2.0,The phone has high power consumption,"August 3, 2017",Yes,"The phone works well, but the power consumption drives me mad. I turn off the app background refresh and location service, and don't use the phone, it consumes 1% power every 10 minutes. After searching relevant information on the internet, I find it may be the problem on the motherboard. I will ask the seller to change another phone for me, hope it will work.",2
5.0,Phone looks like New and is working great,"April 4, 2017",Yes,Positive experience! Phone looks like New and is working great. My son loves it. I feel good about the 90 day certified product guarantee! Win all the way around. I will review again after 90 days. 😀,2
1.0,iPhone 6,"January 10, 2017",Yes,"Had to return the phone, the main problem was that the button turning on wifi would not respond.",10
5.0,Great price on a great refurbished phone...,"July 5, 2018",Yes,"Purchased two iPhone 6 phones, and read the reviews about how awful this company is. What a load of hogwash. Both phones were fully functional, clean, refurbished, and running fine. Bought one from them before. A small glitch had me send the phone back and they sent an almost new one. Most of the complaints are for the non-Apple chargers and cord, or the plain box it comes in, or their own inability to use the phone. I'll bet if you, informed Apple user, know how to use an iPhone without tech support having to do things for you, and you understand a return for service warranty and it doesn't include repairs for your part in damaging a phone, then you'll love this place for a great refurbished phone for less than what others will have to pay. My kids are thrilled, and won't put them down...",5
5.0,Phone was like new,"June 8, 2017",Yes,"The phones was just like new, however I sent back, my mistake I thought I was ordering the 6 Plus, return was no problem.",2
1.0,Do not waste your money,"November 21, 2017",Yes,"The phone arrived with a defective SIM card reader.  I didn’t know this at the time of purchase because it appeared, initially, to be a problem with my phone service provider. I would reset the phone and it would work for a few weeks, then I  would need to get another SIM card and again it would work for several weeks before crapping our again. After months of having to reset the phone and get the SIM card replaced over and over and spending far too many hours at the Verizon store and on the phone with their customer service reps, it was determined to be a problem that the phone had from the beginning.  When I contacted Aye about getting a repair or replacement, I was told there was nothing to be done because it was out of warranty. Do not waste your money. You may think you’re getting a deal, until you realize that they will not stand by their products. You’re better off going to the Apple store and paying full price. At least they will replace their products when they are determined to be defective through no fault of the buyer.",5
1.0,TERRIBLE BATTERY!!! Don't purchase unless you want to gamble whethe or not your phone will hold a charge for more than 2 hours.,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"the phone came with a fried up battery, absolutely atrocious. It barely held a charge for about an hour and 30 mins. In the end, the only 'solution' was to return the phone and re-order it with hopes to get a decent battery. Of course,e this's a game that no-one should play; therefore, I quickly walked away with my money back and a sour taste of disappointment.",2

1.0,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.,"August 6, 2017",Yes,DO NOT ORDER!! They say that the phones are referbished but my came with a dead battery. I have to keep it connected to the charger all the time and if I unplug it it dies instantly. It starts to start up and goes to the charging icon 6-7 times before it turns on. I am very disappointed with this product. I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I am. I would give this company negative stars if I could. They say one thing but send you a product that contradicts them. I would send it back but I can't because this is my only way of communicating.,2
1.0,The phone wouldn’t work. We took it into AT&amp;T ...,"April 3, 2018",Yes,The phone wouldn’t work.  We took it into AT&amp;T and Apple.  They said the phone would not work.  I have to say the company did send a pre-paid label to return it.  I haven’t received the credit yet so we will see how the rest goes!,1

1.0,FAULTY IPHONE,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"If I could give a zero star, I would. I bought a certified refurbished iPhone 6 4 months ago but it just stop working. At first I thought the battery had died but when I took it to a specialist, they said the motherboard was fried. There wasn’t any water damage or other damage that would be the cause of it. The specialist said they should have never sold the phone as it was on its last legs. When I called the company to ask for a refund or replacement, they said since it was past the 3 month warranty day they couldn’t help me. THEY SOLD ME A BASICALLY BROKEN PHONE. Do not waste your money! The only upside was that the outside of the phone looked almost brand new.",1
5.0,We received the phone in great condition and is working fine so far,"April 4, 2018",Yes,We received the phone in great condition and is working fine so far. It was 3 day later then we expected but that is the way UPS and Fed Ex is with different weather forecasts. So far very pleased.,1

I can charge my phone all night and I’m like an hour only have like 30 percent and then I turn it off and back on I all of the sudden have 60 percent! Then at like 20 percent sometimes it will just die and not turn back on but as soon as I put it on the charger is has 40 percent when it turn back on! I would buy the battery life is bad!!,1

This phone randomly shuts off. One day I go to unlock it and it just stayed black. I thought I lost it for good, but I looked up how to restart it, which is what I ended up having to do. This has happened at least three times now and more often. Don't buy. I'm sure I'll need to purchase a new phone soon. -_-",2

I have traveled UK, Canada, South Asia with his phone and changed various international GSM sim. And now buying again for a family memeber. Go for it.",0
1.0,one good/one horrible,"June 1, 2017",Yes,I purchased two of these phones for Christmas presents.  One worked well and continues to work well.  One slowly started to lose functionality whereby the screen increasingly lost sensitivity to touch.  Five months after purchase the phone is unusable.  Return these phones immediately if there are any indications of issues.,3
5.0,but in the end I'm very happy with my purchase,"November 5, 2017",Yes,"Reading these other reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy, but in the end I'm very happy with my purchase. It works with my carrier and is in perfect condition. Its an actual Iphone and I have a 90 day warranty so if anything goes wrong with the phone I am covered. It runs smoothly and I haven't had any issued with the product in any way shape or form. It's a great purchase and you get what you pay for.",2
4.0,"Good phone, battery is so-so","April 12, 2018",Yes,"DISCLAIMER: I bought the phone as a gift for someone else so my experience is merely hearsay and the one day I spent with it. That being said, I was very satisfied with the phone. The screen doesn't seem to have any scratches on it but the metal case is a little scuffed up, which is to be expected from a refurbished phone. After a couple days of use, the user told me that the phone had turned off once at 10% and then booted back up after being plugged in saying it was at 47%. So far that's the only issue they've had with the phone. Good phone and some cute a$$ wannabe-iPhone packaging, 9/10.",0

5.0,It works fine.,"August 16, 2017",Yes,"The clear film protecting the screen was loose at the corner, but that's okay considering it's refurbished.  Everything else was good as new.  It works perfectly.",3
2.0,Piece of Junk,"June 8, 2017",Yes,"When I received the phone the device could not figure out how much battery it had. I have no idea what the issue was, but the phone would constantly change the amount of battery remaining in the top corner of the screen so I had no idea what the battery level was. Fortunately I could return it back to Amazon for a full refund, but it was still a huge pain in the ass.",1
1.0,It's horrible we have bought the new iPhone,"March 8, 2017",Yes,"It's horrible  we have bought the new iPhone, but we received the phone in opened box without original box, without any documents and no pasport, we didn't get the headphones also. We are not sure that this is an iPhone,  but we are pretty sure that it is not new.",60
1.0,Did Not Turn On!!,"December 16, 2017",Yes,I received the phone and it looks great but it would not charge and wouldn't turn on. Waste of money. I would suggest not to buy from this buyer,3
5.0,Cute ladies (rose gold) phone. Give you that “boss” status!,"August 26, 2018",Yes,When I received phone I was a little skeptical about based on the negative reviews listed. Me personally O came  package neatly in a white box with the charge. Also I tested and saw everything was wiped off so it’s clean ready for any sim chip. I too love how the phone is a rose gold color. My only downside is if you love music on your phone as ringtone you will have to purchase it. Overall phone is nice I plan to take care of mine really well hope to upgrade to iPhone 7/8,0

2.0,"You’re getting a Used phone, not a refurbished one.","June 21, 2018",Yes,"Got the phone and had trouble with the ear piece. I brought it into a tech at Apple and this is what he said “I’ve worked here almost 10 years and I’ve never seen this much debris build up in an ear piece.” So no, it was not refurbished. They’re just used phones sold as “refurbished”.",0
3.0,Meh,"June 26, 2017",Yes,"It's refurbished, so it's going to have its kinks. But there is something loose in the screen so it glitches out and you have to apply pressure to make it clear again. At one points it had deleted all of my contacts and glitches out in other ways. But the phone has visible damage though",1
1.0,Who certified it? Ray Charles?,"September 18, 2018",Yes,Got the phone in April. End of August it shut down and wouldn't do anything to come back on. Told me my 90 day warranty had passed which it had but upon taking the phone apart found that the phone had been underwater at some point and it appears to have had a piece or 2 replaced in order to resell it. Take 50% of your money and light it on fire and go buy something that isn't garbage. You'll save yourself 50%.,0
1.0,"Whether you a Mom, Student or working person don't waste your hard earned money on this horrid product!","May 26, 2017",Yes,"For the first week, this worked great after that the touch screen is not working. I go to call, the person does not answer I can't end the call. I try to use an app its clicking on the top area when my finger is touching the middle or bottom area. Complete horrid product!..The person that passed this as QC really needs to loose their job. I am a single mom and putting out $300.00 is quite an expense, shame on the company or person that sold this phone as a working item...The only good thing about all of this is that I bought it from Amazon so I will get a refund. I have NEVER bought anything from Amazon that did not work. Amazon either don't sell refub products or place stronger restrictions on the vendors that sell.",4
1.0,"The only Iphone I ever purchased, and its defective","March 17, 2018",Yes,"Do NOT purchase these from Amazon site..I bought one, and flew home to my wife.In January. It's 1st usage. Barely 2 months.Old, and the phone just simply dies after it.Has been turned on for an hour or more. Once it cools off, it usually works again, TEMPORARILY",1
5.0,Just perfect!,"November 3, 2016",Yes,"This item came perfect! I love the phone and it came with everything it said it would. It is easy to use, it has absolutely no problems.",2
1.0,Although a refurbished and very new looking. During the ...,"May 10, 2018",Yes,Although a refurbished and very new looking. During the process of refurbishing an internal part that controls GPS must have been damaged. Thiss affected the Map software on the device. Even Apple was unable to fix.,0
1.0,Doesn’t take charge,"June 29, 2018",Yes,"Hey, I received the iPhone, but it’s not taking charge..As I see in 2 hours it’s only 1% charge..It’s really bad , I want to return it back now..Send my money back ASAP.",3
4.0,I enjoyed the phone however it was just slightly smaller then ...,"June 13, 2018",Yes,"I enjoyed the phone however it was just slightly smaller then I had initially anticipated. But this isn't the fault of the merchant I just simply didn't do my research. I received this item in within the specified time and enjoyed it for what little time I had however, I've since then upgraded to the iPhone 6 plus which is a lot larger in my opinion.. The downside to this item is that their seem to have been an issue with the volume, I could barley hear the callers during phone conversations.",0
1.0,Keeps shutting off.,"February 20, 2018",Yes,My son in college needed a replacement phone and this was worse than his old one. He said there's a click sound sometimes when he taps on the screen and it keeps shutting off on him with over 50% battery left.,0

So, I put it back on the charger for 10 minutes and pulled it off again only for it to die a few minutes later. Long story short, don't waste your time or money on this ""certified refurbished"" sh*t because obviously it isn't. (side note: if you were going to refurbish any part of a phone why would you skip the battery??? that's like the most important part????)",1
5.0,... this phone for 3 months now and it’s been great to me,"March 30, 2018",Yes,I’ve had this phone for 3 months now and it’s been great to me.

1.0,Having battery issues ? Does it turn off after fully charged ?,"July 16, 2018",Yes,I was really excited and happy because my last phone I had given away and I decided to buy myself a new one sadly .. when I got it I charged it and waited so I could login and we’ll that . After I unplugged it turned off . It showed the battery and how you needed to charge so I thought maybe it because it hasn’t been used in so long but then it kept doing that after charging it and I got tired of it so now I’m returning... I hope they check the phones before they sell them .,1
1.0,Screen does not work,"September 14, 2018",Yes,"We just received this refurbished item yesterday. While I know a refurbished phone is not brand new, it should work, and the screen does not work.  It freezes, and the touch aspect of the screen does not work.",1

1.0,Worst cell phone,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"Worst cell phone ever, it did not charge and when I used original apple charger it charged super slow. Then, at one point after all night of full charge, battery charge dropped to 10% drastically and the phone died in matter of second. I am never gonna buy iphones online outside of the apple original site because the cell phone was suppose to be the only means of communication with my gf when she was out of the country and I was relying on this cell phone to work. Terrible waste of money.",0

Had an Apple store check out the phone and the best response I got was its not able to be repaired. So I paid $10 a day for a phone so a full star rating is too much!,3
2.0,Terrible battery,"July 19, 2017",Yes,The battery on my phone is horrible. I charge it the majority of the day and all night long. I just used it for about ten minutes and it went from full charge to 'dead battery' and shut off. Then I can't turn it on until I plug it in and then it goes back up to the full charge until I use it for ten minimum more. So frustrating! I tried to contact the seller but didn't get a response. I guess it's time to go to an Apple Store.,1
1.0,"Battery terrible, do not buy!","August 18, 2018",Yes,"The battery in this phone is completely defective. Within less than 30 minutes of moderate use, the phone was down to 65% and then suddenly died. I checked the battery capacity and it is only 71% of what it would have been as a new phone. After recharging the phone, it continued to die suddenly - some times at 50% and other times at 80%. A refurbished phone should absolutely have a good battery installed, and I feel that the seller neglected to do this.",0
1.0,One Star,"June 10, 2017",Yes,,5
4.0,Definitely met my expectations!,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"I purchased a 64GB refurbished iphone 6 gold from MyWit. I must say the service provided by the seller was almost excellent!.1) Shipping - 5/5.It was very fast! I ordered it on Tuesday and it was supposed to arrive on Friday but came in a day earlier. So awesome job..2) Package - 4.5/5.As shown in the attached photo, the phone came in the seller's custom box with an OEM charger + USB cable. I don't think it's the same as Apple's because the material felt a bit more plastic like. However, the box came very dusty. I almost thought the iphone screen came cracked but turned out to be some dust..3) Phone - 4/5.I purposely picked this one because the description says the phone should ""look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear."" Not sure what the definition of minimal signs of wear but there are few scratches that indicate ""not new."" The first thing I noticed was this deep scratch on the back of the phone where I could see the grey part underneath the white paint. Then, there was these minor scratches/dent on the left-bottom of the phone as shown in the photo! Also the mic/earphone plugging holes have minor scratches around &amp; inside. So there's the one star I took away from..4) Performance - 4.5/5.So far everything seems to work! I received it today so I might have to wait but so far, SIM Card works; fingerprint reader works; camera works; screen has no problem; no black-out issues were observed; no obvious battery issues; and it came fully unlocked (no previous user AppleID issue). The side buttons + power button work flawlessly. The phone itself seems relatively responsive just a bit laggy. It came 67% charged and so far so good! If anything comes up, I'll try to update!",5

The phone itself looked mostly new - the only flaw was a slight discoloration around the apple logo (like where somebody had a case on it), which is covered by my case anyway. The battery holds a charge all day and I had no problems getting the phone activated at AT &amp;T. In fact, I am planning to order my husband the same phone now.",0

I'm not expecting an Apple refurbished phone at this price...A note on Certified Refurbished packaging. Seems like phones listed in Used Condition, Not Certified Condition, are still shown as ""(Certified Refurbished)"" in their description, so it's a bit confusing. If you want Certified Refurbished, look at the number of offers and filter by Certified Refurbished - this should ensure you get a refurbished phone.

1.0,Very disappointed in this purchase,"January 7, 2018",Yes,"Very disappointed in this purchase! I understood from reading other reviews that there was a chance that there could be a problem with the battery (that seemed to be the most common complaint); however, I was willing to take a chance given the price as well as the number of positive reviews...I regret the choice. The battery was completely used, once fully charged you could not use the phone for more than a few minutes before it shut down. To make things worse the screen was damaged, it was spongy (for lack of a better word) when you touched it and images would be slightly distorted (apparently this can happen when a battery goes bad, it can expand and damage the screen). Either of these issues (the battery and the screen) should have been easily identified in any sort of refurbishing process and there is no way this phone should have been sold as a certified refurbished product.",0

The other iPhone was the same model and came in great condition and I was very happy with my purchase. However, this vendor was even BETTER! The iPhone came with all iPhone accessories - charger and earbuds! I wasn't expecting that because the other iPhone I got, came with a generic charger and no earbuds AND they were the same price! I wish I just bought two of these phones! I would highly recommend this vendor to purchase your iPhone!",0

It worked with the carrier that we use which is straight talk, and we didn't have any problems activating the phone. I am completely satisfied with the quality of the phone and how easy it was to set it up. It also came with a charger which was a plus. The phone was a great deal for the price.",2

2.0,It operates fine. However the battery will say it’s completely charged ...,"February 10, 2018",Yes,It operates fine. However the battery will say it’s completely charged at 80% and my volume down button was jammed. But I use the other features to turn my volume down. Just really wished it was “like new” like I payed for. Also when I plug my headphones in I have to play around with it to get sound out of both headphones. That really bothered me because it happened to my favorite headphones.. (MDR XB450’s) I had to replace them in order for them to work “properly” so a slight disappointment tbh. Other than that the phone is fine.,1
4.0,Four Stars,"November 5, 2016",Yes,It's very good. I like it.,0
4.0,Check your battery right away,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"So far so good. Had to re start the phone once when the screen froze and I am sure to not leave it on the charger past 80%, given the iphone 6 battery needs and because the phone only came at 88% of its original design capacity. Make sure the first thing you do is download the battery life app to determine if you received a less than adequate battery in your refurbished phone.",0
2.0,Not unlocked,"March 9, 2017",Yes,The phone I ordered was supposed to be unlocked. I tried with several phone providers to get it up and running and it was not unlocked. It is only available to Sprint and Sprint does not have coverage in my area.,4
5.0,Before reading the bad reviews and considering your option,"February 2, 2017",Yes,"Before reading the bad reviews and considering your option, make sure you are aware of which seller the person bought the phone from. I bought a space grey 16 gb iphone from the seller VIP Outlet and so far the product has been great. I received it in a brown generic box including apple headphones and a charger cable. The phone looks brand new, and has no physical marks. It is functioning as good as a new Iphone, there was no problem switching my carrier over, the only thing I am concerned about is how long the battery life is suppose to run for, but since this is my first I phone I won't consider it a big deal. I recommend buying this product from VIP Outlet if you are considering getting this phone. :)",12

I had to update this phone to iOS 10.2 which I heard messed with the battery life in other phones so I don't know if this is an issue relating to that or the phone itself but it's an issue nonetheless..My phone will charge to 100% and everything is fine until I get to about 75%. My phone will drop to 14% or below in minutes and when I plug it in, the phone says it's charged 50% or so when it just told me it was 14%. It doesn't make sense!.I will update my review when Apple updates iOS to see if the issue is fixed.",1
4.0,Pay attention when switching color/memory size,"December 24, 2017",Yes,"Product was in like new condition. There was one small scuff on the bottom right edge of the phone.

I originally searched 6plus, changed the color and the memory sizes and it switched to a 6s but I didn't notice until it arrived",0

But I was disappointed to find out this was a 6. Then once I realized this wasn’t an S, and took it out of the box it had a golden halo around the Apple Logo on the back of the phone. Setting up the phone was even worse because this doesn’t come with a dummy sim for Apple Activation at setup. I wasn’t able to use it out of the box and I would never buy from them again.",1

I still went through the set up and have not been able to make a call out. All not good indications. Not to mention I'm overseas now with minimal options. I am so mad right now.,2

The only two problems I have encountered so far is that you are unable to turn off the camera clicking sound and the battery had to be replaced because it would die at 20% which got annoying when I did not have a portable charger on me.,3

One of them took the T-Mobile Sim card perfectly and the other continued to say searching and eventually said no service .  I'm ordering a second one now after being refunded for the first one and I'm hoping that it will be T mobile compatible as advertised.  Overall the only reason this product didn't get the full five stars was that one of the two iPhones did not work when I put the SIM card in. Fast shipping &amp; good quality otherwise.,1

First thing I noticed when I was unraveling the charger was that it appeared off brand, then when I plugged it in nothing changed on the battery but figured since it was in set up mode that maybe the little changing symbol just wasn't going to appear. The changer from my old phone worked when I plugged it in and I need a phone now so I'm willing to wait a little longer before deciding to return it or not.",0

I tried charging the device with the original apple charger, even though its of no use. Its still the same. The BATTERY DOESN'T LAST FOR NOT EVEN AN HOUR.

I would not recommend buying a phone through this company Best Buy offers used and refurbished phones go there first.,3

1.0,iPhone 6 with Touch Disease.,"August 26, 2016",Yes,"Right from the start this ""certified refurbished""  phone was often unresponsive and frequently froze up. The only way to revive it was to do a hard power-off and reboot it, and even that only worked some of the times. I returned the phone and three weeks later got a replacement, which was even worse: I could not even activate it, as it was frozen from the start. Some on-line research has revealed that this problem is common with the iPhone 6: it is a design problem that has been labeled ""Touch Disease"". Apparently the touch chips on the logic board often partially break off and you get intermittent electrical connections. I'll have to take it to an Apple store and see what they can do about it.",16

It turned off right after and I repeated the process. Now, it shows 50% charge. There's clearly a calibration issue or the battery is defective. How is this a ""certified-refurbished"" unit?! I would like to replace this instead of getting a refund, but i'm afraid that I will get a similar unit that's defective as well. Listen to this review and many others &amp; DO NOT BUY THIS.",4

The design and features are as good as expected for a company as successful as Apple. However, I was extremely disappointed when, after a few days having the phone, dropped it and the screen shattered to the point where it just didn't work. It wasn't thrown or dropped fromy very high. So, durability is nowhere near where it should be. This was my first iPhone, coming from a long time Samsung user. Needless to say, I went back with Samsung(GS6 edge) and am just disappointed that I wasted the money on the iPhone. Apple can't say I didn't give them a chance, however, back to the practical smart phone for me.",0

What I cared about, was the software. Soon as I turned that baby on, I was in love...Since then, the iPhone has been working perfectly.

1.0,Beware of charging Port Damage from normal use,"April 29, 2017",No,"I bought five of these for my family all around two years ago. All of them have issues with the power adapter. One of them had just come off of AppleCare and the Genius told me that I had several bent or broken prongs in the adapter. They say that dirt gets into the slot from being in your pocket or purse and then when we plugin to charge they bend. The also told me that different prongs are used to charge from a computer versus a wall charger and also to communicate with a PC.  During the life of my devices I kept buying chords thinking it was the chord going bad but turns out it's the adapters...Also Apple seems to believe in planned obsolescence because they have no option to fix. They said if it was the battery they would fix for $80 but bent prongs cannot be fixed and their only remedy is to buy another iPhone 6 for $365. They also said other than cracked screens this is the most common problem...The iPhone 7 even puts the headphones through this jack making the design flaw even more of a problem because it's using more of these prongs...If you bought AppleCare definitely go in for a free power adapter test where they check each prong before apple care expires and you can get a new phone. They told me it's extremely common to find at least one issue with a 2 year old phone so this seems to be a way you can get your phone replaced. I wish I had known as my issue appeared literally weeks after AppleCare expired and they would not honor...What's ironic is my iPhone 2, 3, and 4 old phone charging port works fine. These no longer get IOS updates from apple but I long for the days when apple meant quality",0

Do not get this phone...I had an iPhone 6 and it worked flawlessly. I connected my new iPhone 7 and it started dropping the Bluetooth connect while making calls immediately...I've done everything apple told me to do. Didn't work. Did an online search of the problem and lots of people have the same issue...So now I'm stuck with a phone that doesn't work...So this will be my last apple product.,0

Whole Back of the phone was filled with scratches and the screen was popping off. IT WAS LISTED AS CERTIFIED REFURBISHED!!!! the phone is the refurbished not brand new.

Went to a mac repair store as well as the apple store. Both told me it is a hardware problem and not fixable. The only option is to buy a new phone. Again, seller not responsive to complaints, despite offering to send it back for them to evaluate.

I have had this phone for the past 2 years and it has stayed in great condition. While I have dropped my phone several times over the past 2 years, it has never once cracked or had any issues. This product has been very sturdy, and I have not had any need to upgrade to a newer model. I can download and use just as many apps as owners with newer models can. This phone was worth the price that I paid for it. Many people with the same phone have complained about the battery life fading as the phone gets older but I have yet to experience it. This is not just for the phone I have, there was recently a case of Apple shortening the life of a battery to require customers to buy newer products. However, my phone works just as well as it did when I first got it..  I use my phone for so many different things, both for leisure and for academic uses. I use it to submit assignments when I am away from my laptop. I can stream movies off it and the lag depends on the WIFI I am connected to. I play games on it when I have time to kill. I am also an avid reader, so I can buy books and read them digitally on my phone. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. It has works very well, if it is taken care of, and would be a very useful tool. My phone is very important to me because there is important information inside. This product is well made and I feel more comfortable with it than the other models.",0

The other phone worked except the camera lens on the front of the camera is not aligned with the window, so the pictures are blurry.

1.0,The first time I bought a refurbished phone is also the last one!,"April 28, 2018",Yes,"My phone has gone, just after 2 months of use. The first month was pretty good, the machine was hotter than usual but still good. From the second month, the bad thing happened to the battery and the power, the touch was not good and the screen was open. After buying a week, I left the US for a long vacation and could not do more than see my phone dying. Actually, In fact can not live even 60 days..I thought the battery was problematic. After returning to the US, I went to Apple Store yesterday and they checked it. The technician told me that it was not the battery problem, the battery was still working fine, but hardware have a big deal, the cost to fix it $299 + Tax (Equivalent to the amount I bought this phone!). Now it's just like a paperweight, no more..The first time I bought a refurbished phone is also the last one. Thank you!",6
5.0,Very Happy,"February 24, 2017",Yes,"I bought this item a few days ago. The phone itself was in perfect condition, had the plastic film on the screen still. I easily connected it to my Metro PCS account. The shipping was SUPER fast. If highly recommend this product and shop.",10

3.0,Conflicted,"July 14, 2016",Yes,"This is a tough call because I love the phone and I feel it was a good price for the product. But, they sent me the phone which was advertised as unlocked and it arrived locked. I had to jump through some hoops and then waited more than two weeks after I paid for and received the phone to be able to use it. That being said, now that I am using it in very happy with the product.",40
1.0,Buyer Beware!!!!,"September 23, 2017",Yes,"These phones are terrible...The phone never goes to silent mode..Also every time my son tried to listen to music with his headphones it opens Siri...I can use my Amazon SD card IPhone adapter to view photos on ANY OTHER IPhone or Android, but it only worked twice on my pathetic phone..Of course, I didn't start having problems with it until after the 90 day limited warranty...These phones turned out to be worthless very quickly",4
2.0,Refurbished phone with battery issues,"July 17, 2017",Yes,"Despite claiming to be refurbished, my daughter had it for three days before the battery would be at 100%, then plummet to 20%, then switch itself off. It would turn itself back on, and stand at 12%, and drop again. This would happen until it was 'out of juice', despite having supposedly been fully charged just moments earlier. Appears to be a faulty battery, which is disappointing for a refurbished phone.",4

It looked like a brand new phone no scratches on sight even had it's original plastic and did come with off brand charger  only issue I personally had was that I forgot how small 16 gb was. I returned it because I wanted to get the 6s not the 6. Other than that no complaints,4

I figured it was a couple of bad batteries and they had fixed the problem. WRONG!.I’m on my second full charge of the day and it’s at 50% right now. I’m in a bind because I could send it back, but I won’t have a phone through the process. And, I can’t wipe the data to send it back without transferring data to another iPhone. This is what happens when you try to save a buck.",1

2.0,Fabricated Battery Age,"May 16, 2018",Yes,"This phone was sold to me as ""certified refurbished"", and yet when I took it to the Apple Store (for a myriad of problems) just under the 3-month mark of owning it, they told me that the battery could never have been lightly used when I bought the phone, as it has over 1,000 charge cycles on it, and I would only have been able to accrue 80-150 in three months. This phone was sold to me with a battery that was already past its lifespan! This was clearly NOT refurbished, and yet sold as such. I would like to return this, but it is past its return date. They should have a ""discovery of fabrication"" date for returns as well.",1
5.0,Excellent,"February 24, 2017",Yes,Totally satisfied.  Exactly what I  wanted. Thank you.,7
2.0,Buyer Beware..... Additional cost for battery replacement that dealer not willing to meet !!!,"April 6, 2018",Yes,"This is more of a dealer review than the phone. Product is fine with very minor scratches typical for a 4 year old phone. What is also typical is battery life. It drains very quickly in the cold. I went to Apple Store and had a diagnostic test which showed that battery has reached end of life to hold charge. The replacement cost is $29 by Apple Store in house. Dealer refused to meet this expense, instead opted for a prepaid, full refund to have the phone. I simply don't understand the policy of picking up the cost of return shipping, restocking the phone...... to sell to the next unsuspecting customer. I find this practice unethical..So buy it and you have to add $29 to the cost.",1
5.0,iPhone 6 Factory Unlocked Refurb,"April 24, 2017",Yes,I ordered this phone as a gift. The phone arrived in two days as specified. The phone was like new in appearance and has worked very well since receipt. I am very pleased with this phone.,3
2.0,broke but received refund,"May 4, 2018",Yes,When it first came it look perfect but after 3/4 weeks little issues began to occur. After 6 weeks the battery had gotten so bad that it would turn off at any point regardless of how long I had been charging for. On the description it said 90 warranty but I could not get in contact with the seller. Finally I spoke to someone from amazon and he said that warranty was actually only 1 month (!!) but that since I thought it was 90 days (which it says!) I was allowed to return it for a refund.,0

5.0,"Great phone, great - and honest - refurb program","February 9, 2018",Yes,"This is a review of an Amazon Certified Refurbished iPhone 6 from DealFisher (there are many 3rd party Amazon vendors who are members of the Amazon Certified Refurbished program). I chose a vendor who uses Amazon to stock and deliver for them - hence, ""Fulfilled by Amazon."" This is my 3rd purchase under the Amazon Certified Refurbished program. My earlier purchases were a pristine Apple Wireless Keyboard with Bluetooth (the one powered by AA batteries before they went rechargeable) and an iPhone 5s (for a friend to replace his dropped 5c). Both purchases were so pristine I decided to up my game with an iPhone 6 for myself and it arrived nearly as pristine - the back had a few wear marks, but the rear camera lens was perfect, the front screen was perfect, and since my Ringke case covers the rear, I'm happy as a clam. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE AMAZON CERTIFIED REFURBISHED  products. Pricing is cheaper than from other sources, and quality standards are higher - ""refurbished"" is used very loosely outside this Amazon program, and I have NEVER had the quality from other non-Amazon, non-Amazon sellers - ""refurbished"" and ""like new"" always arrived with screen rub marks, somewhat depleted batteries, etc...There are two negatives that aren't really negatives: you get no-name chargers and cables, and no earphones. I have plenty of official Apple chargers, but official Apple cables and approved cables by Anker, not to mentions more than a few Apple Ear Pods, so I'm ok...Now, on to the phone. First, if you haven't don't so already, there is an excellent Wikipedia article specifically on the iPhone 6. Second, the very technical review on performance on Anandtech dot com is a good place to go if you are a gear head...Now, my personal observations:..My iPod touch 6th gen has horrible battery life with the same A8 chip that powers this iPhone 6 (6, not 6 Plus - the 6 Plus has the A9 chip). I even replaced it at Apple once with NO improvement...This iPhone 6, on the other hand, has superb battery life. So there are other design factors affecting battery life, apparently, and the iPhone 6 is fine (yes, I know the touch has a small battery, and I am trying to allow for that)...I also have an iPhone 7, which has the A10 chip - which is supposed to be much more powerful due to the progression each year from A8 =&gt;A9 =&gt; A10, but for normal browsing and banking app use I notice no difference. So you should be pleased with this iPhone 6 in terms of performance, battery life, and screen - the screen is gorgeous. I was nervous about owning a 6, since my iPhones have been 5c, 5s, 6s Plus, and 7 - no 6 - but I shouldn't have worried...Except for ""bend-gate"". This is the generation that some YouTube gorillas were able to bend in their hands, and some early users reported sit-fown and bend issues as well. BUT the bad publicity died down, so either it was over-blown or Apple changed something. Just something to read up on in Wikipedia, not to scare you!..SO - great refurbish standards, thanks to Amazon. When ""Fulfilled by Amazon,"" all the goodness of Amazon shipping including Amazon Lockers. And, a fine phone, still more up to date than I am!",2

When I got the phone everything was as expected. Then I got a call and when I tried talking to them, they said there was a lot of noise in the background, but there was no noise on my end or in my background. So I called a few more people and Everyone said the same thing, so I had to hear it for my self, and it was horrible. Currently I am returning it. The phone is in the mail. Basically it sucks paying that much money for a faulty phone and I would've been ok with just exchanging for another phone but all they could do is give me my money back or amazon credit (which isn't bad but I've already been through that process of searching for a phone).",4

BUT since I got it a couple days ago, it's started to act like I'm opening apps or typing things when I'm not touching it, and, separately, not responding to the things I am actually trying to do.  I took off the protective glass screen cover I've had on it since the beginning to see if that was the problem, but no.  It also, every time I unlock it, asks ""Do you want to enable automatic downloads on this device"" which I don't particularly, but since it didn't give me options other than ""yes"" or ""cancel"" and hitting cancel just meant I would gt the same notification again next time I unlocked the phone, I figured I might as well, if only to stop the notification.  but it won't let me enable automatic downloads.  When I move the slider to yes, it stays there for half a second and then slides back to no.  Very frustrating.  I will be returning this phone and buying something else.",5

1.0,Have had it less than 24 hours and the battery cant hold a charge,"March 1, 2017",Yes,"This is a great phone aside for the fact i have had it for less than 24 hours and the phone can't hold a charge after speaking with apple support i now have to go into the apple store a get the battery replaced for $80! Yeah $80 isn't a lot but the fact that in the description the phone was listed as ""like new"" to me that should mean that the battery is fully functioning! So now i have to go shell out more money for the battery to be replaced yeah not happy will not order from this dealer again!",1
3.0,"Looks great, but I cannot disable the camera shutter noise.","August 14, 2017",Yes,"This phone is most likely from Japan (they have laws requiring the shutter noise) as I cannot disable the camera shutter noise!! I can work around it by using Instagram in silent mode, but I was not warned before buying the product..The phone is in great shape otherwise. You don't realize how big of an inconvenience not being able to disable the shutter is until you try to Snapchat. Alas, a first world problem... So, I am happy I have a phone!",0
5.0,The iPhone was in perfect condition when it arrived,"April 28, 2017",Yes,"The iPhone was in perfect condition when it arrived, only 4 days after I ordered it. I've been using it for over 5 months and I've had not problems. I've dropped it several times from waist level, but from higher occasionally (with a case obviously) and it still works fine. I have been satisfied with the speed at which it runs. My expectations were met and I have no complaints regarding the iPhone.",1
4.0,Arrived in great condition. No scratches or dings,"April 17, 2017",Yes,Arrived in great condition. No scratches or dings. I have heard this with many refurbished phones and it stands true with this one the battery is not great. It does last most of the day but does almost immediately if you open any apps once the battery gets to 30%. Also dies quickly if it gets cold (my old iPhone did this too). Overall for the price I am very happy,0
4.0,Pleased but an opportunity missed.,"July 6, 2016",Yes,"I was concerned about ordering a refurbished phone. But there were only 2 very small abrasions on the entire phone. The phone runs great and works as a iPhone should. My only regret is that I didn't look at the iPhone SE As I prefer the smaller 4 inch display. It's also faster and has better overall specs than the 6 and it was only $65 more. But if you prefer the larger display then I would recommend this. No problems with my AT&amp;T SIM card, just popped it in before I turned the phone on and it worked just fine.",1
1.0,WARNING HORRIBLY DAMAGED!!,"May 29, 2016",Yes,WARNING DO NOT BUY this item!!! Save yourself the headache and frustration from buying this phone!.It came water DAMAGED with a BIG red spot on the left side of the screen. The packaging it came in looked getto and beyond used..,2

I couldn't save any contact,  send a text,  take a picture and many other things.  The only thing I could do was to place a call. Please don't sale stuff like that.",1
4.0,Getting the Data working is a pain.,"June 1, 2016",Yes,"The phone is great. I have it set up as a tracfone. Getting the Data working was a bit of pain. God bless them, but tracfone support are helpless when it comes to B.Y.O.phone. Turns out that to get the data to work you have to set up the A.P.N and M.M.C.S on an i-phone 6 but i.O.S will not let you manually adjust the settings. The link tracfone provides for setting up this profile Did Not Work, for me at any rate. After a lot of google research I discovered this app that sets it up for you, Unlockit.co.nz it worked like a dream. Now I have phone and data. I already had a tracfone log in so all I had left to do was down load the tracfone app from the app store so I could monitor my available minutes, s.m.s and data..I hope this helps others avoid a lot of frustration. Oh, and straight talk is basically tracfone so this might help those users as well..The phone itself looks brand new as far as I can tell. No scratches or ware and tare of any kind. No ear buds (as expected) but it did come with the wall charger and lighting to USB cable. Call clarity has improved (compared to i-phone 4) and Siri can be useful at times. I have also used the google maps navigation app and it is an adequate replacement for a stand alone GPS..I highly recommend getting some kind of cover/case. You don't really need a screen protector thanks to gorilla glass, but you will regret dropping this phone as the corners will show impacts. It is a slippery little devil, it almost jumps out of your hand like the ""precious"" thing it is..I think the size is just right and the ""reach"" feature is helpful. The only thing that would be better is battery life, and for the love of god let me expand the memory. This is the primary reason it only rates 4 stars.",2
4.0,You may want to dress it up a bit if you are giving as a gift...but the product itself is fine,"January 10, 2017",Yes,"It seems great so far.  We purchased as a gift and were disappointed in the presentation.  Protective shields slapped on sloppily with tons of air bubbles, changer in a plastic bag.  No ear buds.  We added a protective shield to the glass and added new ear buds.  The packaging did seem sturdy enough though and the product seems fine.  Just don't expect it to show up in all of it's original Apple glory!",0

It not only took way longer than what it was supposed to (10days) for me to be able to get it; but it also looked dirty and with some type of glue/sticky thing on the screen and in the back, which made it look terrible as the first impression once the box was open. I dont even know if it works fine or not because I didn't even feel like trying after waiting for so long and seeing it like that once I got it.",1

Will not be buying a third from this seller...1st phone - came in good packaging with a very cheap charger. The body of the phone had deep gray scratches in it, which I could deal with. However, then I noticed the camera wouldn't focus. Upon further inspection I found there was a dead pixel AND what looked to be a hair trapped in the lens. Deal breaker - returned it and was refunded without hassle...2nd phone - thought maybe I had just gotten a bad phone with the first and tried again. Second was in much better condition with an apple brand charger - no scratches or camera issue. Then I found I couldn't mute the shutter sound when taking a photo. After troubleshooting I realized this camera must have been refurbished from another country like Japan where it is illegal to silence the camera noise. Only way to get rid of this is to do some next-level hacking, which is out of my skill range and technically illegal. This foreign refurbishment was NOT disclosed and is also a deal breaker. Returning this phone and will hopefully have no issues..",2

1.0,The phone's reception was terrible and it had a short battery life,"July 2, 2016",Yes,"Disaster.  The phone's reception was terrible and it had a short battery life.  On top of that, the charger broke after a week with the phone saying that it wasn't a certified charger.  The problem with cheap charger is that it kills your battery (or so they say).  So, all those suspicious glowing reviews may not be happy after 6 months...Ok, so after all that I return it and, using my tracking number, I see that they received it.  Then I waited for a refund, but it never came.  I contact them and they said that I have to give them a tracking number in order to get a refund.  That was not a part of the return policy.  At that point I couldn't find my tracking number so I had to beg my post office for copy.  Another waste of 2 hours...The worst part is that this phone isn't even a great deal.  I got a new brand model from Boost mobile for the same price.  If you want one on the Verizon network, then go with a Groupon deal - again, for the same price.  Don't risk a refurbished unless there is a steep discount...Lastly, if you want a free phone, just buy one from these guys and return an empty box.

5.0,"LOVE my ""new"" phone!!!","January 19, 2017",Yes,"I bought this phone from Amazon's Certified Refurbished program. I was a little leery of buying a ""secondhand"" phone, but I have been an Amazon customer for many years, and have always had a great experience. The few times I've ever had a problem with anything I've purchased, (very few times in many years), Amazon has taken great care to correct any issues in a very expedient manner, so I have come to really trust them. I am a Prime Member, I use the Prime Pantry Feature, I buy things off the regular site, etc. So I was more than willing to give the ""Certified Refurbished Phone Program"" a chance. However, I still read EVERY single review from other people who had bought a phone this way. And although there were some less-than-completely-positive reviews, there were far more happy and satisfied customer, than not. So I bought my iPhone 6 (not S) and it arrived 4 days earlier than expected, it looks BRAND NEW, and it is in perfect working order!! I could not be more happy with my phone. I also had great faith that if  wasn't happy, Amazon would make it right. But fortunately, it is everything I was hoping it would be, and more! I was expecting to see some scratches on the glass, and the body, which I was already willing to live with, since the price was so good, plus free Prime shipping. But this phone arrived looking absolutely brand new, with a charger that has a nice long cable. I already had a case for it, and headphones, so I didn't need to buy any other accessories. I couldn't be happier or more impressed with this purchase!",16

5.0,The iPhone 6 was a great iPhone. The increased screen size compared to the ...,"March 14, 2016",No,"The iPhone 6 was a great iPhone. The increased screen size compared to the older iPhone 5s model was certainly a big change that was well worth the wait. The larger phone allows you to view more on your screen and you can do more than you could before. Another big change was the addition of Apple Pay. As of right now, Apple Pay isn't everywhere, but it is expanding and will soon be in more and more places. Apple Pay allows you to pay for items in store, wirelessly, without needing to take out a credit card. This is a great feature that saves time, but as Apple Pay is not everywhere yet, it has not reached it's full potential. Sadly, the camera on the iPhone 6 did not receive a major upgrade, but it certainly is a little better than the iPhone 5s' camera. Overall, the iPhone 6 is a great phone that I would recommend.",0
1.0,Certified?,"March 31, 2018",No,"Apparently certified without original accessories and shipping in a plain box. This is not a refurbished iPhone by apple, but by a third party and that’s not a certification by any means.",0
5.0,... years now and I believe it to be the best design of an iphone yet,"May 23, 2017",No,"I have had my iphone 6 for almost two years now and I believe it to be the best design of an iphone yet. The slick back and smooth screen provide a soft, but sturdy grip. The only problem I have been having is that the phone tends to bend just below the volume buttons after extended periods of being in your pocket. All together, I would highly recommend this phone, although I would buy a case for protection and improved durability.",0

A few minor scratches and dings but it's hidden by the cover I got. So far, the battery life doesn't seem to be the best. I'm doing some research as to how to improve this. The biggest issue I'm having at the moment is the camera makes a shutter sound whether or not the phone is on silent. And it is loud. I'm also trying to tweak this. In all, the phone is good, it's working well so far (this is day 2), but it is not in as good of a condition as I would like considering the price.",0

4.0,Having this iPhone is great! Its pretty light for a very tall phone ...,"January 12, 2016",No,Having this iPhone is great! Its pretty light for a very tall phone and has a pretty decent camera to take pictures with. Apples firmware takes up about 10 gigs of that phone but the rest is yours to use. Since its made from aluminum the phone can get pretty warm-hot playing high pixeled games or anything that shouldn't be running on an iPhone. There is a removable  sim card on the side to the right and has a weird circular ring around the camera lens in the back. Writing this as a honest customer and not someone who has received a discount or is paid to do this.,0

They have conveniently decided they didn’t sell me the phone. Only thing is, is that I haven’t bought any other phone from anyone in over 2 years.

1.0,Highly recommend buying the extended warrantee,"October 15, 2018",Yes,"Phone seemed fine, has a small wave on the side, min scratching, but nothing major at all..However battery is very weak, does not hold a charge (must leave plugged in and even then the battery most of the time does not have enough of a charge to turn on). At first there was no issue with the battery, except it ran down pretty quickly. As the days goes by, the faster it ran down, and the more it wouldnt keep it charge..Bought in the end of June, shipped in early July. Received within the wk I am sure (didnt look to see when received). In just 90 days the battery life dropped very quickly to where most of the time it wont even turn on when plugged in charging..Apple store will not touch said item and the gentleman they see this enough supposedly everyone is informed at it in their stores and told not to touch at all. He claimed the products used inside the phone is not apple approved parts (after market parts). He also claims this is false advertising to claim it is certified refurbished (he did state its more misleading as ppl assume when seeing certified refurbished they believe its apple approved, where it is actually only certified by another company). He further told me most of these phones sold usually have issues right before or after the warrantee, the 90 days..Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with after market products. If the seller notices such as with this case, numerous ppl having major issues with the phones being sold right around the 90 day mark, they should as sellers demand those working on them to pay attention to details, use a different supplier for the after market products or extend their warrantee. This is would be good customer service which in turns brings in more customers...I would not recommend purchasing this at all, but if you want too, purchase the additional coverage. 98% chance you will need it right around the 90 day mark...By the way what is up with sending play dough to some customers? At least make it glittery play dough, or unicorn play dough..........",1

I bought this refurbished phone from Amazon. knowing I could return it if there were any flaws. The phone arrived in perfect condition. It looks brand new, it works fantastic. I’ve had it for a few weeks. My only complaint is the battery will not make it through the day. And I am not on my phone all the time so that is frustrating.  With my android I would usually have 25% at least by the end of the day before plugged it in for the night.  I have changed several settings on my phone trying to extend the battery life. But I’m not sure that it’s a problem with the battery as it is just a problem in general with iPhone.  It says that my battery health is good and operating at 100%. So I don’t think it’s a faulty battery. I keep it in low power mode all the time and constantly close out apps that are open. Other than that, I love this iPhone. I’ve ended up buying a spare portable battery for $10.",0
