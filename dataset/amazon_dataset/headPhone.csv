5.0,Perfect price and quality,"October 8, 2018",Yes,Got these for my 13 year old who listens to music constantly. They are great sound and they block out the annoying sounds from his younger brother so he can enjoy his music. They fold up nice for going in his book ag while at school.,515
2.0,Some Factors to Consider,"October 13, 2017",Yes,"UPDATE: After less than a year of ownership, the structural integrity of these headphones has begun to degrade. The leatherette covering, present on the ear cushions has begun to flake. Cracks have also begun to develop in the headband. These headphones have been used lightly and have been well cared for; these are factors to consider when purchasing these headphones...Original Review: Great Pair of Bluetooth Headphones for the Price: As a certified audio professional who mainly listens to and composes rock music, I can say that at this price point you are not going to get Sennheiser, Bose or Beats audio quality out-of-the-box. However, for the price these are useable headphones that are more than capable of providing decent audio quality (once the right adjustments are made). They require a bit of frequency gain reduction between 60-250Hz to reduce boom and a boost at around 16kHz to establish clarity. Once you’ve done that you’ll have a more balanced sound from these headphones...The bluetooth volume controls, and battery status bar indicators of these headphones are natively supported on Android (but not on macOS.) In other words when you adjust the volume on your headphones it will directly adjust the volume control on your Android device. On the Mac the headphone’s volume is independent of macOS. Play/Pause and Skip buttons work natively on both platforms...There are no latency issues when watching video. Lips move in sync with audio...The MPOW 059 supports the SBC audio codec exclusively, which means no AAC or AptX is present. It would have been great to see support for AAC seeing as it is a superior codec to SBC but nonetheless sound quality is reasonable...macOS users will need to download the “Hardware IO Tools for Xcode” from Apple’s developer page in order to get the “Bluetooth Explorer” application. This application will allow you to increase the bitpool value from its default value of 40 to 53. This will dramatically improve the audio quality of these headphones and any other bluetooth headphones that rely solely on the SBC codec. For those who want specifics: a bit pool value of 53 is equal to a bitrate of 325 kbps. SBC at 325 kbps is the equivalent of MP3 at 256 kbps. When the you’ve downloaded “Hardware IO Tools for Xcode”  and have opened the Bluetooth Explorer app you will see the app’s name in your menubar. Go to “Tools &gt; Audio Options” or “Command + Shift + A”. This will bring up the window for you to edit the SBC audio settings. Under “SBC Codec Options” Set all bitpool values to 53 and close the window. This will ensure that the audio quality remains optimal. Close the window and re-connect your Bluetooth headphones...Build quality seems reasonable, hinges are reinforced with metal. Only time will demonstrate the endurance of these headphones but superficially speaking the headphones appear to be quite sturdy. The ear-cups and headband are made of a soft synthetic leather which provides initial comfort but they are a bit shallow in depth and can place a bit of pressure on the ears when the headset is worn for an extended period of time. Battery life is reasonable. Accessories include a micro-usb cable for charging and a 3.5 mm audio cable which is handy for more critical listening and for events in which the battery has lost its charge. The velvet-like pouch is a great inclusion and provides protection against dust and scratches. These headphones are definitely worth the price and I doubt you’ll find better at this price point.",617
5.0,Wear them Daily,"May 27, 2017",Yes,"Pros: comfortable on my large head. No headphone has ever covered my ears without hard places or sweaty or too tight. These are good for hours.2. Battery seems to last many hours. Lost track.3. Pairs easily with my moto  G 4 phone and also a BT transmitter connected to my Chrome TV dongle.  Easily xfer back and forth.4. Clean, rich sound.  Nice break from my ear buds..5. Build quality acceptable for this price.  Soft earpads and padded cross support.  Buttons gave solid response.  Ear cups are flat enough to lay head on pillow to watch TV..6. Adjustable enough to find perfect comfort position..7. Good volume and surround and noise rejection..Cons: none.  We'll see how they hold up to long daily use..Update 9/30/2017  I wear these for several hours each day.  Holding up well.  Battery still holds good long charge.  I added moleskin to the earpads to make them a little more comfortable.  Ear holes could be a tad bigger for my head and ears.  Overall still the best headphones I have owned.","1,535"
3.0,"Lag when using these to watch shows, average sound","February 5, 2018",Yes,"Amazon reviews used to be helpful; I'm learning to start tempering them with a good dose of skepticism.  Apparently terms like ""fantastic"", ""amazing"", and ""phenomenal"" are used loosely and to cover a wide range of very average products.  First off, FOR THE MONEY these are decent headphones.  They aren't anywhere close to better headphones in sound quality or build quality, but they aren't close to the price either...My first and main issue with them is that there is noticeable lag between the show and the sound through these headphones.  Any lag in sound while watching a show makes them unusable in my opinion.  For music, not a big deal at all of course...Second, the sound through these headphones is very average.  There is no deep bass; I've used much smaller headphones (not over ear, and not earbuds) that have MUCH better low range.  I have a pair of over ear headphones I purchased on Amazon for under $100 that have fantastic (truly fantastic, not fantastic for $35) sound, clarity, and low range.  There is some noticeable fuzz/static while listening to shows, though not enough that it really bothers me...Let's stop giving 5 star, better than my Bose (not a fanboy), glowing reviews to average products.  It doesn't help anyone who needs honest opinions about products...Lastly, mine only came with an audio cable and a USB cable; it did not include a power adapter, which it sounded like it should from the manual when it tells me to insert the charger into a standard outlet...For $35, this is an OK set of headphones.  I wouldn't buy them again if the lag issue during shows is normal.",755
5.0,Mic doesn't work,"March 20, 2017",Yes,"The Mic doesn't work properly. Others can barely hear my voice...Update 04/06/2017:..Customer service did pretty good job and fast, by contacting me about the issue I had. They even re-order a new one for me, now everything is work perfect as I expected. Thank you and keep up the Good work.","1,009"
5.0,Great purchase,"August 31, 2017",Yes,Fantastic head phones! They stay charged FOREVER! I had them fully charged and used them for an hour on average 6 times a week and did not need to charge them again for a month! The only complaints I have is when doing certain exercises they tend to slide off my head a little so I have to adjust them a few times.,533
1.0,Two Failures?,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"I purchased two of these on Aug 18. 2017.  One failed in approximately 90 days and one in 110 days.  Both outside the Amazon return window.  Requested help (or at least sympathy..lol) from the shipper and received none.  I do recognize that the shipper does not warrant the product; however, they normally have a better rapport  with the manufacturer they represent.  The units worked great until they both failed to pair with any of several devices they had been pairing with.  This is the first negative review I can remember giving.",125
5.0,$30 is CHEAP for five stars *glory hands*,"August 30, 2017",Yes,"I waited over a month to write this review because I thought no way could these headphones actually be this good for the price.  But I use them all day everyday and I have never been more impressed with headphones under &gt;$50... I have sensitive ears with headphones and am super picky but these are so comfortable I can sleep in them.  Noise reduction is great when something is playing, pretty crummy though when there's no audio. Fast charge, easy to pair Bluetooth or wire jack, play/pause and fwd/rwd buttons are handy.  Overall definitely worth the buy, highly recommend.",389
5.0,Replacement works great,"August 2, 2017",Yes,I received the item in a timely fashion. I unpacked it and read the user manual. Then I charged it. The red light came on and in a couple of minutes it went out. I thought maybe it had been charged and was still holding the charge. I was able to pair it with my iPad. I listened to two tunes and then a full half hour of a britcom on YouTube. Then the battery was done. I recharged it and had a similar experience. I just returned it for a refund. Be advised that you may or may not get one that works...The company contacted me and said they would like to send me a replacement. I received the replacement and charged it. It took about 3.5 to 4 hours to charge. I then paired it with my iPad. I listened to some of my music about two CDs worth. I then watched about three of my favorite Britcoms on you tube. The audio quality was outstanding. I listened to music or watched you tube tv shows and some music tutorials for the next week and a half. I even had them on for 7.5 hours one day. I planned to wait until they needed charging before i wrote the review. They are still going strong. The fit is good and very comfortable. Now about the sound. I already said that it was outstanding.  I compared them to my Sennheiser cable head set. I honestly could not tell the difference. I then compared them to Bose wireless there was a very slight difference but not much. Overall they are extremely good. If you have trouble with them contact the company and see what they can do. I love them and could not be happier.Ron,70
5.0,Very nice value for bluetooth headphones (foldable / wired AND wireless / good build quality),"January 29, 2017",Yes,"Need a nice value bluetooth headphones with durability, good sound quality, &amp; can be wireless OR wired? This MPOW headphone is it!..*Unit Operational Test*.This is a pretty simple unit to test. I started with testing fitment / adjustment to my head using the sliders (stainless steel sliders, nicely done!) while also testing the ability for folding the headphones (worked great, very solid feeling). The memory foam ear cushions and along the inside of the headphone band where the top of your head will touch feel very comfortable with good spring in the foam. It is an attractive set of headphones, good use of contrast red, silver, and black. The device is touted to NOT be active noise canceling so we'll test passive noise reduction with the over-the-ears cushions...The device has user controls on one side (power, volume up, volume down, track forward, track reverse, play / pause) on the right-ear side. My Test: 1) Turn on the Headphones ... you'll heard a clear voice 'Power On' message. 2) Turn on Bluetooth on your phone and pair the MPOW headphones / connect. 3) Start up your preferred music or audio smartphone app. 4) Operate the headphones (connected and streaming from your BT-enabled phone) for 10 hours continuous streaming and wired mode (using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable) along with conducting a test phone call. Then power off the headphones...I used my primary phone, a new Nexus 6P as my initial test. I turned on the headphones (the headphones provide an initial.""powering on"" along withe a ""not paired"" audio cue), then paired the device and connected by phone using Bluetooth (yet another audio cue ""phone 1 connected""). I next started up one of the music apps. Eureka, it works!. Sound quality is quite good especially at this price (little emphasis in the mid-band imo). I can confirm no active noise cancellation but with the nature of the ear cushions I did experience reduce ambient noise when the headphones were on and in use. Sound can get LOUD but yet clear (no distortion nor crackling), which is nice to see. You won't get thumping base or highs, but that's to be expected...I next disconnected from bluetooth and attempted to test wired connection using the supplied 3.5mm audio cable that was supplied by MPOW to connect to my phone's headphone jack. The MPOW worked well in wired mode! Very handle to have both wired and wireless modes. I lastly powered off the headphones (nice touch for an audio ""powered off"" confirmation cue)...My next test was to make 2 phone calls (one to my home landline phone and one to my cellular voicemail). Calls were very clear and quite loud (with the headphone volume turned all the way up), and everyone could hear me fine using the built-in mic. This test completed successfully as well...*Recharging*.The MPOW Bluetooth Headphones offers built-in rechargable battery (420 mAH) that is rated to last up to 13 hours of continuous music time or 15 hours of talking time. I've done a test with the headphones running while streaming music using bluetooth, my test ended after 10 hours and it was still running! That's more than enough run-time for me...I tested recharging as well using the micro-usb port (found on the same side as the user controls). You'll see a red led light come on.. It took me several hours for a full recharge after using for 10 hours straight in my music playback test...*Build Quality*.Very solidly built device. Not in the same league materials-wise as Bose but also not in the same price range. Good use of sturdy plastics, memory foam as the ear cushion, stainless steel for the adjustable sliders. The unit's folding capability also worked well, very solid feeling along the hinges. Good fit and finish overall...*Conclusion*.This MPOW Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear delivers in what they said this device could do. It connects seamlessly to your BT-enabled phone and can play streamed audio but also can accept a wired connection (no battery charge needed in wired mode!), the headphone design is foldable (great for travel &amp; storage in general). It's a solidly-built and comfortable-to-wear device. Mpow offers a 45-day money back guarantee and a 18-month worry-free guarantee as well (I've not yet needed to take advantage on the other Mpow items I've bought in the past, all are working great). I would happily recommend these headphones to friends and family, especially for the value &amp; flexibility to use in wireless or wired mode..<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Mpow-Bluetooth-Headphones-Over-Ear-Hi-Fi-Stereo-Wireless-Headset-Foldable-Soft-Memory-Protein-Earmuffs-w-Built-in-Mic-and-Wired-Mode-for-PC-Cell-Phones-TV/dp/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headset, Foldable, Soft Memory-Protein Earmuffs, w/ Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/ Cell Phones/ TV</a>",797
4.0,Great Sound for Budget Headphones,"February 24, 2017",No,"I've really enjoyed these MPow Bluetooth Headphones, especially for the price.  At an entry level price, you get good sound and long battery life.  It doesn't have the really deep bass like some other headphones do, but they offer decent balanced sound.  If you wear them for more than an hour, it could start to hurt your ears if you have larger ears.  If you use the bluetooth feature, make sure you either turn your headphones or phone volume all the way up to maximize your volume.  With one turned all the way up then you can control the volume with the other device...They pair really fast with an iPhone 6S Plus and they have audio cues to let you know what mode the headphones are in...Making a call was clear, but having my voice muffled by the over-the-ear style headphones isn't ideal for me, so I probably wouldn't use them for long calls...While they don't have active noise cancellation, they do a good job at keeping background noise out because of the style.",819
5.0,Best Headphones,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R31CWRIH2DAP34""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/E1ss063UMRS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B14N9ASmYeS.png""/> These headphones are perfect!",73
1.0,"no midrange, yes white noise/distortion--don't bother with these unless you like to get stuff in the mail only to return it","May 1, 2018",Yes,"This headphone set has poor sound quality:  it lacks midrange, and attempts to compensate by boosting treble and bass, but in a bad way.  Mids are still scooped &amp; music sounds poor &amp; cheap..The hissing white noise is intolerable, unless you like white noise then these are perfect for your youtube noise videos...I tested these with (remastered) Led Zeppelin, Physical Graffiti, and Hillsong United, Zion.  I would've also tested with Maxim Vengerov or a Rachmaninov concerto but didn't bother after listening to two albums...I'm not an expert but I am a musician with sound engineer experience.",47
5.0,Mom and Teen approved!!,"September 6, 2017",Yes,"Birthday gift for our 19 year old son who keeps either breaking the headphones or they crap out on him after a few months. He LOVES the bluetooth and that they are over the ear.....as do I. They fold up as well, although he hardly ever takes the time to do so during the few hours that he actually doesn't have them on. One of the main reasons I purchased this kind had to do with wanting him not to have them shoved INSIDE his ears for these long periods of time. So...win/win here! They seem to be holding up to him so far which says a lot actually lol..Thank You!!",118
1.0,Let me down,"December 11, 2017",Yes,"These seemed to be solid, awesome headphones but as of today they mysteriously stopped being able to charge and prematurely died on me at work after showing half battery life 10 min prior. Had high hopes for these headphones as my job is very physical, hands on,  up to 12 hour shifts but very disappointed now. Shows no red light indicating charging with multiple chargers on different outlets.",72
2.0,Downgraded: I would've keep buying and using these...  Three times the right/left speakers no longer work correctly.,"June 18, 2018",Yes,"I'm downgrading my review of these headphones...Originally I thought these were great.  They sound, fit, and work as a headset in the greatest I could expect for the price.....BUT..I've seriously kept them folded up and in a case whenever I'm not using 99% of the time!..Three times now, for some reason, only one side works!  When using BlueTooth, only the right side works!  When using the stereo jack/plug, only the left side works!..I'm frustrated because they worked great, then I charged them before folding them and putting them in the case for the night.  On a random morning.....!!!POOF!!!..Only the right side works via BlueTooth.  OR Only the left side works with the wire...Update on comfort, I've worn these almost 24 hours straight while traveling via Greyhound, playing audio the whole time.  That part is still great...Original:.Here are the reasons why I bought these:.1. Bluetooth so I can go both hands and wire free to talk and listen to music..2. Price and audio quality.  Other reviewers indicated the price and quality were great.  I agree!.3. Easy hands-free use.  Being able to adjust the volume and switch tracks without pulling out my phone is great!.4. Headset feature.  I love answering the phone and adjusting the volume without taking the phone out of my pocket or belt holster..5. Comfort.  I wear these up to 6 hours at a time. They don't get very sweaty or cause discomfort wearing glasses..6. Wired option.  I like this because if the battery dies (which it hasn't), I can plug them in using a regular audio cable...They are over the ear and fit really well, even wearing glasses.  With my over the ear hearing aids, they're not as great, but I'll usually take those off just to have these on instead...This silver pair are actually the 3rd set of this brand that I have had.  My original red pair had a problem after about 9 months of use.  (Perhaps a wire shorted out from folding it or wearing it while lying on a fluffy pillow?)  The second set started to buzz when I was using it in Bluetooth mode, and the audio quality of the microphone became faint...This time, instead of exchanging them, they refunded the money.  I immediately ordered this pair!..I really recommend buying the hard travel case for these too.  I have always stored my headphones, folded up nicely in the hard case.",15
4.0,I'm definitely a little confused about these being a best seller because I'm assuming that most of the people ...,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"I think the sound quality on this was okay. I'm definitely a little confused about these being a best seller because I'm assuming that most of the people who bought these couldn't care less about the people around them when they wear these. IE: You will be ""that"" person on a plane/bus/work who's music can be heard within a 5' radius to those around them. I wanted to keep these, but I'll be returning them because there's no way I can wear these at my office without driving my coworkers nuts. The overall look/design was fine (but I'm a 5'7 female with average sized ears and my ears barely fit). The sound quality was honestly average - even for the $30 price range though it could be better (but I didn't play with changing the equalizer on my phone - so it might have been better if I tried)...Update: Changed from 2 star to 4 star (the Mpow059 is still not a 4 star)- but customer service was really good and offered to send me the newest version of these headphones (Mpow H1 Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear Lightweight, Comfortable for Prolonged Wearing, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headphones, Foldable Headset w/Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/Cell Phones Black-Red). These are MUCH better than the Mpow 059 ones. The design is sleeker, and the volume doesn't pollute the way the Mpow059 ones do so I've actually been wearing these in my office. They still aren't completely sound pollution proof but I asked my coworker if she could hear my music when it was at just above mid-volume and she couldn't. The diameter is also slightly bigger so my average ears feel snug but not tight like the Mpow059. I would say if you're reading this, don't get the Mpow059 ones, and instead buy the newest model (Mpow H1), which is the same price. Also, the battery life is really good. I haven't charged this since I've got them last week. I've used them for at least 15-20 hours on throughout the week. In regards to phone calls, these aren't for you to be talking on the phone all day. People had a little trouble hearing me, but I was able to answer my call just fine. If you're looking for something to have phone conversations on, you probably need headphones with an actual mic if you want to stay within this price range.",26
1.0,"Liked originally, but regular, loud distortions and interruptions ruin my listening experience","October 3, 2017",Yes,"*UPDATE* March 2018: 1 star.Initially, I really liked these headphones, but now after using them regularly over the past few months, my opinion has totally changed. (see original review below) For the first few months, they worked great, but now I regularly get these VERY loud interruptions to the audio I am listening to. Intermittently, the speakers will produce a VERY loud distortion sound that I can best describe as a combination of fuzzy static and a loud screech. It is always much much louder than whatever I am listening to which is completely jarring, and honestly quite frightening when listening to something quieter/gentler. (It is so unexpected and loud that it has made me physically jump). This is now happening more and more frequently, now occurring multiple times during a listening session (30min - 2hrs)..This issue can't be caused by wear and tear because I have never even dropped my headphones or subjected them to any physical handing that would cause damage. They are either on my ears, or sitting on my desk...I also know that this issue can't be caused by a specific app or my phone, because it consistently occurs with multiple apps while using the headphones and has never occurred with any other bluetooth (or wired) device I have used with my phone..Overall, I am very disappointed with these, especially since I spent a lot of time shopping around and I thought I had finally found a reliable pair of bluetooth headphones...October 2017 Review: 5 stars.Works well. Great sounds. Easy and fast Bluetooth connection. Only complaint is that it's a bit tight on my ears and they get a little sore after awhile",28
1.0,You Definitely Get What You Pay For.,"August 10, 2018",Yes,"First off I'd like to clarify that I am by no means a audiophile, but have had my fair share of headphones in the past. Personally I don't think you should have to pay your months rent for a pair, but if they're too inexpensive it does raise some flags, that being said I do have a few that definitely breaks the mold that you have to pay more to get more. Which is what brought me to these, the mixture of pages of glowing reviews and even articles written by so called audiophiles, plus the price tag I would have been crazy not to jump on them right? I was beside myself with excitement when they arrived, I was going to be the proud owner of budget Beats! As far as looks go they are very aesthetically pleasing, they look nothing like you paid $34.99  that's great. The booklet stated that they needed to be charged for 4 hours before the first listen, it wasn't very long after I had them hooked up, maybe 2 hours if not that long the charging led shut off. It certainly wasn't the full 4 hours, I thought that was pretty odd but didn't put too much into it, the important thing was the sound.Another little cool feature is these headphones have voice commands never seen that on a pair before, now onto the sound. Putting it simple the sound is garbage, the bass if you can consider it as such is so muddy and muffled it almost sounds like the music is coming out of a hole,  I had to turn my volume up to max and even then the sound was still horrendous. Now after all that I have to really wonder about all these beaming reviews, how many are authentic and how many are fabricated, that seems to be an ongoing issue on Amazon, I have learned if you want a truthful review on a product or an unbiased one that points out the bad as well as the good, look up 4 star and below ratings. If I had done so in the beginning I would have had more insight on the performance and been able to make a better thoughtfull purchase. The only pros to these are the look/design and voice command features, quite a few people were upset over the fact they don't seem to last long and have issues with connection, the fact that they seem not to come to a full. 4 hour charge could have meant trouble down the road as well. In this case you definitely get what you pay for.",16
1.0,Wireless connection to phone lasted two months. Now nothing ...,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"Wireless connection to phone lasted two months.  Now nothing.  Can still use it with a cord, but that's not why I bought cordless headphones.  And after about six weeks, the signal became very spotty, so I didn't even get two months full use out of them...UPDATE:  Replacement sent- just another piece of junk which cuts out constantly and requires the use of the cord attachment, rendering them worthless as a replacement for earbuds.  I can imagine that the whole thing will cut out in a few more weeks, just like the first set.  You get what you pay for, I guess.",41
4.0,"Great When Connected Via 3.5mm Audio Cable, Not So Great Sound With Bluetooth","September 1, 2017",Yes,"I just returned some very overpriced, very defective Sony cans, and I'm happy to say that these far less expensive Mpow headphones have them beat in just about every way so far...They're still new, but they're comfy, they fold up for easy storage while still being adjustable in size, come with a nice bag to sleeve them in, and - most importantly - they sound great.....if you're connecting via the included 3.5mm headphone jack...The one place they fall short is in the same area a lot of Bluetooth headphones do.  Music sounds like garbage when dealing with Bluetooth audio compression, and unfortunately, they don't appear to have any tricks on hand to offset this issue.  The net result is that music sounds thin and hollow when playing over wireless.  The difference is huge between Bluetooth vs. 3.5mm connections...All in all, very happy with the purchase.  Just wish they had more ""oomph"" when playing over Bluetooth.  I'll keep them plugged in instead.",10
4.0,"Good sound, but need some breaking in.","September 20, 2017",Yes,"Nice headphones with good sound, but had to adjust them slightly to fit comfortably...When I first got them, they clamped too tightly on my head (which would be great for exercising, but I wear them for hours at a desk). To stretch them out, I put them around a box for a couple nights (the Amazon box they came in) and now they fit comfortably. I also noticed they are more comfortable for my head if I wear them backward (controls on the left side) so the ear pads don't rest on my jaw. They are heavier than headphones without Bluetooth, so my head will tire faster (but that comes with the territory)..For reference: my head is about average for an adult female...My only other complaint is the buttons are a little loud when I click them while wearing the headphones, but not unbearable...All around happy with this purchase after breaking them in a bit.",11
1.0,"4-Month Old Headphones, Inconsistent Sound in Right Ear","May 2, 2018",Yes,"It's been 4 months since I bought these headphones, and the sound in the right ear has recently started going in and out. I have to maneuver the wiring with tape on the left side in order to KEEP the sound in the right ear. My headphones always go out in one ear eventually, but never THIS quickly...October 2018 EDIT: I was sent another pair for free shortly after posting my initial review, but these too are acting up. If the wire gets moved (whenever I move my head in any direction), it can result in static, the sound coming out in only one ear, or silence. Going to have to purchase a different pair of headphones.",9
2.0,Disappointed with audio quality,"October 9, 2017",Yes,"These are the first Bluetooth over the ear headphones I have purchased so I don't have a basis for comparison with other brands or models. The price was good and the fit was fine for me. Wearing comfort was OK but I haven't worn them for an extended period of time due to my issue with the audio quality (below)...Pairing was simple with  my smartphone. Operation with the buttons took a little getting used to but worked fine. I haven't used them enough to comment on battery life...My major complaint with these headphones is the quality of the sound. The audio was just dull sounding to me. Mids and highs were poor and almost sounded muffled. Bass was only OK. I played the same music with a set of recently purchased MPow Bluetooth earbuds and there was no comparison. The earbuds audio was bright and realistic even though they cost about 1/2 the price of the over the ear headphones...Edit 10/10/2017: My original review should have included the comment that for me the major complaint about the audio quality of these headphones is that vocals are coming through sounding muffled or dull and also seem to be at a lower level than the instrumentals on any track I listen to.

1.0,Battery does not charge,"October 8, 2017",Yes,Worked for a couple of months. Now battery stopped charging. Do not waste your money,13
1.0,They are a waste of money,"February 2, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are cheaply made. The first pair I bought, the button to turn them on and off stopped working within the first week. This time around it has stopped working again, and I have had them for about 2 months so I'm unable to return them. They are a waste of money.",30
4.0,I can focus at work again!,"September 19, 2018",Yes,"My office got the redesign and I was the lucky one to have a cube right off the main highway. Immediately, I knew this would be a distraction to me - both hearing everyone enter and exit the office and then having everyone think they can talk to me. So I wanted an over the ear set of headphones that 1) would cancel/block some of the noise, 2) would let people know I was listening to music, 3) had great sound quality, and 4) didn't break the bank. This set was exactly that - and it came in my favorite color, pink!..This set pairs great with my iPod and my iPhone - even better, I was able to figure out how to pair it with my laptop for those late phone-in meetings. That said, I've found that the bluetooth sound quality in phone calls was not as good as the line in, but I think we all understand that issue...The battery lasts a LONG time - I have never had it quit on me (but then, generally, I plug it in during lunch). I don't hear my coworkers nearly so much, but can still hear my desk phone. And people know now that I'm not just ignoring them because I don't like them, I'm listening to music. If there are negatives, they are 1) that the design causes my hair to get caught and and 2) the discomfort on my ears when I wear really dangly earrings...Overall, this set has been fantastic - I never imagined using them for conference calls, but they've worked great! I'm hoping they last a long long time because I like them very much!",5
5.0,Customer service superb....,"August 26, 2017",Yes,Broke after just four months Poor Mechanical  Design....Okay  they sent me a replacement free of charge... I have no other recourse but to give them 5 stars for customer service....it may have been just a fluke that they broke the first time... thank you Mpow.Buy the way the sound quality is real good...,20
4.0,"Great headphones, just a little tight on my ears","June 27, 2017",Yes,"Overall impression, these are great headphones for the price but, perhaps due to the size of my head, I can't wear them for long..SOUND QUALITY: I'm really impressed with these headphones considering the price range they're in.  The sound is crystal clear and they're great at minimizing sound intrusion.  My neighbors were doing some serious construction the other day and I couldn't hear them with these headphones on.  These don't provide a massive bass experience but what you'll hear is the best I've experienced for headphones under $100..FIT:  For starters, I'm 6'2"" and always have a hard time finding head-related gear (think sunglasses, hats) that fits properly.  I don't know why head stuff is so challenging for me.  Maybe I'm an alien, but these are too tight on my head.  The padding, both on the ears and on the top of the head, is great but I can still only stand wearing them for 15-20 minutes at a time before my ears can't take the pressure anymore...BONUS: I didn't realize from the picture but these fold down to a compact size really nicely.  They'll make for great travel headphones!",17
5.0,VERY impressed,"June 29, 2017",Yes,"This is my first experience with bluetooth wireless headphones and I am impress.  I have nightmares about getting my old bluetooth cell phone to pair with the audio in my 07 Camry, but these paired up to my iPhone 7+ immediately.  I also purchased the DayKit Mini USB Bluetooth CSR 4.0 Dual Mode (a steal at under 7 bucks) and the Mpow headphones paired up with my PC instantly.  The sound quality is decent although it won't blow you away with extremes of volume or bass.  For average listening though, they are more than adequate and they are wicked comfortable to wear.  Take them off every hour or so, so your ears can breathe though. .  The ONLY issue I've had, and it's not the fault of the Mpow people is that when I run iTunes on my  Win10 PC it gets way confused and I have to turn Bluetooth off, exit iTunes, then turn Bluetooth back on and restart iTunes.  Since I have other networked devices in the house, iTunes sees them on the network, but it doesn't show them as an option.  I have to select the ""My  Computer"" to get it to work.  A minor inconvenience, but I blame Apple...Bottom line, if you want a very decent pair of really inexpensive, but quality made Bluetooth headphones, give these a try.",9
5.0,Excellent Headphones for Low Cost Bluetooth Solution.,"June 17, 2017",Yes,"I've probably owned 25 different kinds of headphones over the years -- from cheap, cheap to multiple hundred dollars in cost. Expensive ones have broken; cheap ones have held up for a while.  But I still ended up needing a pair of inexpensive, bluetooth headphones to use when watching TV or listening to music while going to sleep.  These were cheap (about $35) but had good reviews so I decided to try them...What a surprise.  Decent sound quality (I'm older and my hearing isn't what it used to be, but they have reasonably solid bass and the frequency response seems smooth to me).  The sound quality isn't what you'll get from really high grade headphones but the build quality is good and it is, after all, being used with an iPhone playing mp3s.  And it is quite an upgrade from using earbuds...I'm pretty sure I could not have gotten a better value for the money.  They are solid and although I've only had for a couple months, I think they're going to hold up well over time.  Pairing is easy and they don't seem to require recharging too frequently...Anyone who has $40 or $50 expectations should be very pleasantly surprised with both the sound and the build quality on these.",8
5.0,Best bang for the buck!! Get bangin!!!!!,"December 7, 2017",Yes,"Not going to lie... i only bought these to hold me off till Corsair makes a better version of the VOID with TRUE surround sound but it turns out these headphones are freaking amazing!! The price, style, colors and comfort are all a grand slam. The battery on this thing is fantastic and it baby sips on the juice. If i had to be critical of these and i don't want to be but i'd have to say the fact the headphones don't twist forwards like all the rest of the traditional headphones. These do fold into a more smaller and portable size which is great but i don't know... I'm really stretching here guys...Very happy with my purchase, Thank you Mpow. I'll gladly buy another pair from you guys...UPDATE: I realized there is no pictures in the reviews for the blue headphones. Maybe these might help... i guess.",8
3.0,Decent,"July 22, 2017",Yes,"I've had them for a week now and have used them just about everyday, I think I've got a good handle on them. These headphones aren't the worst I've ever used but they definitely aren't the best. I've got a pretty big head and they are able to be adjusted to fit my big dome quite comfortably. They feel like they're decently made. Some headphones that are this style feel like they'll break in half when you put them over your head, luckily these don't feel that flimsy - but I still don't want to toss them around too much...I wear them in 2 situations, 1 in which they perform exceptionally and another where they leave some to be desired. Situation 1 - around the house after work when I listen to podcasts, the perform very well. The voice of the podcasters are clear and rich. The ability to leave my phone stationary charging up and still use headphones is clutch. Situation 2 - at the gym, listening to music. The bass boost in these headphones is too much for my musical interests - mostly metal music. The low end of these headphones tends to muddy the guitars and midrange sounds. If you listen to EDM or something similar they tend to sound better with this style of music. If you listen to heavy metal, I'd pass on these. My last complaint is that these headphones keep my head hot while I'm at the gym because the ear coverings are so large. I'll get so hot that I'll have to take them off and wipe off my disgustingly sweaty head. So there's that...What else is included? There's a carrying bag that's made from a similar material as the Crown Royal bags, if you're familiar with those. There's a micro-USB cable and a 3.5mm audio cable, both about 4 feet long...I included a dollar in my pictures for scale...**UPDATE**..After my review I was contacted by customer support regarding my displeasure with the headphones. They offered 3 potential solutions:.1) send a different set of the same model,.2) a similar model they suggested,.3) or offered to send me a model of my choosing...I know some people like these poofy headphones but they've never impressed me so I went with option 3 and chose the MPOW Cheetah headphones and have been really impressed with them. I'd give them a solid 7/10 on audio quality. There are certainly limitations regarding audio quality when it comes to ear bud style headphones but these definitely play heavy metal in an extremely satisfactory way. Not too bassy, pretty clear highs and mids...I like that I'm able to turn the volume up beyond what my phone suggests because c'mon, there's a reason I can't hear in the first place (listening to my headphones too loud...#cantstopwontstop). The buttons feel solid and have already taken quite a bit of use, because I'm always skipping songs. I think everybody does though, so I'm good there. The only thing that's a little counterintuitive, at least to me, regarding the buttons is that to change to the next song you have to click the volume down button. That just takes some getting used to but is hardly a negative...Like most ear buds, after extended use they start to cause some discomfort in the ear. But that's not a negative as much as it's an indication to rejoin the rest of the world. If anything it's a feature...Overall I've been very impressed with the MPOW Cheetahs, I'd give them 5/5. I stopped using the original headphones entirely, actually. The battery lasts a couple of days before needing to be recharged, though, to be honest I'll usually proactively charge it after 3 or 4 days...It's been a while since I got these so I can't remember if it came with a micro-USB cable or not, I don't seem to have an extra anywhere though. Honestly I'm glad, I've got so many already I'm glad I don't have another. But it is a micro-USB slot...TL:DR Anyway, to wrap this up: I do not recommend the MPOW poofy over ear headphones initially reviewed. I highly recommend the MPOW Cheetahs, though, 5/5.",189
5.0,Truckers Choice for talk and media,"July 28, 2017",Yes,"Truck Driver. I bought these to be able listen to audio books etc. while driving my big rig. Love being able to answer phone at the touch of a button. Pleasant female voice says ""you have an incoming call"" while media is on. Noice cancellation is great. Everyone hears me well through the invisible mike. Comfortable. Well constructed. Loud. And has a cord jack so my wife can quickly use them on her iPhone when she rides along without pairing to blue tooth. Excellent product.",51
2.0,I love these headphones,"November 11, 2017",Yes,"I did really like these headphones originally, the sound quality, the comfortable fit, good strong bluetooth connection, a wired input option, and the apparent noise cancellation.  However the buttons are terrible to deal with.  I can't believe none of the reviews seem to care about this.  The volume and navigation buttons are all on the same flat ring in a circle around the main button and everything is the same level with no tactile bumps or anything to help differentiate.  Also there is a medium press of the main button that activates pairing (with the unit already on) and a long press for powering down.  So every time you shut it off it goes into pairing mode (and announces it) for a second, then it shuts off as long as you keep pressing down.  Seems like that should be the opposite (most devices require a really long press for pairing).  Finally you might easily pinch your fingers in the area where the phones extend from the headband.  Perhaps this is all acceptable at this price point for the sound quality you get.  I'm looking for another pair with tactile buttons so I can quickly and easily make adjustments.",7
5.0,For the price you absolutely cannot best these headphones,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"For the price you absolutely cannot best these headphones. I ordered these for my wife to use during a trip from DFW to SEATAC and nearly didn't give them to her because I liked them so much...Pairing is quick and simple just press and hold the power button and you are good to go...Sound quality will blow you away considering what you paid for these, I've bought many headphones in my life some very expensive and some very cheap, these sound like they should cost about $120 the bass isn't amazing but that'd alright with me...Passive noise cancelation is nothing like active noise cancelation, all these do is isolate you from the outside world and as such anything too high pitched or too low pitched will still make it through. But once the music is playing you won't be able to hear the outside world at all...Battery life has been outstanding so far as well I haven't actually managed to fully kill them yet but they did last from the moment I got through security st the airport to when I stepped into my ride at the other side a good 10 hours later...My only real problem is the fact that instead of just a beep when at full volume it actually has a voice telling you that and it can be a bit annoying.",4
3.0,"mediocre headphones OR an adequate headset, can't be both.","January 24, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are comfortable enough to wear for an hour or two, but not much longer - and though the sound quality leaves *much* to be desired, you get what you pay for where audio gear is concerned. Bluetooth connectivity works with no trouble, and the option of pairing with multiple devices is appreciated. The microphone is sufficient for voice chatting (1ch 16bit 8000hz, aka Telephone Quality)..My main complaint with these headphones is the sound quality change that happens while you're using the mic. While using them as merely headphones, you can get readonably clear (2ch 16bit 44100hz, aka CD Quality) audio playback - the speakers themselves sound awfully tinny and weak, but at least the playback quality is acceptable. However, as soon as you activate the microphone, the quality drops significantly (to 1ch 16bit 8000hz, aka Telephone Quality, to match the microphone.) Imagine that instead of listening to your favorite track on a normal pair of headphones, you're listening to it through your phone speaker, transmitted from your friend who's holding their phone up to their laptop speakers - it's awful...Honestly, you're better off spending more money on better gear, if you have the option - but if you don't, just know that you can either use this set as mediocre headphones, or an adequate headset for voice chat - never both at the same time. If you like to listen to music while your game and wan to still leave your mic active, you should look for a different product.",4
4.0,Great For The Price. Sound Compares Well to Beats Solo2 Wireless and Sony MDRXB650BT/B. Tight fit.,"October 1, 2017",Yes,"I tested these against two other headphones: <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Beats-Solo2-Wireless-On-Ear-Headphone-Silver-Old-Model/dp/B00X6X2EKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beats Solo2 Wireless On-Ear Headphone - Silver (Old Model)</a> and <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Sony-MDRXB650BT-B-Extra-Bass-Bluetooth-Headphones-Black/dp/B01BY7ZMXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony MDRXB650BT/B Extra Bass Bluetooth Headphones, Black</a>. Note; I tested using wired mode, not wireless mode...Sound is pretty good..- Beats Solo2 Wireless had better clarity and a little less bass..- Sony MDRXB650BT/B had much more bass...Comfort is OK but applies too much pressure to allow long periods wearing them..- Beats are lightest and most comfortable of the 3..- Sony are light enough and have a circular rather than oval ear cup, which may be useful for some listeners...Controls are fine. (Sorry, can't remember control comparison between this and the Beats and Sony.)..Mpow usability on calls is mixed. Bluetooth mode had too much breakup. Wired mode worked fine. Watch your voice level, as these over-the-ear headphones could easily make you a loud talker...Bottom line: great for the price.",5
5.0,Love these in office and lawncare setting!,"July 16, 2017",Yes,"Go ahead and buy two pair. Maybe three. I have to share mine with my wife. These are awesome! I bought these and a pair of MPOW Thor. These are much better. I wear them at work in my office job to drown out the distractions, as well as my side job--my lawn care business. They work very well to block out the loud engine noise and create a wonderful listening experience. I often listen to audiobook which are very easy to hear in a loud environment. These headphones have a rich and deep sound for music. As good as Beats, to me. A very long battery cycle is nice. I charge mine maybe once a week if even that. And that's listening for a couple hours at work, then 2-4 in the evenings. They adjust well and fit nicely. They don't feel cheap. To be honest the Thor model feels cheap and doesn't compare. On these, the controls are very nice and easy to use. The range is astonishing. I walk to the printer and forget to take my phone. No loss at all with many people and computers/smartphones/devices between. Mowing, I've left my phone on the mower and walked all the way around the house without loss or even a skip...Sorry for the length, but I want to make sure I cover it all. I have not a single complaint in several months of hard use. Buy them. Buy these over the Thor. Sorry MPOW to bash the Thor but these are far superior. Ordering a few more pairs soon. One to keep at work so I don't have to carry in and out. One for wife, one for uncle. Thanks MPOW for a great product.",6
3.0,Weak bass sound. Ears hurt and get hot.,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"(Be sure to read update had bottom of this initial review.) The only reason I’m not giving one star is because these things were inexpensive, so sometimes you get what you pay for. I regret this purchase. The sound quality is very weak. I can barely hear the bass compared to other headphones I own that are the same price range. I even have some cheap earbuds that are way better sounding with deeper bass. I am disappointed also with how uncomfortable these are. I can only wear them for about 30 minutes and I have to take them off. They push in really hard and feel really tight on my ears. I guess that would be a good thing if you were outside jogging or doing yardwork or something, because they will definitely not come off easily. Otherwise they are just painful after about a half hour. And also the make myvests super HOT. It feels like they’re on fire. So, pain AND hotness  SO uncomfortable. My old Avantree Bluetooth headphones are much more comfortable, eats don’t get hot, and the sound quality is twice as good (especially the bass) — and I paid about the same for them. If I had more time on my hands I would return these for a refund but I don’t. I guess I’m just going to continue listening to my old headphones. Maybe I will keep these as a backup pair but I do not recommend buying these. On the plus side, they do fold up, which most other over the ear Bluetooth headphones do not. So they go in a smaller case. I also bought the case. Other than that, I would not recommend. I guess I can’t hit a homerun with everything I purchase on Amazon. Oh well. Onward and upward. *** UPDATE ***  The name back to her contacted me via email after I posted this initial or review. They sent me a new pair of headphones in the mail, but they are different model altogether. They look even cheaper than my original ones. But the sound quality is a lot better. So kudos to the manufacturer  for doing that. I changed my rating from two stars to three stars on that basis.",5
2.0,Muffled sound,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"Upside is they're fairly comfortable, build quality seems good, and bluetooth paired just fine. You can use them over bluetooth (or 3.5mm) while plugged in to charge, although there's an audible electrical hum from the charger. No need to turn them on/use battery if you plug in 3.5mm...The downside is that sound quality is incredibly poor. (I.e. iPhone earbuds and Panasonic ergofits provide much clearer sound, at the same price or less.) The mids are present, but treble and bass are seriously lacking. Sound is very muffled. I'm honestly not sure if the set I received was defective, or if these are just cheaply made. I'm returning them...Update: Mpow sent me an H2 set to try. These were better, but not great. I ended up purchasing Sony MDR-XB50AP earbuds, which sound much fuller for a few dollars less.",13
5.0,These headphones are perfect. It works amazingly well with my glasses and ...,"September 5, 2017",Yes,These headphones are perfect. It works amazingly well with my glasses and plugs (stretched ear lobes). It does a great job helping me block out all the other people around me when I am at a coffee shop.,9
4.0,Stopped Pairing With Transmitters - Had them Less than A Month! (Update in Review),"November 1, 2017",Yes,"**Update Below**..These headphones are testing my patience. Let me start with the good then I'll talk about the bad...Pros: They're pretty comfortable, they weren't that expensive, they look nice and feel sturdy...Cons: They stop pairing with my bluetooth transmitters. I have 2 different brands of transmitters and for some reason these headphones will pair with one, work for a few hours then boom, it won't pair again. I've tried making sure both headphones and transmitters were fully charged but it's a no-go. The headphones like one-night stands with my transmitters. It will work once or twice then never again. I can't tell you how many times I've tried pairing these with the two transmitters I have and it just doesn't work. Then eventually, I can't even get the headphones to pair at all! It goes from Power On to Power Off...Completely useless if I can't use the wireless option of these headphones. I'm very disappointed...Update: The company sent me a replacement and it's been working great! I'm able to pair it with no issues. The first pair has again began pairing with my computer's blue tooth but still won't pair with my bluetooth transmitters but that's okay since the new pair works fine.",11
4.0,Amazing cans for the price,"January 18, 2018",Yes,"Battery life: A+.Comfort: A+.Sound Quality: B.Pairing Process: A+.Durability: A+.Connectivity:A+..Batterylife:.Holy smokes, this thing will go and go like your typical energizer bunny...Comfort:.I've never found myself wanting to take these off simply because they hurt my ears or head. Very comfortable...Sound Quality:.This is where you get what you pay for. They're your standard cheap can's sound quality. They don't touch Etymotic, Shure, or Klipsh, but they're not awful. I can admire music from nearly every speaker I hear it out of. The average person won't have an issue with the SQL...Pairing Process:.I know this is important to a lot of you. The pairing process was very easy with my iPhone X, and my Macbook Pro 15"" (Late 2016). The caveat here, is how MPow allows two connected devices at the same time. There have been times I've turned these on 50 feet away from my computer, expecting them to pair to my phone, only to have forgotten they were last connected to my computer. Wouldn't you know, these headphones connected to the computer. They stuttered a bit (50 feet was also through concrete walls...), but the connectivity distance is surprising on these. Make sure you only keep one thing paired to them at a time though...Durability:.I list durability because I work in the construction industry, so everything is subject to destruction. These headphones have held up to the tough environment I thrust them through...Connectivity:.I already elaborated on the 50 feet range. Surprisingly strong connectivity.",3
5.0,"Great buy, comfortable and good sound","June 26, 2017",Yes,"Believe I finally found a great set of headphones, at a very good price. They look super nice, quality seem sturdy (well made), and the fit is extreamly comfortable (I have yet to try them out at the gym, and wear them for a longer period of time), not to loose or tight. The sound is perfect for my use, meaning great quality for the gym (for super music enthusiast, I would go with more expensive brand). It would be nice if the volume could go a little higher, you will not get anything loud here, but the sound is good. Paring with both my Samsung S4 phone, and IPad 2 was very easy, as was charging. Walked 10meters away from my phone, and the music was still perfect. The sound is the same quality, wheather Bluetooth or direct cable connect. Next I need to pair it with my LG TV, hopefully that will go as smooth as everything else..All in all, I will recommend these headphones, they fold up easily, very comfortable and good sound, all for about $35.00..UPDATE: I have used the headphones at the gym, and they are truly comfortable, have had them on for 2 hours without a problem, almost forgot I had them on. They do not do noise cancellation, but the sound is good, and they look sharp (got compliments). Still easy to connect and charge.... Love my headphones.",4
2.0,"Nice headphones, died after less than 6 months, customer service was less than ideal","October 30, 2017",Yes,"First, these headphones are great. I bought them for a work trip that had me doing a lot of travel. They're comfortable, they block outside noise well, they fold down nice, the controls are easy to use, they sound good, the battery life is solid. They quickly became a part of my every day. I was using these things all the time and thrilled that they were so nice for such a reasonable price...Then the battery died. I hadn't even had them for 6 months and the battery died. What I should have done here is go through Amazon to deal with this, but I contacted MPow directly. They responded reasonably quickly and asked that I send the headphones back to them. They said they would check them and send back replacements. They even covered my shipping costs. At this point I was entirely satisfied with the process. Things break, parts die, I get it. But this is where it went south.....After an extended wait, I received my replacement headphones. They were all scratched up, the hinges were loose, the ear padding was beat up, the play/pause button looked like someone had taken a thumb tack to it, and the line in jack was all beat up. They looked like hell. On top of that, one end of the line in cable was snapped off. I don't know if they worked, I never tried them. When I contacted MPow about it, they just said to send them back and they would issue a refund. That's fine, but what I wanted was a working pair of headphones. I've now spent several weeks dealing with this, and have a bad taste in my mouth about MPow. It's an acceptable outcome, I guess, but I'm really disappointed at how the whole interaction went...SO. These are really nice headphones. They had become essential gear for my everyday workflow. When they died, MPow basically shrugged. I got my money back, which is nice, but what I wanted was working headphones that hadn't spent three weeks in the bottom of a high schooler's backpack.",3
4.0,Not What I Initially Thought...,"June 4, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE 06/17/2018:.------------.Without even asking me, the amazing team at Patozon sent me a completely free replacement set of this model.  I haven't yet tested its bluetooth capabilities, but I will do so and rework my review to reflect that.  But, for now, I'm going back to 4-stars because I love the Mpow headsets that I have, I get great sound quality from them, and the customer service for Patozon is second to none.  They're the best.  It's worth it...06/06/2018.-----------.I used to rate these at 4 stars, but... While I love and support the Mpow headphones, this set is falling a bit short for me. It's supposed to offer bluetooth support for both my phone and my computer, but it often will only play sound from one, and not the other. If I try to switch back and forth between my phone and my computer, there are definite issues, and I usually have to turn my headphones completely off in order to reset everything to working order...Also, very disappointed that the exterior covering is coming unglued on the headset's crown area, and I have attached images showing the ungluing. Overall, I loved this headset, but it's not as good as I thought it was when I first received them. Downgrading to three stars.",2
1.0,Non-Existant Bass. All High End.,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"5 stars for comfort. 1.5 to 2 stars for sound. My $9 Skullcandy earbuds have better sound than these headphones. The bass is flat. I'm going to probably return these because the sound is garbage. It's all high end. Even with an EQ app on my macbook it's still terrible. Put my little $9 earbuds in and the sound is booming. I bought these because of all of the positive reviews. So I'd have to say if you don't care about bass and you want comfort, then these could be your headphones for sure. However, if you want at least some bass then you'll be better off looking elsewhere...Downgrading this to 1 star because now I found out I have to pay to ship these back to the seller. So I'm out $8 for buying crappy headphones that I can't keep.",30
5.0,I love mine but I'll keep ya updated on how long they last (which might be a while they look and feel durable),"February 17, 2018",Yes,"Mpow is quickly becoming my go-to heat set for everything sound related. My first headset from them was just tiny wireless Bluetooth earbuds and I love them. I bought them about 2 years ago and they are still going strong and the battery still lasts forever which is incredible. Since I needed a new headset for my computer instead of my phone yet again I decided instead of the usual which is usually Turtle Beach and lasts about a year I would check out Mpow's offering...This is the headset I decided to get and I'm not disappointed with my first impressions. Comfortable, acceptable sound quality and they feel sturdy. They can be wired or wireless which is a huge plus for me since 50% of the time the wire breaking down on Turtle Beach is the problem and then the other is Turtle Beach just falls apart because it's cheap plastic. This has METAL in obvious strategic locations so I have a good feeling these are going to last awhile hopefully and if they break, metal is much easier to fix than cheap plastic. Overall perfect fit and I have a relatively big head so size matters here. I think they hit the perfect dimensions to accommodate our different sized cue balls so if Mpow keeps up the great work I doubt I'll buy anything other than Mpow for as long as they keep pushing out great headphones...Cons - a very slightly heavy but you don't notice it after you put them on and think awwwwww yyeeeeaaaahhh thems some comfortable ear cups. Honestly, it's not a big deal and just now I took them off and gave them a few bounces in my hand and they didn't seem heavy but my initial impression was they were a bit weighty so I'm sticking in on here anyway. Sound quality could be better but honestly, they sound epic enough to satisfy me so could be improved but overall what a fantastic headset! Great job Mpow love the name love their headsets more!..On a side note if you get these head over to youtube a google ""Falcon Heavy Sounds"" you won't be disappointed! *if you like rockets, sonic booms, and Tesla Roadsters in space.",3
3.0,not bad. But certainly not great,"November 4, 2017",Yes,"Just charged these up and paired with my headphones.  First impression: not bad.  But certainly not great.  Fit seems decent, but then again I've only had them on for 15 minutes so far.  Sound seems muffled, especially at low volume.  Keeping phone volume high and lowering volume on headphone seems a little better than the other way around.  Also seems better when I remind myself I only paid $34 for these, and my primary use will be for workouts at the gym or on my bike trainer.  If you're after good music quality, spend more $.  If your primary use will be listening to the music you love, spend a LOT more $$.  These will spend a lot of time banging around in my gym bag and just generally being abused.  For my intended use these should work well..Update - 3 days later:  Muffed sound continues to bother me.  These sound better at higher volumes, but I like to listen quietly.  Not a great experience with these.  i think they're going to go back.",3
3.0,Doesn’t keep sound in / UPDATE,"April 1, 2018",Yes,"Below is my earlier review which I still stand by, but the seller sent me a different set of headphones by Mpow free of charge which were way better, and that says a lot about them! The other headphones are called the H2, and although they don’t look as cool as the 059, they perform better and do a much better job of keeping sound in.  Thank you so much for sending them out!  They helped me have 2 great flights to and from my vacation!..——————————-.ORIGINAL REVIEW..I rated these headphones a 3/5 but I’m returning them. They look nice right out the box, nice and shiny but definitely smudges with no effort. You can touch the glossy finish with a dry knuckle and still leave a mark.  They’re comfortable on my big head and funny ears. Bluetooth connection was fairly easy. It was in sync with all the media displaying on my phone which is something I often worry about when dealing with bluetooth. These worked just fine. The sound quality was decent for the price, yes the bass isn’t the best like many other reviewers have said. No big deal I guess, it wasn’t terrible. I bet you’re wondering why I’m returning them. Well, my girlfriend came home while I was testing them out, and I asked her what she thinks. She instantly said she doesn’t like them, she can loudly hear everything I’m listening to while they’re on my head!  I said “No way!”.  I let her put them on and she was right. I could hear what she was listening to clearly. I could make out the lyrics and everything. Even if she turned down the volume to 50% it’s still sounds pretty loud and clear to me. I don’t travel much, but I have a trip in a couple weeks and I bought these for my plane ride. I would definitely be disturbing everyone around me if I’m on the plane listening to the tasteless low-class music I like to listen to sometimes. I’m surprised so much sound is able to escape like that because I even asked my girlfriend to yell at me while I had them on and I could barely hear her. So... they do a good job of keeping outside sound out, but a bad job of keeping inside sound in, and that’s a deal breaker for me. They’ll give me no privacy. I hope this helps.  I wish someone else mentioned this in their review when I was reading them.  Maybe they don’t even know the headphones do this.",2
5.0,"Very nice, comfortable, and good sound.","July 10, 2017",Yes,"Pros:.I love the fact that it's Bluetooth and wired so you can use it with older systems too..Battery lasts a solid 8 hours at work with continuous play..Over the ear fits nicely and is very comfortable..The headband isn't snug or too tight like many are..Sound is very good over Bluetooth from my phone..You can control the volume and answer calls via the buttons built into the headphones...Cons:.I had a bit of a hard time getting the Bluetooth to connect but once paired they work very well..There is no tactile feature on the buttons so it's hard to feel if you are on the volume button or the on/off button.  It would be nice to have the buttons contoured in some manner to allow you to control without having to look...As a 20 year member of Amazon I rely on independent reviews when shopping and I will always try to be as honest and impartial as I can and will try to provide helpful insight into the product.

2.0,If you have a smaller head you may want to keep looking.,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"I read a ton of reviews before buying this product and I was super excited to love them and use them daily. However, I ran into a bit of a snag....First, all of the things I love about the Mpow 059:. - They sync with my devices very quickly. (quicker than my $300 headphones). - I love that they talk to me and tell me what commands I have given. (e.g. Push the power button and it will tell you ""powering on"" or if your headphones are already on it says ""pairing"" ""phone one paired""). - I love that I can feel the volume  and track forward and back buttons easily. - I love the ear padding, it feels good on your ears as opposed to the cheap snap-crackle-pop you get with some of the other ear covers out there...Now for where things went wrong for me.. - The reviews I read mentioned a long charging cord one even showed a 4 ft cord in the review video. My charging chord was a little over a foot and a half. Not a huge deal but certainly not helpful when I want to charge my headphones while wearing them in bed.. - The biggest challenge with these headphones was size. I had the headphones set at the smallest setting and there was no tension to keep them on my ears so the band across the top of the earphones put a painful amount of pressure on the top of my head. I wore them for a couple of days, adjusting the band on top of my head forward or back to try and alleviate the pain but no luck..I love so much about these headphones, I wish they worked for me but I just can't take head pain...I hesitate sending them back, I'm not sure I want to deal with the hassle so I may just donate them to some lucky person (with a larger head)..Just be warned, if you have a smaller head you may want to keep looking. Insert sad face here.",18
5.0,Very nice headphones!,"April 26, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are quite nice.  They fit well and operate as stated.  I purchased them to operate with my 55 series Samsung TV.  The 55 series will not sync directly to the headphones (the 64 series will) so I purchased a Bluetooth adaptor which synced with the headphones easily.  These headphones support two Bluetooth devices allowing me to sync my iPhone as a secondary device.  I couldn't be happier with the outcome and yes, I would recommend to friends and family.",6
5.0,love them so far,"May 1, 2017",Yes,"I've only had these for an afternoon but I already love them. I have a large head and certain headphones pressing into my ears or scalp cause migraines. So far, these have felt very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. I was able to easily pair them with my Nexus 5. I'm still figuring out how to pair them with my Asus Chromebook. They are circumaural (cover the ear completely) and build quality seems good for the price.  I bought these to replace a pair of wireless sennheiser RD160s that stopped working. I will update this review if these give me trouble after I get more use out of them but I am already impressed with them, given the price.",13
5.0,Juuuuuuuust Right !!,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"What I love about these headphones: (skip down a bit for audio quality review)..*Included 3.5 mm audio cable, usb cable, protective soft cloth bag...*Price. For $35 you have a lot of options in the Bluetooth headphone market. This seems to be the sweet spot for ""Budget"" but not garbage headphones. I originally bought the ultra cheap monoprice 8323 and these blow them away in every way...*Fit/Comfort: I set out to purchase the cheapest but not garbage circumaural headphones I could find. I prefer the over the entire ear fit when I am listening to music or podcasts alone or playing PUBG on my phone for long sessions. So comfort is a must. The ear pads are nice and cushy. No digging or jabbing plastic anywhere. The top pad(not sure what it is called) isn't something I've even noticed or given any thought, which is a testament to its effectiveness. It just feels nice and cozy when I wear these cans. I have a rather large head and I haven't once felt like these clamp down too tight. But I don't think that they would be too big for anyone with a less than average circumference head. MPOW somehow nailed the springy-ness here without excluding anyone...Quality/Durability:.I was very surprised to find metal hinges on the foldable parts of the unit. This is a huge plus for a part that will see lots of use.  The majority of the headphones are that cheap(ish) feeling piano black gloss plastic that is a fingerprint magnet. But tough enough that I don't worry about accidentally marring the finish or breaking something with light responsible use. I would not throw these in a backpack every day and expect them to last forever. But I will keep them on my desk or nightstand in my home every day and expect them to last as long as can be reasonably expected..//on a whim I took out my precision torx set and tested every single screw I could find, and they were all torqued down perfectly. no sloppy fastening here!! big plus...Styling:.I really really really dislike anything that looks remotely like those silly beats headphones, and that is what initially steered me away from all of MPOW's offerings. however, I am pleased with the look of the Black/Grey option I selected and as I only ever wear these at home I really don't care how they look. All that being said they are really growing on me. I don't feel foolish wearing them and I like that they are stealthy enough to sit on my cluttered desk and not pop out like a sore thumb making me look like I'm trying to appear younger than I am...Tech stuffs:.Pairing was simple and instant. If I have bluetooth on my phone and I turn on the power to these headphones it instantly syncs and just works, every time. No issues here...SOUND!: (disclaimer. I am not an audio expert or audiophile. so my terminology and standards will differ from yours.).S9+, via bluetooth, using google play music, with the EQ set to normal and Dolby Atmos turned on, these headphones sound as good or better as any earbud, IEMs or headphone(wired or bluetooth) that I have owned. Leagues above all the commercial cheap junk (think skullcandy or even lesser quality gas station audio gear)..Parov Stelar .flac sounds vibrant warm and full. no tinny sounds. no muddy sounds. just a wonderfully enveloping aural experience. everything sounds just as I know it should based on hearing it on many different platforms...Tool -Vicarious Clean, punchy, clear. no missing sounds. can detect every note and instrument. vocals seemed slightly less clear than with other headphones. meh. no biggie here...Lemon Jelly - Nice Weather for Ducks. (if you are EVER feeling down, play this song. you can thank me later. It is impossible not to smile and be full of love after listening to this sweet tune. ).Lovely bright and warm. After listening to this I feel like I might want to adjust the eq slightly for these cans. But that is in no way a slight against them..They reproduced every second of this song beautifully. the only critique might be that at full volume the bass is a bit much for my liking, but that seems to be with any pair of sub-audiophile headphones these days, as that's what people want...Harder Better Faster Stronger (Daft Punk Remix) This is my go to for testing bass as it is punchy but not drawn out or overly used..These headphones are perfect for this song. Get all that punchy bass and still here all the highs nice and crisp with plenty of separation(nothing sounds too mushed together). Maybe just a touch too much on the low end. But that's just my personal preference...Bonobo Black Sands(Full Album).O.M.G. yup. I love these headphones. Sold. Great sound. Perfectly happy. Thank you...What I don't like:..Included usb cable is too short...Silly voice when using functions of buttons or powering on/off. I don't need a femanine robot voice to tell me i just turned on my headphones. lights and beeps are fine. lets not pretend were in the 50s still and we want all future tech to talk to us. (I think all the alexas/bixby/ok google/etc are just as silly. so this is just a personal gripe.)..plastic faux metal styling bits in various places. In my experience this stuff is usually the first to fail, whether its the fake metal paint flaking off, or just dulling or looking worn, I generally dislike this type of styling choice as it really is just pretending to be something its not...If you made it this far. thanks for putting up with my silly pretentious un-educated descriptions. You probably know by now whether or not you want these headphones. If you are in the market for budget headphones with solid quality and your sole purpose in life isn't booty shattering bass, then you can safely purchase these without regret...If you found this review helpful please let me know, or have any question or comment feel free to reach out to me.",1
3.0,A cheap sound for a cheap price,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"Let me start by saying I’m a total audiophile. I purchased these for my 9yr old son who’s pretty hard on most anything...I decided to purchase these base on the reviews here on amazon...Out of the box the build quality is decent, I’m not sure how long they will hold up but their built better than other cheap brands on amazon. The headphone came with a charge and powered up with no issue. When it came to pairing they paired quickly and had no issues. The headphones have control on the right ear piece and all function properly. They can with a audio cable, charging cable and a storage bag I find that nice like high end brands I personally use...Now the sound. These are low powered speakers. Sound is lackluster at best. They sound fairly mono tone. No crisp highs, no full deeps lows and their not very loud. With that they serve their purpose and work well for my son, where sound quality isn’t as important as the coolness of Bluetooth headphones.",2
3.0,Great sound and quality...just not a comfortable fit for me,"October 10, 2018",Yes,"These are great headphones...the sound quality is excellent, the battery capacity is incredible- lasting days on a single charge, but after initially being pleased with the comfort and fit they became extremely heavy after using them for a short duration. I didn’t leave them on for an extended period and I’d wear them for an hour or two and then take a rest from use for at least as long... and they still hurt and wearing them led to headaches. I’m petite but I don’t think that is a factor... I think the issue is in the plastic band that runs along the top of the head. The band is not flat but has an edge (like a C or L shape) and the comfort memory foam type cushion is located beneath that with the vinyl covering wrapping that edge so that edge coupled with the weight makes the cushion nonexistent. I had an indentation from that ridge on my scalp that took 2 days to go away and was headachy all the while. I tried wrapping extra cushion but then the cups were off. So while I can’t wear them as intended, moving around while working on projects, I have found them beneficial after pairing them with my tv which allows me to watch without worry of keeping others up... if I’m laying down so the weight isn’t pulling down on the top of my head, then they are perfectly comfortable. I should say I’ve never been a fan of headbands or sunglasses so I’m not accustomed to a band across my scalp so I might be more sensitive than others- I’m not sure, but these are not for you if band comfort is a concern. Totally happy with the electronic function and sound but these aren’t a fit for me due to comfort. I have the MPOW flame as well and those are great but i was looking to increase playing time and avoid the band under the chin or across the back of the neck, as that is a bit of a hassle if your working up a sweat and they will get pulled out of one ear when the band gets stuck. I have total confidence in the electronic and sound quality of this brand, which is telling because I’ve run through quite a few brands trying to find headphones with decent sound quality that hold up to high activity while wearing and these have been the only ones that have survived that test so now I just need to find the model that’s my comfort fit.",2
4.0,I'm happy so far...,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"So far they work pretty well and they are decently comfortable.  There was a few instances (3 +/- times) on the first night I used them that the sound of the TV show I was watching went to full static (painful!).  I paused the TV show and started it again and the static was gone.  It only happened that night and I have used them maybe 4 or 5 more times since then.  Maybe it was interference from something nearby, I don't know...but so far, there has not been a repeat..This is my first ever pair of Bluetooth headphones and probably only my second pair of over-the-ear headphones so I can't really compare the quality to anything else.  I will say that the seller Patozon seems to want to provide good customer service...they have already emailed me twice asking if all is OK and providing some tips.  I believe I also saw them reply to some reviews to assist people who have issues.  Would I buy another pair of Mpow headphones and would I buy again from Patozon...as of right now, YES.  If the headphones turn out to be lemons and blow out my eardrums or something, I will definitely update this review.",3
5.0,Awesome set of cans!,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE #1.13 months after purchase, the headband cracked. Mpow had a replacement to me within the week, free of charge. I can't say enough good things about their customer service or their product. They have a lifetime customer in me...************..I love these headphones. The ear cups are super comfortable! No active noise cancelling; but with the over the ear model, it wasn't needed. I wear them everywhere! Doing yardwork, in the office to tune out loud colleagues, plane trips to block out sound, and everywhere in between. Couldn't ask for a better set! The only downside is I only ordered one pair for me. The kids can't wait for me to walk in the door from work. I would like to think it's cause they're excited to see me, but they just want to steal my headphones.",2
3.0,Very Average Headphones,"July 9, 2018",Yes,"Overall, they are ok. Nothing to phone home about. If I could do it all over again I would have dished out more money for better quality headphones. The reviews on here can't all be real. BTW, I only use these headphones for music while working out and have had them for about 3 days. So let's start with the basics:..Pros:.1. Cool design and easy to use the controls.2. Easy to pair with iPhone.3. Little to no skipping around when I walk away from my phone w/ the music still playing.4. Foldable headphones makes it easy to put into the carrying case and put into gym bag.5. Stays in place well during workout.6. Volume can get pretty loud..Cons:.1. There is NO BASS. WHATSOEVER. If you want bass....look for another product. I wish I would have listened to the reviews that emphasized this..2. Not the most comfortable headphones ever. I have a pretty big fro, small ears, although not the smallest head in the world, but I still can't extend the headphones out. The ear pads push into my jaw joint quite often so I am readjusting quite a bit during my workouts..3. Sound leaks terribly. I like my music loud, but I don't want everyone to hear what I'm listening to (nothing bad, but I listen to pretty vulgar rap music on leg days *Kanye Shrug*). Someone next to to you can definitely hear what you are listening to unless it's on a lower volume..4. Chewing gum while wearing these irritated the crap out of my TMJ (thanks to the earpads digging into my jaw joint)...Overall. They are very, very average. I will probably use these until I can't stand it anymore...and then dish out big bucks for a better headphone and brand. I really wanted to like these though.",2
5.0,"Great sound quality, loud, clear bass, and comfortable","September 14, 2018",Yes,"These other reviews are not kidding when they say the sound on these are impressive! They sound slightly better than my $150 Beats. The build quality is okay, not the best but good enough for the $40 range. The ear cups are very comfortable and go around my ears. That's important because I have large ears, a big head, and wear eyeglasses so I often have issues with most over or on ear headphones. These are bulky as you might expect but not too large. They look even better in person than the photos. I got the green and black ones and the green is bright without looking like a kids toy. The weight is slightly more heavy than I'd want, but considering how well they fit and comfortable they are (I've worn then for hrs now) it's a fair trade off. Also they can be very loud. I usually have my volume at 75 or max but these are so good that I only need to put them at 50% and they are plenty loud. Can't hear my kids sitting next to me at all and they tell me I'm yelling! 😁 One con is that they do bleed noise if you have them at 50% or higher. Not an issue for the listener, but good to note in case you plan to use these in the bedroom or office. People around you can't really hear them if they're 40% or less though so it's no big deal for me. I started to buy on or over ear headphones after noticing hearing loss after years of earbuds so having a device that does not require me to put it above 50% volume is pretty great. I just hope they hold up to daily use and abuse on my commute. They do fold up to a nice small size and comes with a handy travel pouch.",1
5.0,"After a month, no complaints","October 29, 2017",Yes,"For the price, these are great. After over a week of around 1.5 hrs a day of gym/run time at near max volume, the headphones still hold a little over half of their charge. Pairing was a breeze, all buttons work just fine, and sound is pretty clear. Bass is great, treble is a little too sharp for rock/metal but that can be remedied through on a music player app. Will update in a couple months...Update 1, a month later: I just experienced my first low battery beeps after over a month of the initial charge. I can’t really compare to higher end dre beats or bose, but the battery longevity for the price is outstanding.",4
5.0,Easy to set up the connection between my phone and ...,"October 20, 2017",Yes,"Can't beat these for the price. Easy to set up the connection between my phone and these headphones and now they connect automatically every time I turn the headphones on. I like that there are buttons on the side of the headphone to play/pause, skip songs and adjust the volume. The buttons are a bit hard to feel at first since they're smooth but once you get used to the placement you can find the button you are looking for pretty easily. The headphones are comfortable for about 1.5 hours and after that they can make my ears hurt because they press down on them. I don't mind this because I only wear these on the train when I'm commuting and so I wear them for about an hour maximum at a time. If you are looking for headphones to wear all day these may not be for you because they can get uncomfortable after a length of time...The sound quality is good and noise does leak if you play your music super loudly. But if you listen to it at a medium level the people around you should not be able to hear your music. I like that it comes with a cord to plug in if your headphones run out of battery. The battery lasts a long time. I get my full 15 hours worth of battery life out of my headphones before i have to charge them. I charge them about once a week. Overall, if you are not willing to spend a lot of money on headphones and just looking for something to do the job, these are a great choice.",2
4.0,Very Nice Product!,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"So far very good!  I connect this headset unit using the Bluetooth capability to a TROND BT-DUO Wireless Transmitter &amp; Receiver (both sold here on Amazon for a reasonable price but not as a package deal - individually).  The TROND BT Transmitter is connected to my VIZIO 32"" Smart HD TV through the TV's RCA audio out connections.  The audio is superb through this headset!  There's no latency or hesitation in lip sync transmissions, something I cannot stand to see/hear!..I tried several other transmitter/headset combinations purchased at Walmart but they all had either latency problems AND/OR there was background static/frying sound in the headset.  There's NO background noises in this TV application.  The headset is very comfortable to wear and is quite appealing to the eye &lt;big grin&gt;.  I recommend this combination to anyone else who is planning to add BT to their TV.",3
5.0,Nice Headphones For Nursing Home Resident - Blocked Roommate's LOUD TV,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"My mother with advanced MS was living in a nursing facility.  Her roommate was a very sweet lady who was very hard-of-hearing, and played her TV at nearly top volume.  These headphones replaced in-ear type earbuds and some cheaper over-ear headphones.  My mom's ears were medium to large, and these fit over her ears without squashing them.  They also worked really well to muffle her roommate's TV, so she could hear her own TV or her audio Bible on her Kindle.  They did not cause a buildup of earwax like the in-ear type of buds, and they did not make the cartilage of my mom's ears sore like the smaller over-ear headphones.  Due to her disability, Mom had a TV stand attached to the foot of her bed, and we used the wired option for both the TV and Kindle.  I did test the Bluetooth with my iPhone and it worked fine, but I cannot comment on constant use and battery life for Bluetooth.  My mom has since passed away, and I have kept these for my own use.  I actually like them better than my Monster noise canceling over-ear headphones.  Their sound is similar to my smaller Klipsch over-ear headphones.  I am not an audio expert, but my impression is that the sound in these and my Klipsch headphones is ""crisper"" than the sound from my Monsters.  I really love my Klipsch headphones, but they put pressure on the cartilage of my ears (I inherited Mom's ears!), so I can only wear them for an hour or so.  Thes Mpows are comfortable for an extended time due to the size and padding of the earcups and the padding on the head strap.",2
5.0,"Stop shopping around, these are the ones you want.","August 25, 2018",Yes,"Outstanding headphones for a steal at $39.99. I own 3 different pair of wireless bluetooth headphones and these are by far my favorite. I bought these as an additional pair just to use at night in my bedroom. Kudos to the Amazon Firestick for having bluetooth capabilities as I got these specifically to avoid keeping my wife awake while I routinely stay up sfter she's sleeping watching one thing or another. They paired with no issues at all and have never dropped their connection. They are smart in the way of managing the battery life as I frequently just take them off and lay them on my night table without worrying about shutting them off. They have literally never run dead on me and I've gone days without charging them. When I do charge them I've never had an issue with one micro usb cable or another not charging them well... some devices dont charge well if you don't use the supplied cable - these don't seem to care at all what cord I use. They sound great and fit comfortably. The range is good as well... sometimes I'll get up to use the bathroom and they have never cut out. Sometimes I'll go downstairs and make a sandwich - still good to go at probably around 40-50 feet. Ive even stepped outside to the back deck for a smoke and occasionally it will start to cut out at that point... that's pretty understandable in my opinion. When that happens i just press the middle button on the left ear and it pauses whatever im watching...My only negative is that sometimes I want to turn the volume very low. While using these the TV volume has no effect on the headphones, you only volume up or down using the buttons on the left ear. My only complaint is that the lowest they go before going to mute could be lower. It goes from moderately low to mute with one additiinal click. Thats pretty negligible to me when considering the overall capabilities of these headphones...If youre looking for a great set for an even greater price, look no further.",1
5.0,"Almost perfect, and fabulous for the price","August 28, 2017",Yes,"Very nice headphones.  They fit my average-sized head very well.  They feel snug, almost like they could be too snug, but they remain comfortable for several hours.  The look and build quality are nice.  It's all plastic except for a few key parts, but they have a sturdy feel and I find them fairly stylish.  Controls are intuitive, with a typical 4-way circular rocker with a center button--up and down for volume and right and left for track is easy to remember...I almost took off one star for sound quality, but decided I was being too harsh.  Compared to a $300 pair of headphones, they are a bit lacking, with a sound that is not as crisp and punchy as I would like.  But compared to most under $50 headphones, they are outstanding.  The bass is sufficient and never overbearing and the mids and highs are pretty well balanced and open sounding, just not as 100% fresh as I would wish for.  That said, I think they sound better than a $120 pair of Sony Bluetooth phones I tried recently and returned...Overall, these are a great value and a very satisfactory product.",3
4.0,Superior Quality,"May 17, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are actually a little bit better than I thought when I decided to buy a pair. I wanted better quality in terms of hearing audio, but I'm not exactly someone who listens to music with devices all the time. This seemed to be the best choice, and I do think it's worth it. In terms of audio, it does sound crisp and clear...but at the same time can rock-out if you want to hear it full volume. The only real problem is one of the good features that it has, if you like to wear headphones for a long period of time it will feel slightly uncomfortable over the ears. But that gives superior sound, almost to the point where you could tune-out others around you.",57
5.0,So far so good!,"July 20, 2017",Yes,Ok so I bought the patterned FX-Victoria for $27 and then yesterday I got these Mpow for $37. As you can see the Mpow are a little larger and cover the entire adult ear. The sound is better on the Mpow (because it covers entire ear) and the material feels sturdier. Now the FX-Victoria I've had for months and they work great and have no regrets. I'll use the Mpow some more and update later if necessary. But for adults I'd get the Mpow and for kids the FX-VICTORIA.,5
5.0,Hear Me Out - Try These.,"December 11, 2017",Yes,"I can't say much more than what has been said already in regard to these phones. This headset is a winner. I use it almost exclusively while watching movies on my Amazon Fire. I have had no issues with Bluetooth connection. Because of the nice fit over the ears, most exterior sounds are blocked out...I had to laugh at one reviewer's complaint that the headset ""jiggled"" while he ran. This set is no more designed for running than a pair of iron-tipped work boots...And an additional feature which is very handy: If the battery wears out in the middle of whatever you are doing, you can plug these right into your system and keep on going. A cable is provided with the head set. This feature has kept me going several times...The prices I see for ""name-brand"" headphones are just ridiculous.  Don't spend you hard-earned money for a name on the product. Keep about $270 in your pocket and purchase these for about $30...I've never heard of Mpow before...but I know what sounds good to me. I recommend this item - highly.",2
5.0,Great headphones,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"These replaced headphones that were four years old and the technology has improved greatly in that time. It takes less than three seconds for the headphones to connect to my PC, phone or table. The design of the controls is excellent...There is one thing to caution you about with these phones: the sound is bright. If you love Klipsch and B&amp;W stereo speakers (and I do), you'll love these headphones. My wife is more of a fan of Bose speakers, and she prefers to dampen the sound on her phone or tablet when she uses them. (We actually have two pairs: pink for her, silver for me.)..I endorse these phone 100%. My beautiful wife grades them at 92%.",3
5.0,Better than the price,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"Got these for around 36$ on black friday in 2017 and they still work perfectly. I was worried they'd give out after a few months but they're going strong and I haven't had an issue...Really soft ear padding that only has a little visual wear...The material is plastic and does come off a little like a toy, but it doesn't feel weak and mine hasn't scratched or snapped anywhere...The button for skipping/pausing/volume works intuitively...The noise cancelling is good but not great...The bluetooth can be spotty when you're outside, or when you're at home and get farther than 20 feet from the device. It connects easily to everything but my computer which is probably my failure more than its. You can have multiple things connected with it via bluetooth at the same time however swapping between them is hit and miss...Includes a double-ended connector cord for when the battery is dead or you want to plug it into something for reasons...Comes with a soft velour-feeling bag for carrying that I never use...They fold up and are stretched/shrunk simply and without any issue...The battery life lasts me days without a recharge. The recharge is 4 or so hours. The charger plug-in port is also the really common size I don't know the name of, it's the kind used with the PS4 controller cords opposite the usb end. I haven't actually opened the bag with my charger because I just use the one for my phone...The inside of band that presses against the top of your head is soft, but can still make the spot sore if you can't find a good fit, which I do have a problem with now and then despite being it adjustable. Only maybe one day a month and I couldn't tell you why...The sound quality is good and the volume is separate from the volume of the device it's connected with so you can mess around with both to find your ideal volume...The mike isn't great for calls compared to some other 20$ or so over ear headphones I've had. There's an issue with my voice not being picked up so I'll talk louder than I'm used to (though I'm a quiet speak) or adjust the side with the mike a bit. It works but I usually ask if they can hear me first because I don't trust it.",1
3.0,Worth the purchase if you have a small head,"October 27, 2017",Yes,"Not very exceptional audio, but still very good for the price. Pairing it with a device may take a few tries, but nothing frustrating.  I wish there was a way to adjust the treble and bass to more my liking because higher bass causes some minor static. However my biggest problem is the headband which is hard plastic isn't more wider or flexible because it's a really tight fit. I can't wear it more than 20 or 30 minutes before the pressure builds on my lower ear lobs and jaw that I have to take it off.  While the memory-protein ear cushion seems like a comfortable upgrade over the traditional foam cushions, it remains to be seen whether they will last without falling apart within 2 or 3 years like the foams ones always does. Overall, considering the quality, value and if you have a small to average head size, it's worth the purchase.",3
5.0,"GREAT SERVICE - Replacement Works Great - ""Pause"" feature not working // Too much sound leaks out","March 23, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE:  The company monitored Amazon and sent me a replacement, They work GREAT! Good purchase, good customer service!..I did quite a bit of research trying to find a decent over-the-ear budget bluetooth headphone. I settled on the Mpow 059. I purchased the silver model, and they arrived in two days with Amazon Prime shipping...I really wanted to like these headphones. They looked good out of the box, fit nicely on my head, and seemed pretty comfortable. The one issue I noted right away was how much sound leaked out of the headphones. I wanted to use them in an office environment, but to be honest, even at modest sound levels, the sound that leaked out would likely bother those sitting close to me. At the very least, even if they weren't bothered, they'd know what I was listening to.  That was strike one...The other issue I discovered was that there was no way to ""pause"" the music, which I would need to do when a co-worker approached, or to talk to others in the office.  The instructions say there is a ""Pause"" feature, and there even seems to be an icon to ""pause"" on the headset controls, but no matter what I tried I could not get the music to pause. So, I either had to turn the volumn all the way down, or turn off the headset, if I wanted to talk to a co-worker. Neither of these was an accepable option for me. So, being defective, I will be returning them.  Time to find a second choice for a good, budget, headphone.",2
2.0,COOL,"July 22, 2018",Yes,"I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!!!! I searched and searched for pink and black wireless Bluetooth headphones until I came across these. The ONLY negative thing I didn't like which after reading the manual twice I figured out was these headphones allow up to two devices to be connected at once which is great, but the second device pairs first before the first one ( they're listed as two different names in the pairing area. And that kinda through me through a loop because I know a device was paired but I still couldn't hear anything until I went back and read the instructions again. So just look for the Mpow connection and that's when you'll know your first device is connected. Everything after that is GREAT! Really great sound quality, durable, stores well because they're foldable, keeps a really good charge, and of course duh they're PINK &amp; BLACK!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎..UPDATE: Since buying this the top of the cushion is tearing apart! I've only had these a few months! Also it's hard to answer a call from the pause/play button like it's advertised, but it will end the call. Lastly, there's sometimes weird static noise while on a call that can become very distracting and ANNOYING!!!",1
4.0,"Perfect set of cheap blue-tooth headphones, that won't make you cry if you lose them.","March 1, 2018",Yes,"I have Bose QC 25's for use when I am traveling and have more control about where I lay my things down.  However, when just walking into the park and going to the gym, I'm not comfortable taking the Bose headsets.  1) They can easily be misplaced, and 2) if you lay them down in such a hectic environment, they can easily be stolen...So I need some cheap headphones to use so I could listen to my music, while cycling (not doing any of that weight lifting stuff).  I purchased Jabra 100-980 Smart Wireless earbuds to solve the problem.  They work great, but unfortunately too much movement and the buds fall out of your ear, period!  So I use the earbuds to replace my car stereo, which is broken.  They let me hear music, but let in a lot of outside noise, so I can still hear the traffic and surroundings...Back to the Mpow's.  Well, they met the objective of having headphone that would stay put when I'm cycling or just walking in the park.  They do isolate enough, that I would NOT use these while driving.  Warning!  But for other things, they provide a really good sound.  No, not Bose like clarity, but if you have something with good mid-range and bass, they things will rock you...Two bad things, but, you can live with them.  Well, their microphone for making calls is weak, so folks will tell you to speak up and it has an echo sound.  Also, the ear cups, while soft, they do get irritating with pressure against your head after awhile.  So I have to periodically remove them for a few seconds.  They are also not comfortable just hanging around your neck, when you are not listening to them, either.  So only if I am using the, do I actually have them on my head.",1
2.0,"Below average, but good if you don't care about sound","August 3, 2018",Yes,"Bought this while it was on sale mainly because of all the great reviews and praise for being like, if not better than the Beats products but 100x cheaper. Honestly, the build quality is nice but that is it. I tried these headphones on music and can only compare them to cheap headphones. They sound as if you are listening to music through a can. All midrange, and very shallow. No low end bass and the highs are muffled. So who ever said they are comparable to Beats, they are not. But if you just want some big over ear bluetooth headphones and don't care about the audio quality, they are good for the price. The noise reduction they offer are due to your ear being enclosed by the ear foam. And just to be clear, Beats headsets are not great either, but at least they have a full sound range even if the bass is excessive and boomy. But if you had a good set like a Harmon Kardon Flat set and want a replacement, look elsewhere. You will be disappointed...Update 8/16: my initial review of these headphones have not changed. However, the sellers are amazing and care about the quality of their product. I have nothing bad to say about their customer support. They provided me with a ""better"" quality headphone because of my dissastisfaction. They sent over the Mpow H2. My review of the H2 are similar to the review above. The physical quality is decent though look and few a little less sturdy than the 059 and are more on-ear headset rather over ear. I like that they are not as loud and flashy in design as the 059. But that is just personal preference...In terms of audio quality, they suffer from the same over amplified midrange. The bass response is a little better than the 059, but still feels like you are hearing everything though a can. The sound can only be compared with cheap headphones. Once again, not a set of headphones i would choose if i cared about how my music sound. The H2 feels a little more defined because of the bass response, but the highs are shallow and barely audible. The mid range is extremely shallow with no clarity, and remains the loudest frequency band over everything else. I would still suggest Beats even if i think they are terrible headphones, but at least they have a balanced range of sound...I am not their target audience/buyer. So unless they improve their sound to maybe get close to a Bose over ear headphone, i would not buy as a replacement. But i guess its fine if you just want a wireless headset that you can really beat up and not feel bad because at the price point, its replaceable. My score remains at 2 star...But 5 stars to customer support.",1
2.0,Comfortable fit and balanced audio; Bluetooth sounds underwater,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"Update: So it has been just over two weeks since I received these, and the Bluetooth quality was initially excellent, but now sounds like music is underwater. I checked to see if maybe charging would help, but after charging fully, the quality is still painful. The quality doesn't suffer when using the adapter cord, though, so no idea what is happening there. But since I purchased these with the main intent of online communication for my school work, and the microphone only works in Bluetooth mode, these aren't working as intended...A huge disappointment, since they started off so phenomenally!..Note: I just got these in the mail, so I've only used these as wired headphones...Right off the bat, I LOVE these! To do a test on how well they are, I put on the soundtrack for The Greatest Showman. Anyone who has listened to it knows that there are some huge imbalances in the audio on a few tracks. But with these headphones? NO!!! I don't need to be changing the volume to hear everything without rupturing my eardrums on the louder parts of the songs!! YESSS!!!! I'm honestly astonished at how well balanced the audio is. I hope the wireless capabilities are just as wonderful!..These are definitely over the ear headphones for me, and feel very comfortable on my head and ears, even with small hoop earrings in. These definitely give a great first impression, even though they don't come with their own charging base.",1
4.0,this is one of the most comfortable head phones I've used,"July 29, 2017",Yes,"In general, this is one of the most comfortable head phones I've used, and the folding capabilities make it nicer to transport than a lot of other options.  Coupled with the good battery life, and the awesome backup physical cord for those non-Bluetooth-enabled devices, I have an overall positive impression of these, particularly for the price point...I have noticed one minor con:  I occasionally notice an audio glitch while using them.  I suspect this might be due to the fact that I have these paired with multiple devices, and there's usually at least two in range at any given time.  I have been, perhaps, a wee bit too lazy to unpair those other devices to test that theory, so don't put too much stock in that.  Your experience may differ...UPDATE:  I have verified that the audio glitches are indeed caused by having more than one device connected at a time.  It can be quite maddening at times.  These are fantastic headphones if you are using it with a single device.  Be wary with multiple devices, particularly if the devices automatically connect.",2
4.0,"Great quality, but not good for long term wear.","May 23, 2018",Yes,"The sound and connectivity of these headphones are great, but I can't wear them for long periods of time...I have very loud children and there is only so much time I care to spend telling them over and over to quiet down (their favorite thing to do is to jump as loud as possible directly above my office...where their room is...and shake the ceiling above my head, giving me anxiety attacks).  Wouldn't you know it, I don't even have to turn the volume up all the way to completely tune them out.  They get to have fun and I get to not be the miserable parent who does nothing but scream at her children for simply being children.  Unfortunately, I can't wear them on my head too long because they are a snug fit and eventually give me a headache.  I did much better when I first wore them, lasting a few hours at a time, but now I can't wear them but 30-60 minutes before I have to take them off.  It's too bad because I was really happy with them at first.  Maybe they just need to be broken in by resting on top of something a little bit wider than my head for a few days...The last set of wireless headphones I had had to connect to a base that transmitted the signal.  The base was connected to my computer and that's how they worked.  I had to turn off the sound on my speakers or sound would emanate from both places, defeating the purpose of wearing headphones.  Their range was crap and even when I was sitting directly in front of the base, they would crackle like a bad connection on a radio station.  This was long before Bluetooth and given how poorly those performed and their high cost (at least $80-$100) I wasn't sure what to expect with these.  If not for my head feeling squished so quickly, these would be a five star product, easily.",1
5.0,Need additional equipment to use with PS4,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"First I want to express that yhese cannot be used by itself with PS4. PS4 does not support Bluetooth audio devices. I read other reviews and even asked in the questions if it could be used and was told yes. This answer is misleading...By itself the headset cannot be used for ps4. If you get a Bluetooth transmitter to plug into the usb slot on the ps4 then you can use this headset... As for the headset,  it's a wonderful sleek headset.  It's very small and compact. When folded it takes up very little space. A charging cable,  aux cable and felt drawstring storage bag are included with it.  I would highly reccommend upgrading to the hardshell case made for this headset if you want good protection...The sound is quite good on these and the over the ear muffs are very comfortable. It charged very quickly and is shooter easy to pair to a device. These have some of the best sound out of all the headsets I've owned and at the price it's a true bargain. The sleek design gets rid of the clunky headset feeling and they're so comfortable I actually forget that I'm wearing them. When no sound is playing there is a audible background static like noise when they're turned on,  but it's not much of an issue if you're going to be playing music or watching something.  Highly reccommend these for purple who want a compact and sleek headset that delivers in sound quality and comfort.",1
3.0,Good and bad...,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these headphones at the beginning of October and absolutely loved them.  They sound awesome and they're pretty good at blocking out background noise. The bluetooth connection has been a little iffy since I got them so I have just went to using the aux cable cord when this happens.  Used the bluetooth just fine for the last couple of days with no issues until I decided to charge it this morning since it was not connecting or reacting to pushing buttons.  The red light did not come on (will turn on when charging) and the side where you plug it in to charge got really hot.  Trying to find any kind of online support from MPOW is impossible and now my 'wireless' headphones are back to being plain old plug-in headphones.  They still sound awesome, but now I have to buy a longer aux cord so I can do work at my computer without having to sit so close to the screen.  Time to find a different pair of wireless headphones. :-/",2
2.0,May have to fiddle with it,"October 9, 2017",Yes,"Update Feb, 2018 - Despite trying for months I have been unable to get these to work with my desktop. The product support team though responsive was ultimately unhelpful. They even sent me another component to try to pair with. All in all, though the headphones are good my overall experience was dissatisfying and these are now just lying around because the return window closed long back. Reducing another star due to the whole bad experience..--------------------------------.I ordered these last week alongwith a Bluetooth dongle for my desktop. Getting the mic to work on applications like Discord, Skype etc has been a pain. Ultimately figured out I had to have the headphones paired (and turned ON) before the desktop booted. For some reason, the mic doesn't work and picks up garbled junk if I pair it later on. Not sure why and no idea if it is the fault of the headphones or the dongle but FWIW the overall experience wasn't smooth",2
5.0,"AWESOME headphones for under $40. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Good Sound, Good Quality, SUPERB VALUE.","May 19, 2017",Yes,"Update. 9 months in. I LIVE IN THESE. #radheadphones. ... These are AWESOME for $35. They sound OK. They initially sounded a little flat, but I don't really care about sound quality. These have nice 40mm drivers, they sound decent, people can hear me good when I'm on the phone (with no wind). They work very well on my phone, and on my laptop I have a top. Find your bluetooth driver on your computer, go to power management, and disable to setting ""Allow windows to turn off the device to save power"". These headphones connect to my computer almost immediatly after power on, same with the phone. They are comfy, keep my ears warm in Seattle, they look nice. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend them over a $300 pair of beats. Buy these for your friends.",48
4.0,"Good sound and comfortable, but annoyingly loud Bluetooth voice","January 28, 2018",Yes,"Great sounding comfortable headphones at a great price. Fit over ears nicely. Good bass tones..My only big complaint is I don't like the voice that talks telling you when the headphones are ""pairing"" or ""disconnected"" or ""power off"" - the voice is really loud and you can't adjust the volume, I find it to be very intrusive and abrasively loud in an otherwise quiet setting when I am using the headphones. Wish I could turn off this feature and just have an led blink to tell me I am connected or whatever.",3
4.0,Pretty decent for commuting.,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"For what they cost, these do a pretty good job. The sound quality is fine but not great (these are by no stretch of the imagination Bose headphones!), and they occasionally cut out for a moment here and there when on bluetooth mode. I use them for commuting on public transportation, and it's really nice not to have to deal with tangling cords with my bag, etc.. I also use them occasionally at my desk at work, and was worried about sound carrying over as some folks have mentioned, but I asked my officemates and no one could hear anything. I think as long as the cup is well fitted around your ear, no sound should come out. They're definitely large and in charge, but I prefer over-ear to on-ear, so that's what you get. They've held a charge amazingly well so far--I've used them off and on for over a month now and haven't yet had to charge them after their initial charge. The buttons are a little cheap feeling, and the voice confirmation of settings (power on, power off, etc.) drive me nuts, but overall they're decent enough and do the job.",10
2.0,Good sound and Comfortable but a Pain to Use,"December 5, 2017",Yes,"First, the good things about this headset.  It is very comfortable, I can wear it all day.  This is excellent for a noisy cube environment.  When it's setup properly the stereo headphones sound great.  The headset seems to work fine when you get it working.  The batteries do last all day, I've not had them run out on me yet and I leave the headset on all day while at work and plug it in to charge it up overnight when I leave for the day.  It's also great to be wireless!..Now the negatives that are causing me to give this a 2 star review.  I have this connected to my windows 10 computer via bluetooth.  For some reason when you pair the headset to your computer it shows up as 2 devices, the stereo headphones and a hands free headset.  When one is activated the other doesn't work so when I want to use these to talk on my Jabber soft phone I have to go and change settings that effectively shut off the headphone features and enable the headset.  For some apps I have to go into the headset properties in Windows 10 and turn on ""listen to this device"" to get it so windows will hear the microphone.  The problem with this is it disables the headphones and I cannot listen to music while that option is enabled unless i listen through the ""hands free headset"" device which sounds horrible for music (mono and just doesn't sound good).  Maybe this is a windows issue, but USB headsets don't have all these configuration complications...I've been able to make it work but it's a pain, and continues to be a pain switching between hands free and headphone mode.",1
5.0,Maybe can't use them in a quiet office - otherwise GREAT BUY!,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"I only have one negative thing to say about this product. They leak a lot of sound, so if you work in a quiet office and want to play music loudly through these headphones, other people will be able to hear it. This is not the case with more expensive (*much* more expensive) headphones...The voice prompts that tell you what you're doing (""Power on"", ""Phone 1 connected"", ""Phone 2 connected"" etc.) are really nice, but can be different in the power-off sequence depending on which devices are connected. This is a *tad* confusing, and sometimes, depending on what devices are connected, the power-off sequence doesn't end with the typical, very useful ""Power Off"" voice output...Other than that, these earn every bit of 5 stars for the price. As others say, the battery life is very good. It re-connects instantly with my phone and quickly after that with my laptop every time I turn the headphones on. Moving from wired headphones to these has been a really nice move. These have been totally worth the $35...There are lots of thoughtful conveniences to these headphones: comes with a wire for wired listening; folding design; has its own volume switch, allowing you to bump up volumes when necessary; connects to multiple devices simultaneously...The sound quality isn't incredible but it is good enough. I will say this: if the sound quality is bad enough on whatever device I'm listening, I do not enjoy listening to music. These are plenty good enough quality to be enjoyable (for me).",1
4.0,"Review Edited, Read Update.","March 1, 2018",Yes,"Read some good review so i got myself a pair since i like wireless things best. The sound im disapointed with, it sounds muffled. I listened to some music with these and then compared it to just my standard apple headphones that come with iphone. the difference was immediately noticeable. It is muffled, the sound is quieter, and overal just does not sound good. The mic is also not good according to my fiance. He only tends to complain about the quality of the call when i use these, compared to my old apple earbuds. I wouldnt know since i cant hear myself but since he complains even when i dont tell him im using them i assume it is infact the headphones. The headphones also tend to tell me they are at “max volume” but then i look at my device and i can CLEARLY see there is much more volume to go. Very disappointing. Will not order again...UPDATE 3/15..I received a new pair of headphones from the company an no charge since i was not really satisfied as mentioned above, and personally i still dont like them but my fiance and his friend really like them. Im probably just picky with headphones, and that is not really the headphones fault so i went ahead and changed my review from 2 stars. At least my fiance now has some nice headphones for him to use that he really likes!",1
5.0,"Unbeatable sound, comfort, and ease of use for the price. Best headphone deal on Amazon.","September 15, 2017",Yes,"Lets cut to the chase...Q. How do they sound?.A. Excellent! In truth, they have very little character of their own, which is a good thing, a VERY good thing. The bass is not as extended as some much more expensive phones, but what's there is clean and not boomy as some have reported. What really impresses me is their ability to portray depth, which isn't easy for a sealed design. There is no upper midrange ""clarity bump,"" zippy highs or serious resonances. They compare very well with my much more expensive wireless Sennheisers in fact...I bought these for hearing protection while mowing the lawn, but their comfort, great sound and ease of use makes me think I'll be using them for indoor use, commuting and dogwalking as well.  In short, these cans are a superb deal. I have already recommended them to a few friends and will be buying more as Christmas presents. I love these cans!",2
4.0,Good set of headphones!,"January 23, 2018",Yes,"Update 3/8/18..For my initial review, I've rated these headphones 2/5. But now I'm updating my review and rating to 4/5 and heres why. I was contacted by Patozon company and they were concerned about my issues and wanted to make it a better experience for me. They sent over the new headphone replacement without extra cost. They arrived quickly then anticipated. Right out the box the replacements looked a lot better then the first pair. The build quality was nice and the hinges seemed to be better then the first pair. As for the fit, I wear glasses all the time. But I was still able to get a nice seal around the ears and block the noises around me. As for the sound quality, they still struggle just a bit. But with my iPhone, I'm able to change the settings for the music and get something more desirable. Another great feature I like, is the battery status. on the iPhone, it displays how much charge is left on the headset. Not every headphones offer that feature. Overall this was a better headset then I thought. I also have to commend Patozon for their great customer service. They were patient and helpful and solved my issues swiftly...Thank you,..Old review:.They are a mediocre pair of headphones. They do the simple job of playing music.  The build quality is rather decent. But just like every other headphones, the area that should concern is the hinges. Not sure how they'll hold during time. For the price you get something just ok, just don't expect those high end features here.",1
5.0,Good headphones especially for the price.,"September 28, 2017",Yes,"I had the older style before. Bluetooth on these is way better then the old pair you can actually walk 20-30 feet from the device even with a wall I'm between, where the old model had trouble if I put my phone in my pocket. Sound is similar to the old pair it's pretty good but not amazing sounding. I like the headphone controls they are more intuitive then most I have seen, although you do hear it pretty loudly when you click a button with the headphones on. One con that I noticed is that if you use these while working out your ears will get pretty sweaty. Update. I've had these over a year now, and I am really impressed with these headphones. I actually changed it from 4 to 5 stars, I stand by everything I said before, and if I were to add anything I would say they aren't very noise isolating, but overall I have been very satisfied with their performance and battery life.",3
2.0,Good deal,"June 21, 2017",Yes,"**Pros:.Very comfortable. I love the over ear design as opposed to the on ears I had before...1 charge lasts awhile...Price is reasonable for the quality...Sound is nice and I appreciate that the seller spelled out in the description that these weren't noise canceling headphones...*cons-.None for now.**update 9/30/18- after a bit over a year of gentle use (about an hour a day while I walk so no jarring activity. Never been dropped or stored improperly either.) I went to turn these on and they randomly stopped working completely. They were fully charged and suffered no trauma. Just dead. I liked them a lot while they lasted but for the price I really expected longer life...*Other info-.The manual controls on this unit (on the outer right side) are a power/connect button with phone and play/pause options in the middle, with volume controls on top and bottom, and a skip back and forward on each side. It's fairly simple in setup and I find it easy to use as the consumer.",2
4.0,awesome price for everything i need!,"May 17, 2017",Yes,"terrific price for a very comfortable set of solid headphones. the foam pads stay on my bald head while i'm at the gym. the sound is full from all sources, both corded and wireless. honestly, i've yet to have a need to turn them all the way up. the battery life is better than expected, as well. i can go a couple days with then connected to my phone or ipad without a low battery warning...only two things made me deduct from the five star rating, and they're both easy fixes: 1. the 3.5mm cord that was provided with the unit is only 3 feet long, max. get a new cord if you need these to be wired. 2. if connected to two devices simultaneously, you MAY hear static if one device is playing but the other makes a sound. solution: connect only to the device you'd like to use. if i could give 4.5, i'd definitely do so.",4
5.0,Great for hard of hearing,"March 6, 2018",Yes,"We have a unique situation where my brother, who has Down syndrome is very hard of hearing- and refuses to wear his hearing aid. He is also autistic, and spends a great deal of time in his room watching one game show after another. I doubt he could hear much, and I'm certain he missed out on half-if not all the voices..Sooooo...I found these headphones on Amazon, and they had a great rating. Bought a blue tooth thingy to connect them to the TV..I saw my brother smile for the first time in forever. He was able, even with his hearing loss, to hear the TV. Even if he goes down the hall to another room, the voice from the TV carries..I would have spent 1000$ for these headphones that have made such a difference in the quality of his life..They are so comfortable! The clarity is outstanding. The range is waaaaay more than I would have thought possible..I would recommend these for anyone hearing impaired- the difference between silence and being able to interact with sounds from TV, or radio would make a huge difference for the hearing impaired.",1
5.0,Worth every penny and more.,"August 25, 2018",Yes,"Use it at the gym. Drowns out their crappy cycle of current top 10 music. I can hear only what I want. Pairs easily with my kindle fire. Paid about $35 and can't imagine why people spend hundreds of dollars for something that might be a tad better. $200 better?  I think not.  Not sure what the sweat will eventually do to the earpads, but I limit usage to about 45 minutes and take them off a few times to towel dry the pads. Heck. At $35 I can re-up on this multiple times every couple of years.....pay for monthly Amazon Unlimited Music and have $$$ left over instead of paying big $$$ to put more money in a multi-millionaires  bank account. Buy this. Awesome deal. Bought it during Prime week so it might be a little more now....not sure. Beats the heck out of those intrusive inner ear buds that are double or more of the price and very uncomfortable for me. I'm all in with these.",1
5.0,I'm absolutely satisfied with these headphones,"November 23, 2017",Yes,"I'm absolutely satisfied with these headphones, especially wireless for such a low price point...Sound quality is much better than my last similarly priced wired headphones, I'm not an expert in sound quality but personally I don't find flaws at all..Microphone is amazing! I'm not even sure where it's located, but sound quality is great over skype...so it's really 10/10 considering the price point...there's two minor issues, that hardly worth mentioning:..- There's an option to connect to 2 devices simultaneously but it's not working well if you listening to music on your phone and browsing internet on your connected desktop AT THE SAME TIME. In other words if you listen to one device with another one occasionally activating.. well sound quality will noticeably drop when both devices playing sounds...- If you don't listen to constant stream of sounds for a while they have activation delay maybe half a second or so. It's a very specific issue that not everyone will notice. Gamers, music listeners, movie watchers won't notice it. But if you doing exercises at khan academy, that ""completed"" sound will play with delay each time, unless you listen to some music also...But like I said these issues are minor and hardly worth mentioning.",1
5.0,"Great battery and sound, cheaper quality build.","September 12, 2018",Yes,"I am sending these back do to a defect in the ear piece, the stitching is coming out, one is gone and the next one is on its way.  The sound was good and the battery life is unbelievable. The quality in material is ok, the ear pieces and padding on the top where they sit on your head being the highest, the buttons felt a bit loose and cheap. They came with a bag to carry them which was nice...I contacted customer service and sent pictures they request promptly but they hadn't responded, possibly do to time differences, so I decided to save the hassle and return since I was within 30 days of purchase. I decided to go with an ANC set from a different manufacture. If seller had been more prompt I probably would of tried another pair...Added another 2 stars for over the top customer service. I have received another pair of headphones even though I hadn't requested them. Amazon had also issued my refund. They are not quite on par with the $150 set of Sony I bought locally, but these MPOW 059 are really worth buying at this price.",1
4.0,"OK, but low max volume.","August 29, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are just OK in my opinion. They are built real well and set up was a breeze. The sound quality is good but the problem I have is the volume level is really low even when turned to max volume. I used to have RF headphones connected to my TV but was getting interference from my Wi-Fi router so I wanted to try Bluetooth. I am getting no interference and no pairing problems either. If the volume was a little louder, these would be 5 stars. I will keep using these until I find a better option...Edit: I was contacted by the seller after reading my concerns with the volume level and they sent me a different model to try. The volume level on the new model was better. With the great customer service I am increasing my review to 4 stars. The replacement headphones were the MPOW H2 [Upgrade] Headphones and they are louder.",1
2.0,"Yes, these are good, cheap headphones but there are problems with the mic","August 22, 2017",Yes,"If used purely as wireless headphones I think these are probably a great deal...This device completely fails as a headset.  For some reason, whenever the mic is switched on, sound no longer comes out of the headphones channel.  While making calls, this means both the mic and audio devices must be set to ""HEADSET"" not ""HEADPHONES.""  During calls this means:.1) god-awful audio quality.2) you will not be able to hear audio out of any other program running, i.e. you will not be able to use these headsets to game with a friend unless you have another pair of speakers...People also complained about the audio quality of the mic.  This is probably just due to the seemingly limited bandwidth between the bluetooth receiver and the headphones.  I can tell you that call quality on my other pair of bluetooth headphones is about 10x better due to the limitation outlined above...Tested on Windows 10...I'll be returning these and buying something else.  Maybe try Avantree.",2
4.0,So so..,"November 18, 2017",Yes,"Comfortable, sound pretty good. Match my computer chair. the optional plug in or bluetooth feature is nice! Future updates later...Update: 01/07/2018 The headsets are ok..Nothing stellar. Bluetooth is problematic to connect with from time to time, cuts in and out. No 33 foot range as stated. The sound quality is ok..nothing stellar..Update: 03/06/2018  Just noticed you cant plug them in and utilize the corded feature to listen and charge the headsets at the same time. Also while pulled in there is a hissing sound in the background. Will be looking for another headset as the bluetooth has now began to cut in and out enough to be annoying, as the computer is right in front of me. But on the other hand they look really good.",2
2.0,Needs an auto-off or sleep option,"September 4, 2017",Yes,"Pros:.-Very comfortable.-Great price.-Stylish.-Great clear sound.-Strong battery life..Cons:.-Claims to be better than ANC but they aren't at all..The biggest con for me is that there is no sleep or auto-off option. I wanted to use these at night in bed to listen to my white noise app thru Bluetooth from my cell phone. What I found out quickly is that because they never turn off, my morning alarm came on thru the headphones that I had thrown off to the floor the night before. So frustrating!",3
5.0,"059 is a Stylish headphone, but MPOW H1 is more suitable for me.","December 14, 2017",Yes,"Pros: Looks beautiful. Sound quality is OK. Connection is easy and fast. Battery life is long...Cons: Too tight. Not recommended for long-time wearing...---------------------------------------------------------update Jan 3, 2018 (below)-----------------------------------------------------------..The customer service team offered me a chance to try MPOW H1, after knowing that I'm unhappy with 059, which is really sweet..And I have to say MPOW H1 is really fantastic! I love this product...1. MPOW H1 has a more natural sound. This is only a personal taste though. If you prefer more bass, maybe you should choose 059..2. H1 is lighter and more comfortable. It has more flexibility than 059, which makes it more adjustable for people with a bigger head (like me)..To me, these are crucial improvements compared with 059. Now I can enjoy wearing it all day long~..Highly recommend H1.",2
3.0,"Great, but falling apart 8 months later","August 22, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my son this past Christmas and really liked the sound quality, enough so that I was going to purchase a pair for myself. Suddenly the vinyl that covers the padding started coming apart. It is not looking fixable. I’m super disappointed, otherwise I’d give them 5 stars.",4
2.0,Muddy Wireless Sound,"August 30, 2018",Yes,"Since my biggest complaint is going to be about the sound, allow me to say this: I don't understand why it's a problem, but the Bluetooth audio sounds muddled and of mediocre quality.  This is puzzling because when I plugged it in to my LG V30 with a wired connection, I could get high quality audio through the quad DAC that sounded nearly as good as my wired studio monitor headphnes that cost over a hundred dollars more.  That sound quality is pretty fantastic for a headphone in this price range in my experience, but I didn't buy this because it was a good wired device, I bought it for the wireless capabilities, and there, it seems to lag considerably in quality.  I've used ten dollar sets with crisper sound.  I'm not comparing this to high-end Bluetooth numbers, or even phones with aptX or AAC.  Until recently, my go-to was a pair of 18 dollar, behind the head headphones which had better sound quality.  This is a major problem for me...Otherwise?  This is a decent set of headphones.  The build feels pretty sturdy and I'm not worried I'm going to break them, the wired sound is impressive, and the battery life seems at least standard.  It's hard to completely judge, though, as I find the wireless sound unsatisfying enough that I've not listened for long periods...My other major complaint is with the on-ear controls.  I like the ability of wireless headphones to control music right from the set or bud, as it allows me to stick my phone in my pocket and just leave it there.  This set has a ring that makes it difficult to press only the button you want.  The ring is flush enough with the rest of the device that  have difficulty finding it with lightly guitar-calloused fingers, while other sets are not so much of a problem here.  If there is any raised or indented pattern to tell which button you're hitting, it's also too fine to be detected through what are some fairly mild callouses...All things considered, I can't recommend these headphones, but they're not the worst I've ever used.  The wired functionality does mean I don't have to take out my more expensive headphones for decent over-the-ear sound.  It just means I have to sacrifice quality audio, which is already at a premium in wireless sound.",0
5.0,Trouble free Blue Tooth link up. Very comfortable.,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Surprisingly comfortable with surprisingly good sound quality. Compact and ergonomic, easily adjust to your head. Every thing you need is included except a dongle for blue tooth enabling (bought separately). Also easy to use with the audio and USB charging cables included. Note the cables are a bit short so if planning to use as a hardwired item, you'll want longer cables, especially for audio. Audio cable is about 4 foot long which limits distance from the audio device. Controls are nicely built into the ear piece (muff) and control on/off, volume and blue tooth link mode. A clear voice lets you know when you turn them on or off as well as let's you know if your blue tooth link is good. Right now we're using these with a desktop PC, Windows 10. Windows recognized the blue tooth connection immediately and set up the link without having to use any extra software or downloading any drivers. A fantastic value, I'd buy them again.",1
4.0,Overall a B+ easily!!!! read review for details....,"August 15, 2018",Yes,"Very happy overall. The sound is superior co sideri g the cost and while some are comparing them to 99.99+ Bose headphones there's NO WAY these sound (believe me, I've extensively compared them and have no idea how they reached this conclusion, but they do sound great. After a few hours they kinda hurt my top of head so I literally put a folded washrag underneath them to pad the top a little more but it's not bad but much more comfortable. The padding in the top isn't superior but pretty good but you'll want to do the same probably or remove them for 10 mins every hour or two maybe. The ear cans sound great and while the don't cancel out noise like many Bose and higher end phones they are definitely DAMN close . One thing I recommend d because these are built exactly like my Samsung ones as far as how the fold and even have the same exact style hinges is to NOT fold them up fast it hard. Be gentle and fold them slowly. I wasn't too much with my Samsung and while I was somewhat careful the Samsung ones cracked at the hi get points and I had to super flu them just right to fix them but to also have them foldable too. I WISH they supported two Bluetooth gadgets so I could switch from cable box to my FireTV stick but can't. I have to often turn off my cable box to pair them to my Fire Stick where's my other BT headphones can pair to up to 5 devices so that'd be my only complaint and itsnt even really that big of deal, it'd just be convenient is all. Overall I give them and easy 4 stars and will prob buy a newer style paid that I see they also pair hopefully with a bit more less-rugid padding at the top but other than that they're great! Awesome highs and REAAAALY nice lows but not super low as many have said but if you have an equaliz5 on the device using them with which damn near every smartphone, TV, cable box, DVD player etc do, you can fine tune e them and they'll be plenty LOUD EASILY! Again, these are definitely NOT better than Bose as many have said. It's simy not possible...no idea how they came to that. But In the Summer when I'm using these with 3 fans and an AC running I  my living and dining room I can barely hear any background noise. Not perfect but it really drowns out the noise pretty well.",0
2.0,I had these for two months and loved them; I even bought a second pair for ...,"November 22, 2017",Yes,"I had these for two months and loved them; I even bought a second pair for my son. I charged them two times, and they worked perfectly. Then, mysteriously, I charged them again, and they no longer will hold a charge. I can connect to my phone when they are on the charger, but when I remove them, they don't work. Obviously, I want them for their Bluetooth capability. Pretty frustrating...1-19-2018 UPDATE..The folks at Patozon, who sold me this item, sent me a replacement shortly after I complained. I've had it for a couple of months now, and it works beautifully. They've checked in numerous times to ensure my satisfaction. I can tell you now that this is the best headset for the money anywhere, and Patozon is a marvelous company. Don't delay! Grab you Mpow headphones today!",2
5.0,BANG FOR A BUCK!!,"August 5, 2018",Yes,"I usually dont go out of my way to write reviews... these headphones deserve the attention:..I was on the lookout for a decent pair of wireless headphones for working out/running. These are AMAZING. Sound quality is surprisingly great for the price. They're better than most of my wired phones. I'm sure there are better options out there with a bigger price tag, but this is the best for what you're paying...Design is sleek, durable, and a good weight (not cheap and light, but also not too heavy for comfort). Great fit, snug on the ears, definitely sound cancelling when audio is coming through. Little bulkier, but that's expected with this style. If you want slim, go with something else. But these are very comfortable...Setup is VERY simple. One button to pair with phone, phone picked up the bluetooth signal within seconds...Have NOT tested track skip options, or phone call navigation. I dont plan on using this to answer calls anyway. I'll update if I ever do...PERFECT for what I needed: wireless, high quality sound for my activities...I highly recommend giving these a shot, you will NOT be disappointed.",1
5.0,Beyond worth it!,"August 22, 2018",Yes,"I waited to review this as I'm skeptical as most but I do take gambles every now and again. This paid off! My daily use in these have been for the gym. Even with all the sweat and cardio/weightlifting they do not slip off my head, which was my biggest concern. Sound is more than enough to drown out TV's, gym dance music plus your screamers! This also takes phone calls and no issues with people hearing you. I have also used the aux cable with my computer, also no issues i.e. crackling. This is an amazing headset for the price! If you want to spend another $200.00 for a higher end pair you can probably get a LITTLE lighter pair but these are not heavy to begin with. Ear are probably made for medium or small so if dumbo is your thing I would recommend something else. Hope this helps.",2
4.0,Pretty good overall,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"They’re about what you should expect for the price, standard over the ear head phones, nothing amazing sound quality wise, but fairly quality materials and acceptable recreational sound quality. If you’re getting these for the Bluetooth functionality specifically, look elsewhere as the Bluetooth function leaves much to be desired. I was lucky enough to get them paired and working with a usb dongle with my pc for about 5 minutes, upon restart of the computer they weren’t recognized again. Trying to use them connected to my iPhone and iPad were much easier, but the connection dropped frequently. I finally gave up after several hours of troubleshooting and researching and resolved to the 1/8 by 1/8 aux cord option..If they last a couple months in this state; I’d say they were worth $40 (usb dongle not included...) also the driver the dongle came with was on a mini blue ray disk, and the instructions if you didn’t have access to a capable drive? Use a computer with a blueray disc reader and copy using a flash drive. Oh thanks guys, well thought out suggestion there, how about a download link? You really selling that many headphones you couldn’t afford the server dues for all the traffic? Give me a break.",1
5.0,Covers entire ear &amp; has great sound!!,"January 15, 2018",Yes,"These are fabulous! One of the most important things for me was to cover my whole ear &amp; not just sit on my ear, smashing it to my head. I have TMJ &amp; this causes my ears to be super sensitive, so any prolonged pressure on them gives me a terrible headache. All other headphones I’ve tried said they were over the ear, but weren’t &amp; would cause pain with in minutes of wearing them..These are perfect &amp; I am very happy with them. They are a little heavy so they press a bit on the top of my head, but it’s padded on top &amp; i can live with that. Great sound also!.I am very pleased with these headphones. I did just get them, so if anything changes I’ll update my review.",2
4.0,"Terrible audio stuttering, constantly have to restart the headphones","November 15, 2017",Yes,"Fit and finish of the headphones is decent, and the sound quality is decent. But wow, these headphones have some of the worst audio stuttering I've ever encountered in a Bluetooth headphone. Broken, stuttering audio if you pause your media for over 3 minutes, forcing you to power cycle the headphones to re-establish a solid connection. Happens consistently, regardless of the battery level. Can't recommend with the frequency of stuttering that occurs...Update: The merchant reached out after seeing this review and sent a replacement headset. The new headset functions much better!",3
1.0,Would Not Recommend,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"Not worth it...While the material and feel are pretty good, in addition to how they look and the long battery life, head phones are supposed to do one thing and they should do it well. These head phones fail in audio quality...The audio quality on these head phones is horrendous (so bad that after having them for a week I’ve bought another headset of a different brand). This is unfortunate as I have had luck with mpow brand in the past. Listening to music on these head phones is like listening to it through a tin can. Lacks richness and depth. Would not recommend these head phones.",3
5.0,Fantastic for the price!,"October 9, 2018",Yes,"Edited on 10/29/19:.After leaving a mixed review, a representative contacted me to tell me they had shipped me a new set of headphones to replace my faulty ones. I've since received the new headset. Hopefully this pair lasts!..I appreciate the good customer service, proactively replacing my clearly faulty headphones with new ones. The new set seems to work well. The one thing that makes this headset less than ideal is that it doesn't always work well when you have two devices paired—sometimes you can't pair the second device without disconnecting, and any sound from my phone causes the sound from my computer to stop until I disconnect the phone. They're still pretty great, though, within that small limitation! Good sound, nice look, good customer support, great price point. I definitely recommend them...Original review:.I bought these earlier this year and really, really loved them for a while. Good sound, great for calls, comfortable, nice color, great battery life, excellent price point. I recommended them to several people. Then the fabric started pulling away from the band on top and exposing the foam underneath, which was a pain. But I superglued it back on cause hey, as long as they worked well, I was okay with them looking ugly. Then they stopped connecting to my phone via Bluetooth, which was...90% of why I wanted them. They still connect to my computer, but not reliably and with more static and dropping the signal...Really bummed that they didn't last longer, because I really liked them and was otherwise happy with them. But if they barely last six months, that great price point suddenly looks a lot less impressive.",0
3.0,Decent pair of headphones but poor quality construction.,"May 14, 2018",Yes,"The headphones are decent for the price, the bass is a little on the light side and for a closed back pair of headphones there is quite a bit of audio leak. It is very comfortable and I have been able to wear these for well over 8 hours. I would have given this a 5 star but the fabric on the headband (upper area) is already ripping off exposing the foam underneath which was disappointing to say the least as I wear this at a desk all day with no quick or fast movements and it gets charged on my desk (I don't even fold them up when not in use). The controls on the headset itself should have more of a accented button for each, possibly a indent on the four outer buttons on the wheel?..I would recommend these IF they can fix the very short lived fabric ripping off issue, it appears they used cheap glue that came right out after only 2 weeks of use...Pros.* Can be used as wired or wireless.* Battery is long lasting.* Comfortable for long periods of time.* Can be folded to become more compact for travel.* Can handle 2 bluetooth connections..Cons.* Cheap construction involving the fabric.* Leaks audio even while being a well sealed closed back design.* Buttons on headset not built with tactile feedback to determine button placement (I know they are easy to understand just a small point for future revisions).* Takes too long to power off, have to hold the button for a while. I would suggest a button combination for quick powering off like volume down and volume up at the same time..* Bass is lacking for a closed back headphone regardless if its wireless or not.",2
5.0,Great comfort for the value,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"Great set of headphones for the cost! Very comfortable, cool looking, and easy to use. A single charge seems to last about 12 hours of continuous use - but since I don't use mine continuously, I can get about a week of intermittent use out of them...You need to install the headphone drivers, and make sure your device is bluetooth enabled. My computer didn't have bluetooth, so I purchased a USB 4.0 bluetooth transmitter. There's a moment where the headset syncs with the computer, then you get sound through the headphones...If you're going from wired to wireless sound, the audio quality is really good - there's some very minor static or feedback (very minor) so I noticed it wasn't the same as wired quality, but nothing that really bothered me for long...Overall, I really like this as a replacement for my wired headset - no cords is a HUGE improvement, the cord kept getting caught on my arm or chair, and moving my chair the rollers would often roll over the wire... which was bad. All of that worry is gone now. Awesome upgrade!",1
5.0,"Superb product, so happy with these ones... until I had to use the mic","October 27, 2017",Yes,"I was a little worried about how all the reviews saying it wasn't that strong with the bass, but for my surprise it was really good enough. The quality sound is really good and the Bluetooth connection doesn't lag at all. Also, I've been using them the entire week via wireless around 4h/day and I hadn't need to charge  them at all...UPDATE: I recently came in need to use the ""built-in"" mic. 1.) It's really annoying that it cannot be used over the wire. But the description said it before, so it's fine. 2.) The mic won't work even with wireless, tried it with multiple devices and nothing...UPDATE #2: Months after this review, I was contacted by Patozon (seller) letting me know that because of my review, a replacement was sent for me. The ones sent were a more recent model (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HPB1HQ/ ) and worked flawlessly, these ones actually have a better sound quality, a bit bigger over ear cover (which was pretty convenient since the other ones hurt a bit after using them for long periods of time) and the mic worked just as good. I'm changing my review from 2 to 5 because that's what customer service is about, not to mention, the quality of the replacement was on point.",1
2.0,"Decent sound, but I got a defective one.","May 23, 2018",Yes,"I think I got a bad one from PATAZON.  Returns through them were difficult, so I am just going to deal with Amazon.  I've been looking for a decent budget headphone for a while now.  Looking for quality sound, comfort, and under $50.  When you first put them on, you can hear they aren't ""amazing"" headphones.  The richness of sound just isn't there., and some of the music can sound a bit muddled...but just a bit.  That said, after a few minutes, you no longer notice, and you can really enjoy the sound and feel of the headphones.  They are comfortable and the sound is decent.  My issue is my headphone set just loses volume for no reason.  I tried rebooting the headphones, the phone I connected them too, and obviously my computer.  No fix.  going to try another pair.  definitely worth it.",1
5.0,Exceeded Expectations In Every Way.  Well Done.,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"For the money -- and even for MORE money -- these over the ear headphones are spectacular...I am picky. But these are spectacular.  Why?..1.  They look more expensive than they are.  They are sturdy, stylish...2.  They are very comfortable.  I have a big head. These fit just fine, and are VERY comfortable. These are perhaps the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned, and I have owned dozens of them over the years.  They do not grip your head too tight, nor are they too loose.  The padding on the earpeices is soft and plush, but not overdone or mushy.  These are great to wear...3.  They sound really good.  Many Bluetooth headsets and earphone and heaphones at this price point have a whine or hum or static when no music is playing.  These do not -- they are absolutely silent.  The bass is deep and good.  They are pretty clear-sounding, not muddy.  Very very good sound.  You can pick out all of the crummy audio on YouTube, as compared to the cleaner audio from a service like Spotify or iTunes oor Amazon Music, which means that these can reproduce sound well enough for you to tell the difference.  I'd say that the headphones have a pretty neutral sound, with plenty of bass which does not overwhelm and is not too boomy, considering the price range.  You are never going to get 'best ever"" tight and accurate bass from bluetooth headphones in this price range, but the bass does not offend.  And as I said, I am rather picky, but I can apply a sliding scale based on price.  There are plenty of over-bassed, boomy headphones, and plenty of people who think that sounds good. Ugh.  With regular music, let's face it, you have Bluetooth compression, so it isn't ever going to be audiophile quality over Bluetooth.  But at home or going for a walk, I love these things.  They are so nice, I do not want to work out in them and ruin them or sweat them up. But I'll bet theyy'd be good for working out if you do not mind grody headphones. Lol.  They DO NOT feature active noise cancelling, but the ear cups block out most ambient noise.  Unless you are paying giant dollars, active noise cancellation merely kills battery life, adds noise and lower resolution sound.  Not necessary.  A doodad most do not need, and I do not miss it on these headphones...4.  Mechanics:  They connected via Bluetooth very easily.  When you power them on, they connect relatively quickly. Walking all around  my entire 1200 sqft condo, I never lost the signal, even though the phone was on one side of the condo and I was on the other. They charge via the ubiquitous  micro-USB found on Android phones, though there is a warning not to charge these on anything more than a 5w adapter. The controls are sparse and subtle -- they are not visually obvious so as to ruin the aesthetics of the headphones -- but the controls are easy to find and use.  One power/pairing/play/pause button in the middle; up and down volume and forward and back buttons.  They work great. The charging port is subtly located, adding to the style and class of these very well-though-out headphones...5.  Durability/longevity:  Hey I just bought them.  They seem to be of high quality but time will tell. I have 2 other MPOW products and have owned them for more than a year and they both still work fine, so MPOW seems to have their QC under control...You see things like this at this price point and you think ""Are they worth it?"" and ""will it sound like garbage"".  Herere to tell you:  These are worth it, they sound great, and they are a very worthwhile purchase.",8
3.0,like you'd expect from almost any very cheap cans,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"I'm starting to suspect that virtually all Bluetooth headphone / earbud products in existence have flat frequency response, too much bass, and muddy highs. These cans certainly aren't doing anything to convince me otherwise. Passive noise isolation is almost nonexistent, like you'd expect from almost any very cheap cans; with the sound off, I can can run my fingernails lightly over the wall behind me and still hear it quite clearly. Total noise attenuation might be 4dB; possibly less...The two high points so far are:.* Relatively lightweight.* Still comfortable after an hour..I'm worried about the folding mechanism; I'm not certain just how many times I can fold these before something snaps off. At least all(?) the moving parts appear to be some kind of light to medium steel, instead of more plastic...I got these as very inexpensive, relatively acceptable headphones that wouldn't make me worry too much about theft or loss. I think they'll fill that niche, but that's as far as they go.",1
5.0,Solid low end price Bluetooth headphones,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"They're not too bad, good enough audio for me. I hate that it says all it's updates out loud (""power on"", ""pairing"", ""your headset is disconnected"", ""phone 1 connected"", ""phone 2 connected"", ""power off"") and I wish there was some way to disable that. The visual design is pretty good for something this cheap, and it's nice to have the option to plug it in, but I rarely use it and the included cord is rather flimsy. The light always flashes when it is on; when I use them in the dark, sometimes I think I see something but it's just that the headphones are flashing. They stay pretty well on my head, and I find them really comfortable most of the time. They aren't appropriate for use while running or exercising or anything like that. If you're having issues with audio cutting out, make sure you don't have any other Bluetooth devices connected with the device you're listening to. Also the microphone isn't really something you can use it for, at least on Windows. But all in all they're really good for the price point, and they work and sound good almost all the time. I'd only rate them 4 stars, but the fifth star is for value.",1
5.0,Just STUNNING!,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"From the outset, let me say that I am not a headphone person, although I do own a number of headphone and ear bud types ranging from fairly low cost ones to some costing a few hundred dollars.  I do use them from time to time, but always felt restricted by the cable and by the inevitable discomfort if I wore them for any length of time.  I have never owned a Bluetooth headphone frankly because of the expense and my overall dissatisfaction with earphones.  For the record, I am a mid-60 year old audio-aholic (someone who loves music to the extreme in all forms and types and formats) and over the past few years have returned to my analog roots - vinyl (played on my several turntables and cartridges), and cassettes (played on nice Nakamichi systems).  But I also have my pulse on the digital front too with a number of DAPs, iPods, FLAC-capable systems and the like.  Bottom line, I know my music from 50 years of playing it.  So tonight, after my Mpow 059 headphones arrived from Amazon, I charged them for a couple of hours on my MacBook, paired them and turned on my large New Age Mix.  That was three hours ago, and these phones are effortless and transparent!  I have to say that I am blown away that for less than $30 I received one of the best-sounding, highest quality, most capable headphones I have ever purchased.  They truly are remarkable!  Are they as good as my higher end phones?  I will leave that for now, but something tells me that if you try these out, you will not touch your more expensive wired headphones for awhile!  Just saying....",1
5.0,"DECENT HEADPHONES, I LIKE THEM A LOT","November 30, 2018",Yes,"These hold a charge for several hours and charge easily on the included USB cable, and are easy enough to use. I bought these for myself to use with my Surface Pro 4 laptop-tablet combo. I use the headphones via blue tooth when my husband is watching something I don't want to watch on TV while sitting next to me. At times I'd rather put headphones on use my computer rather than watch tv, so the headphones allow me to do that without the sound from my computer interrupting my husbands TV show, or his TV show drowning out my computer. I'm very happy with these now I can listen to my computer in peace &amp; the sound quality is decent. The red color matches my Surface Pro 4  red  detachable key board. The only 'con' for me is that the other included cable has a round shaped end &amp; doesn't attach to any  external  ports on my Surface Pro 4. I believe that cable is more designed for use with a smart phone.  The cable is supposed to attach the headphones directly to your  device for when the batteries run out &amp; blue tooth is not an option. I am going to look into getting some type of adaptor for the cable, if something like that exists. Regardless of that, I still really like these headphones and I hope they will last me a long time.",0
5.0,These headphones are good..,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are good.....but sadly the pair I purchased lost blue tooth function after two weeks (15 days).  Since I used these solely for gym work it made them worthless to me.  I attempted to contact the manufacturer for replacement or repair but the website 'contact' button didn't work.  Based on those facts I have to complain about these phones.  But I will say that prior to the Bluetooth failure I was happy with the product.  Just that without it these are just another wired pair of headphones and now I have to buy a new set (not mpow),  MPOW if you are reading this I would still love to hear from you so we can get these fixed...Update.......And Mpow sent me another one that works just perfect.  Its comfortable (which is important since I use them for gym work) and the new one has been going strong for over a month already.  I want to thank Mpow for this since it makes me a loyal customer in the future when you stand behind your product this well.",3
5.0,Re-Review - New Headphones,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"I purchased the Mpow 059 headset and originally submitted a 2 star review based mainly on the low volume issues.  However, I am submitting a new review and changing it to a 5 star rating based mostly on their customer service...When they saw my rating they offered to send me a different set of headphones and when I accepted, they sent me the Mpow H2 headphones.  Now, these new headphones have a very slightly higher volume and they are on-ear instead of over-ear, but the sound quality is better - more crisp...Like I said above, this is a little tricky since this 5 star rating is based primarily on their customer service and their desire to resolve the issue and not on the quality of their product.  I guess you get what you pay for and this is one of the pitfalls of buying on-line and not actually testing the products in person...I applaud Mpow for trying to make this right!",1
5.0,Awesome Headphones!!!,"October 22, 2018",Yes,"I got these because they looked good.  The price kind of scared me because, usually you get what you pay for.  Oh my gosh, I love these headphones.  I have a small head and they fit me perfectly , (I have a peanut head).  The ear muffs cover my ears very comfortably and stay put.  Programing is so easy, it talks you through the process.  The sound is great all around.  Battery life is awesome. Overall, I really got my moneys worth.",2
1.0,POS!,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"I read all these ""wonderful"" reviews and I have to have to wonder, are they all employees of Mpow? I've had mine long after the return window so I can't send the POS back. I have tried everything that tiny little manual ( which I need a magnifier to read) said to do! I even charged it with the recommended 5V charger. In short, it worked when it wanted to and when it did it sounded great. It paired with my Sony blu ray player just fine. I turn it on and get the power on voice and the blue indicator then put in a dvd, headphones on and NOTHING! then the next day it works then stops even though it's on ( blue indicator) Then I say! ah! it's my blu ray player! So I unplugged it and plugged it back in then check they tiny manual to make sure I do things right and NOTHING! same outcome.  Thoroughly disgusted with it it is now wall decoration and smashed to pieces. Rant over!",2
5.0,Comfortable headphone with good sound,"September 13, 2018",Yes,I mostly use mine with a cable so I don't have to worry about whether they are charged or not. I have used the BT connection and it was easy to pair. I ride a lot of buses so I listen to audio books or radio on the bus. These work well and the price is pretty reasonable.,4
4.0,"No real bass, still no real problem! Good headphones!","February 28, 2018",Yes,"Ordered these headphones just a few days ago, and came in a bit earlier than expected...Based on what others have said (mostly the 3 star and below reviews), these were supposed to break within days/are supposed to be uncomfortable/have a bad mic/lousy sound, etc. I haven't experienced any of these issues...Sure, they don't have a really deep bass, but the sound quality is pretty good. I don't hear any static or the like, it doesn't sound any different than my gaming USB headset; overall, I don't have any complaints whatsoever about the sound, other than the bass. That, however, was easily overlooked as everything else was fine...I've also read of some battery life complaints. So far, I haven't had any issues with that either. I recharged the batteries the night my headphones came in and hadn't charged them since, using the bluetooth mode for over 7 hours. I'd say that's WAY more than decent. There's always the aux cord they came with if the batteries did die, which I was FULLY expecting to use 100% of the time, but I never needed to use the cord. Not yet anyway...I haven't tested it with a phone call, but I did use them for a Discord chat when my mic broke. I was actually surprised to have a mic. According to my friends, they mic wasn't that great and the sound from the call was worse, so I CAN'T recommend these headphones for any phone calls. However, I DO use them for music on my phone, as I said via bluetooth, and it paired up just fine...They definitely are the most comfortable pair I've had, next to my USB gaming headset, and they fit over my ears nicely. Kept my ears warm in cold weather too! I just don't know for sure if sound leaks out or not. I haven't had an opportunity where it would matter, but I would assume the sound doesn't leak out, provided you keep your headset AND your device at a decent volume (you read that right, the headphones keep their own volume as well. Pretty nifty!)..Some reviews say they stop working after a few days, up to maybe a few months. I've only had mine for a few days and they still seem to work as intended. Then again, I'm not too worried as long as I have the cord it came with. If anything, I would say just be careful with them like you would with a PS4, a TV, a computer, your phone, or the like. Don't misuse your equipment and it won't break right away. Not to say other customers are too rough, more-so just fold them carefully and whatnot...So yeah, other than the lack of a real bass-feel with these headphones, I really like them and I'm glad I made the investment!",1
4.0,Really Surprised!!,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"I just got these. i charged them up, took about 3 hours for the initial charge. Paired to my Galaxy 8 really easy. The sound isn't 100% amazing but its 95% good. It cancels out a lot of noise. It fits snug around my ears and my head without being so tight to give me a headache. I tested them out doing laundry, i live in about a 900 sq ft apartment, went all over the apartment with my phone being in my room and didnt lose connection. I cant wait to try these at the gym. I do notice however a slight buzzing but i got use to it after an hour and didnt notice it with any other songs. They are very light weight as well. I may purchase another pair for my husband.",2
1.0,Would Give It Negative Stars,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"First the pros: The battery life is truly amazing. I charGe it like once a week and I am good to go. The sounds quality at first is amazing but that lasts about 2 months. It is also pretty good at noise cancelling...The cons:.1. The product fell apart on me after about 2 months. I mean physically fell apart as in the fabric starts falling off and then the cushion part starts falling off and I tried to work with it. I kept using it because sound was still coming out and for the price it is to be expected...2. Then it started having problems connecting about a couple of weeks later. So it would connect to my phone and my computer and then automatically this connect itself and I would have to turn it off and start over. Then weirdly enough it started connecting directly with my phone as soon as I turned it on even though the bluetooth function on my phone was off, I tested it a couple of times and then saw that the actual bluetooth on my phone turn blue when the voice on the headphones says pairing (it creeped me out a lot)...3. After all of that, it started beeping and I have checked, its not the battery. It's this nonstop just beeping every couple seconds. You can't hear anything over the beep because it stops your thing that's playing to beep...4.The customer service is not great. They offer to swap the product after 30 days but you have to pay for shipping to their warehouse in California which for me ends up being about half of the cost of product and they won't reimburse me for that full amount...I know people want to say you get what you pay for but honestly not in this case. There are headphones under $30 that work well longterm without all of these problems and I didn't pay for bad customer service. I am not some know it all expert on headphones, I just want ones that work and I read a lot of great reviews which is why I went with this one but just know these things can happen. It was overall a really long, frustrating and negative experience.",0
3.0,"Works good, just not on PC...","July 8, 2018",Yes,"So I bought these to use on my PC..they work well and connect without any trouble. Thing is when I use them for voice chatting people say that I sound far off or muffled. When I listen to music on youtube, the music sounds far off. (not sure if im doing something wrong or there are drivers/software that would help..have not found any) When I connect with my phone and use for voice chatting its very clear and works perfectly. Same with me hearing other people/music works perfect. I would suggest these to someone that is using them on/for the phone. Have not tried with any other device. The cord is also very short, but a basic android charger fits them. I also have not used the connector cable on the PC because I really want wireless..",1
4.0,Awesome! Except one thing...,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones! They are nice at work to drown out the sounds of the cube farm. They hold a nice charge. I ordered these in January and, even with daily, cordless use with Bluetooth connected to my phone, I've only had to charge them three times! They are fairly light but I do move them around a bit during use or I get a sore spot on my head. The volume controls for the music are perfect. It's a bit weird to have a phone conversation with them on because it's hard to hear yourself talking to the person on the other end. They can hear me just fine I just have to be careful not to yell. I didn't purchase them for phone conversations so it's not a big deal...So, they're near perfect. Why did I give them 4 stars? I had to knock down my rating from 5 stars to 4 because the voice prompts are obnoxiously loud! If I'm listening to my usual classical music and a call comes in on my cell phone (I'm obviously connected via Bluetooth) I nearly hit the ceiling because the voice prompt is so loud! When I turn the headphones on and off I put them over my leg and my coworkers a couple of cubicles away can hear the voice prompt. There is no way I can turn them on/off with the headphones on my ears...They're great headphones, especially for the price, but I wish there was a way to turn the voice prompt down.",0
5.0,"The absolute BEST Bluetooth headphones, and at a great price too!","August 19, 2018",Yes,"I have a (just turned) 8 year old son, and we’ve had these for over a YEAR now. He uses them DAILY, and we’ve never had even ONE issue! As you can imagine, he’s a kid...He treats his possessions pretty well, but still...Daily use, for over an entire YEAR, and ZERO problems!?!? I would buy these again and again. The sound is so good...No kidding here, they rival my Beats! These are the absolute BEST bluetooth headphones especially for the price. Plus, green is his favorite color, and they match his iphone case perfectly!.He needed headphones for school this year, and I wanted to buy him the same ones, but just with a traditional cord, and without the Bluetooth feature, but unfortunately they only make a Bluetooth version (or if MPow does, I can’t find them)! and his school requires then to have a cord. These are possibly the most value I have ever gotten out of buying an item for him, and he has every game system on the market plus soooo many accessories...These have never let us down, and they are at an unbelievably good price, especially when you look at all of the usage they’ve endured...We’ve brought them with us on vacations, to doctor appointments, you name it. Never ONE problem with the sound, connectivity, or anything else. They’ve been dropped, they’ve been grabbed by his friends back and forth (playing...ya know, kids), and they amaze me, because they sound GREAT and are still going strong, AND the mechanisms that fold them down still feel and work like the day they came out of their box!!.I really hope they keep them exactly as they are, and don’t “update” them, because I will absolutely purchase another pair or two. They’re the best Bluetooth headphones on the market, imho. Highly recommend!",1
3.0,Sound? Controls? Connectivity? 1 out of 3 ain't good enough,"July 6, 2017",Yes,"I ordered a few headphones to compare sound, controls and connectivity. The good news is these have superior connectivity. They reconnect to your device or transmitter quickly. They have very good range and have no static. The downside are the controls. You can't feel them so you have to figure out how to find the buttons by ""touch memory"" which isn't easy. If they raised the buttons the problem would be solved. Otherwise you're left fiddling with finding the volume or power button. Not fun. The other problem is the sound quality. It's just ok but for this price, I expect better. When you compare them to other headphones that cost just 10 bucks more, the difference is profound. These do not pick up many subtle sounds in movies and songs. They're not clear and crisp. They're muddy/dull.",2
4.0,Nice headphones for the price,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"I've had the MPOW 59 headphones for about 2 months and I've enjoyed them. I have small ears, so they fit very well when adjusted properly. I can wear them for hours with no problems. I like the fact that I can bend over or look down without them falling off..I've used them with my Galaxy S9 and my Gear VR, and it sounds very good. I can connect it to my computer and phone at the same time. I've also had it connected to my Galaxy S5 and S9 at the same time...It does seem quite sturdy. It's lightweight and has good padding for the top of your head. They told up nice so they fit in the nice drawstring pouch that came with it..One more thing I like, is you can plug then in too with the enclosed wire. (Even though many phone's 3.5 mm ports are disappearing) They have nice sound for the price...Things that could be better. The buttons. They are almost flat. It makes it a bit difficult to feel where the center becomes the up, down, left and right..The voice prompt seems louder than what the volume is set. Also, whenever I start a video or press to go to the next video, it says ""Mute"". But it doesn't mute...All in all, they are nice Bluetooth headphones for the price. I would recommend them.",0
4.0,Excellent,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"Update: Head set - every 5 minutes - keeps saying ""beep-beep, phone 1 connected"". Totally annoying. Cant make it stop. No answer as to why this is happening...Original review - Not bad for the price. Not Bose quality but decent. No noise cancellation but it says that. One drawback are the headset buttons. Difficult to raise or lower the volume without taking the headset off to see what you are doing or you will push the wrong button. Using it with your phone for answering calls can be annoying due to the button arrangement. Pairing was simple. Setting the equalization on your phone or computer will make the sound reproduction better. Charging is simple, I can use my 5 volt Android phone charger or the one that is supplied. Fit and comfort is very good over the ears. Folds up easily for storage. I'll see over time if the less than quality headset buttons hold up, if so I'll give it 4 stars. Since I received these we're having zero issues with the functionality of the buttons. This is why I changed my rating to 5 stars..However, the customer service and support for this product is way beyond excellent. They stand behind their product and I fully support any company who does so in the manner they do. I highly recommend these headphones. I'm thoroughly delighted.",0
4.0,"Very good for the price, but they do have their flaws.","May 12, 2018",Yes,"These are pretty good earphones for the price. One thing that really impressed me about them was how long they could hold a charge. I haven't kept track exactly, but they've easily lasted me 15+ hours on Bluetooth. Maybe that battery life will decrease over time, I don't know, but for right now, that longevity is incredible. When I first got them, they felt a little tight on my head, but they've loosened up a lot, while still staying securely around your ears so they don't fall off and people around you don't hear your music. A couple of things I don't like about these headphones...one, there is this British voice that talks every time you turn them on, turn them off, pair with the computer, etc. While I do think this is helpful to let people know when these connections are made, I wish there was a way to disable it, or at least make the notification a beep instead of a voice. It's getting really annoying to hear that lady's voice every time I turn them on. Second, these have almost NO bass.",1
5.0,The curse of the broken headphones has finally lifted!!!,"April 12, 2018",Yes,"Take note that the pictures are taken after a year of abuse and being thrown around and rolled on when I sleep. It's to show that they still work amazing even after all of this. These are the best pair of headphones I've ever had. I'm just forgetful and have a tendency to lose the AUX cord, but that's of my own fault, so if you get them, always remember where you put the cord! The cord in the pictures is not the same one that came with it because I lost that one, to be completely honesy. I've had these for about a year now, and the plastic has cracked in some places, but the great thing is, they still hold up, and they still work fine. I had a tendency to fall asleep listening to music or watching something, and I'm not very heavy, but repeated pressure of surely rolling on them probably lead to that, and even though some of the cushion has cracked, that's just from wear. I'd buy these over Beats any day of the year, and I know for a fact when these finally go from good ol' wear and abuse, I'll be buying another pair of them. Completely worth the money! Take it from the girl who has always had the curse of the broken headphones!",1
3.0,Very good inexpensive wireless headphones,"May 17, 2017",Yes,"If you want an inexpensive wireless headphones these are not bad.  Sound quality is very good. I've paired mine with my iPad Pro, iPhone 6plus, and my Microsoft Surface Pro 4. I use mine primarily at work to listen to music, listen to web conferences, and VoIP calls. Range is really good as is the battery. I also like that they include a wired connection so you can use it as a traditional wired headphone. The only negatives I have with it is that the buttons are kinda clumsy feeling (if it had some sort of raised nubs it would make finding the controls easier) and it is kinda heavy but not too bad - the padding does help.  Overall it's still a great headphone.",4
5.0,Great value for money,"October 20, 2018",Yes,"These are decent for the price. Passive noise cancelling works (I used them on a plane and the noise bleed through wasnt unbearable but it was there). Sound quality is actually pretty impressive. They do pinch my ear just a tad if I'm not careful in placement but that only gets annoying with long time wear (11 hour flight from west coast of US to Paris... ).Love that they are wireless. Use them with my phone, ipod, and computer I can have music anywhere..Do they compare to a set of bose/sony/beats?? Not even in the same state as the ballpark. But for $30ish ... its 1/10 the cost. One day I'll splurge for the good ones. Until then these will do me just fine",1
4.0,Great quality and features especially for the price!,"June 8, 2017",Yes,"Very pleased with these headphones.  I didn't want to spend a fortune on wireless headphones, but wanted something comfortable and reasonably priced for using at the gym and also running.  Comfort is excellent.  Very pleased with how good they feel on my head and how they stay put while jogging.  Sound quality is also good.  Not great, a little on the muffled side and I wish there were more highs coming through, but still sounds very good and especially for this price I can't complain.  If you want high end sounding headphones spend $200 or more...  Battery life also seems to be very strong.  I've charged them the first day, and have been using them for over a week for at least an hour at the gym 6 days a week and still going strong...Controls are easy to use while on your head and buttons are laid out nicely that they are easy to find with your fingers while wearing.  Another feature I like is that although they are not noise cancelling headphones, they do an excellent job not allowing outside noise to leak in.  My other headphones I would still hear the background music at the gym bleeding through, not with these.  Time will tell how long they will last, but as far as first impressions, I haven't seen a better set around or even double the price of these.",1
5.0,"Amazing sound, cheap price and a snug fit. With a pretty decent build.","May 9, 2017",Yes,"I was looking for some over ear headphones that I could use to work out with. I chose these because of the reviews and pricing. I chose over ear primarily because I wanted wireless, and headphones that weren't going to constantly fall out my ears. These head phones come in a plane packaging, with an aux cable and soft carrying bag for the headphones. The headphones fit pretty snug which is nice because when i went running they were falling off or sliding back, they held up perfecting fine. The sound quality was really good, I expected some pretty bad lows or even bad highs but the headphones have a great balance. Pairing it by bluetooth to my cell phone was pretty easy (if you can follow directions). The build quality is ok, the gloss black seems like it would scratch easily. I use this for both running and lifting weights, and it hasnt had any issues with falling off at all. Great headphones for the price",10
4.0,Not bad,"August 1, 2018",Yes,"I’ve given these headphones 4 stars for the price, the relative comfort, and the ease of use. They fit on the head firmly, and depending on how big your ears are they are comfortable for long periods of time. The headphones connect with your phone/tablet quickly, and I can pass from one room to the next without losing the connection. On the side of the ear pieces, there are very simple controls that make it super easy to skip songs, pause, or raise the volume. So, for the price? Great purchase. However, there are a few problems that may be dealbreakers for some...First of all, if you’re a wireless headphone aficionado, then this is not for you. The quality of these headphones have nothing on the higher priced options out there. Second, the sound is not very good. Music comes out somewhat flat and the bass is no bueno. If you’re looking for choice dub and drops, you’re not going to find it here. Lastly, the cord it comes with (should you choose not to go wireless) crapped out in about a month with very limited use. I was disappointed with that, for sure. Otherwise this is a great pair of headphones for the casual listener and newbies in regards to wireless. I don’t regret this purchase at all.",0
5.0,"Great quality, price, battery, Bluetooth, and fit!","November 17, 2018",Yes,"For the price of these headphones, I am more than happy I didn’t upgrade to wireless Beats! Over the past few years I’d been using Beat solos. They had amazing sound but were on-ear and wired; so when I got the iPhone 8, I had to use the aux to lightning adapter. Let’s just say that being wired was a pain enough but having to use the adapter was an extra struggle... Anyways, I did a ton of research and just didn’t want to throw down $200-$300 for wireless beats, especially since the over-ear ones cost even more. Coming on Amazon, I noticed the 16,000+ reviews for the Mpows and compared both the reviews and descriptions to other well-rated headphones on here. I asked for them for my birthday and wasn’t disappointed...The sound quality is pretty great although I wouldn’t say perfect. As for the volume, I at first found it funny that the volume on the headphones is different from the volume on your phone (you have to turn the phone volume up THEN turn the headphone volume up or down). However, I actually like that as it helps me make sure the headphones aren’t on full blast when I put them on...I’m thrilled with the over-ear fit; for my ears it truly is over-ear and I’d say my ears are average size. They’re also comfortable to wear with glasses/sunglasses. The overall comfort when wearing them is great! Headband is comfortable, earpads are comfortable, etc. While they are adjustable, I personally don’t need to adjust the headband for my fit...I have yet to try them wired, but that’s because a) I’d only ever use that if the batteries died and b) the battery is so freaking long I’ve yet to drain it in full! I charge them every night and also make sure to turn them off and charge them whenever they’re not in use...The drawstring bag they come with is nice quality, but I still wish they came with a hardcase instead. My Beats came with a softcase and even that wasn’t heavy duty enough in my taste. I’m definitely not going to just throw them in my bags when I travel...The Bluetooth pairing is easy as pie! I was able to quickly pair with my iPhone and now it connects automatically whenever I turn Mpow on. It also tells me the battery percentage with a little headphone icon next to my phone’s battery in the notification bar. Although I wish it would also say it in the control panel like airpods do, I’m happy to know the battery percentage at all...There is only one flaw that I find with these headphones. As someone who travels often and has to share bedrooms, it drives me crazy that when they are on the Bluetooth Indicator flashes every 6 seconds. I can’t see it unless I’m in front of a mirror or in a dark room, but I know that when I’m sharing a room at night, and my roommates are trying to sleep, it’ll piss them off. I’m going to have to put a post-it note or non-damaging tape over the control buttons to diffuse the bright, blinking lights. While it makes sense for the indicator lights to flash when you’re holding the headphones in your hand turning them on, off, or pairing them, it makes absolutely NO SENSE why there should be lights whilst you can’t even see them while they’re on your head. Plus, everyone knows blue light is the worst at night; it tends to light up a room more and keep you awake. This really frustrates me when I’m planning to use these late at night.....Overall,..I really do love these headphones...Great quality.Great price.Comfortable.Long-lasting battery.Easy-to-use Bluetooth..With the only real flaw being the Bluetooth Indicator lights",0
5.0,Bluetooth stopped working after only a couple months - Received replacement promptly.,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"I really liked these Headphones, the sound was good, the comfort was there, but here it is 2 months past being able to return them and they dont work.  I used them last night without issue, came in this morning charged them up like I always do before using them and now they will not turn on.  The red light does not come on when I try to charge them.  Now they will not work as Bluetooth headphones which is why I bought them.  I guess I can reach out to the company for a warranty repair.  Which is what I will probably do, but if these things only last a couple months then they will only get a 1 start review from me...Update:  I sent an e-mail about my issue and they said to mail the headphones back and that once they receive them they will ship back a new pair and pay me for shipping.  Today I received a brand new pair of headphones that work great.  Thank you very much, review has been updated to reflect their customer service, I will update in a couple months if these things are still working and I just got a bad pair...Thanks MPOW!!",21
1.0,Not at all worth the money!,"January 7, 2018",Yes,This product was very cheaply made. The speakers were terrible and had no bass. The mic for the phone did not work at all. Made several different calls and I had to yell into the phone for them to barely make out what I was saying. I’m very unhappy with this product. I just gave it to my kid for toy headphones.,6
2.0,"Good sound quality, awful on/off system, disappointing battery life.","September 3, 2018",Yes,"Pretty good audio quality: better than other cheap headsets and a decent amount of bass/power, but still worse than my 30x Audio Technicas and PS Gold headphones. Both of those are usually more expensive, so that's fine...The actual physical build of the thing feels nice and sturdy while being soft in the right places, but did hurt to wear for extended use. The mic worked well. But a pile of annoyances and a disappointing battery life led me to give up on these after a few months...Annoying blue LED blinks constantly while in use, making it a poor choice for nighttime and places you don't want to disturb others. Audio prompts blare at max volume for many of its functions and warnings...It took me a while to get used to its on/off functionality, as it takes 5 seconds of holding the button down to do so, according to the manual. In practice it was even longer than that. That's a ridiculous amount of time to waste holding down a crummy garage-door-button-quality switch...I eventually got to the point where I could get the thing to turn off reliably, but its battery life was still much shorter than I was hoping for. In practice I was getting maybe 5 hours on average. Perhaps it would be closer to the advertised battery life if I used it continuously after unplugging it rather than using it in a stop and go fashion...But it turns out I don't want to leave this thing and its blinking LEDs plugged in all the time, and I expect it to hold its charge if I leave it on the shelf for a day.",1
4.0,Great!,"July 14, 2017",Yes,"They stay put! Sound isn't the best, and it isn't noise cancelling. But I think these are worth the buy. They are wonderful so far!",13
3.0,"Good for music, and not so good outdoor hands free phone use","July 7, 2018",Yes,"This product seems to be a knock off of the previous brand ""Senty"". The price is good. Maybe a little more expensive than when Senty had them on Amazon..I also notice that it isinferior to the Senty brand of the same design and battery capacity. The Senty brand had noise cancellation...This one does not have the feature of noise cancellation.  You need to be where the noise is minimal. I wonder why they made this product without noise cancellation. I use to enjoy talking in the Streets of Manhattan without people complaining about the background noise on the Senty model..I MPOW-059 is listening..Is this brand owned by Amazon or what?..Overall, you do get good sound without needing to hear the base on a loud speaker.",1
5.0,We like them. They are comfortable (after break in),"July 27, 2018",Yes,"*** Update ***.After 20 months of use one of our headphones is beginning to flake around the ear pads.  They still work but the earpads are not replaceable.  This is a shame because once broken in the cans are reasonably comfortable, provide good sound reproduction and block out outside noises.  At ~$35.00 a pair we got lots of use out of them and would still recommend them but be aware that once the pads are gone these cans will need replacing.  There are some other budget options with replaceable pads and these might be better for the environment.  Better still MPOW just redesign these to have replaceable ear pads...My husband and I both have a pair of these headphones.  We like them.  They are comfortable (after they are broken in, they are a bit tight at first) sound good and work as well on Bluetooth as they do plugged into an audio cable.  To our geeky ears they sound good but we are not audiophiles.  The battery lasts a long time when used in Bluetooth mode and they do a relatively good job of blocking background noise.  I compared them with a pair of expensive Bose noise cancelling phones and discovered they couldn't completely block the baby crying behind my airline seat either.  For 10% of the price these do at least 90% of the job.  They may not be the sexiest headphones around but they work well and when we wear them out (one well used pair is already 1.5 years old and still holding up just fine) we would buy again.  We like these cans and would recommend them.",1
3.0,"Looks amazing, sounds meh.","January 17, 2018",Yes,"So, I've had these for almost two months now, and figured I had to let others know what the real deal is..Pros:.- Style. These look amazing! Seriously, I get compliments almost every day when I wear them out. People keep asking me if they're Beats. Clearly, they've never seen Beats before lol.- Comfort. These are surprisingly comfortable. I have larger ears, and these fit very comfortably around them. Sure there's slight discomfort at times and some sweating, but that's to be expected with over ear. I can confidently say that I can wear these for 4 hours and not really need to take them off once..-Multi-device support. So convenient to connect my phone and my laptop to these at the same time so I don't have to keep switching back and forth..- Navigation. It's incredibly easy to use, and connecting is a breeze. Once you're connected, you never have to worry about it and can cycle through everything without touching what these are connected to. The clickable buttons are perfect for not guessing what button you're using...Cons:.- Range. These are absolutely horrible sometimes with regards to range. I'll have my phone in my pocket, and sometimes the sound will go out while I'm walking. I had a pair of Bluedio Turbine's before this, and they enabled me to leave my phone in my bedroom and go to my kitchen without any problem (yes even with walls in the way), these however, can barely get through a song when I walk more than 7 feet away. Disgraceful..- Sound Quality. Let me start off by saying these aren't bad on sound persay. However, my personal tastes just weren't met. If you're a hip hop or r&amp;b lover, these aren't the headphones for you. The bass on my Bluedio's wasn't the greatest but it did the trick, these however, sound like the bass is happening two rooms away from you. Very disappointing. I never tested quality with the aux cable, because let's be real, these are Bluetooth headphones, if I wanted wired headphones, I would've bought some..- Phone Calls. While everyone could hear me fine, there was always a strange clicking noise in the background according to those on the other side. Apparently it got really annoying at times. I never had trouble hearing other people. Otherwise, answering and hanging up we're a breeze..- Battery Life. I charged my Bluedio's maybe once every week. Granted, I'm a heavier than average user, but these headphones barely lasted two days. Really frustrating when I have to keep them plugged in all the time...Overall, you're getting what you pay for. However, compared to others of the same price, this sacrifices a lot just for minor improvements in aesthetics and comfort. If only these had more bass in them and a longer battery life, I think I'd be happier. For now, to the junk drawer you go...Update 03/2018:.I have received extremely courteous and helpful customer service from this product's manufacturer, Patozon. They promptly contacted me after my review was posted, listened to my concerns, and provided me with a replacement product (Mpow H1). While the Mpow H1 was definitely better than the Mpow 059, it still had some similar issues while lacking the sleekness in design. All-in-all, I am extremely impressed with the customer service I received from Patozon, and will definitely consider them for my future purchases. However, as my original review was tied to the product and not the company, my stars remain the same.",15
5.0,Listening to them now!,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"I'm using these headphones as I write this review. (Currently listening to Don't Want to Miss a Thing by Aerosmith).I am extremely impressed with the quality of these headphones for the price. I was a little bit leery of going with an unknown brand of headphone, but I am pleasantly surprised..I am in no way a headphone connoisseur, and keep in mind my ears are not as attune as others when it comes to quality, bass, treble, etc. but as for me, just wanting to listen to my music; they're perfect! Not sure how long the battery last yet as I'm still on my first charge, but I'm sure they'll last me the day at school and gym..As for the comfort, it's probably as comfortable as you can expect headphones to be. They fit over my ears pretty well, and are adjustable depending on how large your head is. They also fold up and come with a aux cord in case the battery dies. Would purchase these a million times over, and would recommend to those who are looking for a good pair for a good price!.(No, I did not get these at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review -- I just like helping people make decisions!)..P.S. Volume controls on the right side are super easy to navigate.",1
5.0,YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE! They work perfectly for my Autistic son!!!!,"August 22, 2018",Yes,We bought these headphones because my autistic son would wear my Beats Wireless and has broken them on a couple of occasions. I finally broke down and bought these for him so that he could have his own pair and they are incredibly durable with great sound quality. I am incredibly impressed. I will more than likely be buying a couple pairs for my family to use on vacations and flights. YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE!!! I would give them more than 5 stars if that were an option!,2
5.0,Definitely recommend these,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"My son is 8 and has small ears lol! He hates having earphones on and/or in his ears.  These are quite comfortable.  I knew if he didn’t like them, I could use them.  He wears them a lot.  They also paid to his iPod Touch so when he is making calls he can talk through them.  Being wireless is another plus.  He got these as a Christmas gift so he has only been using them a few days, but the fact that he WANTS to wear them is a high plus and so is the complete wireless component.  The bag they sent to hold them in is also neat.  Would definitely recommend.",2
4.0,Mic stopped working after 4,"October 28, 2017",Yes,"UPDATE: I received a replacement from the sender. That was very nice of them. This unit's microphone does work much better, so it appears as if the hardware (mic) was defective. We will see what happens in the next few months if the mic fails again. Otherwise, I am glad they are reading and acknowledging the comments and ratings...I used this at work so I can teleconference. Not even four months and the microphone died. Not worth it.",3
5.0,A good working pair of BT Headphone for a good Price!,"February 9, 2018",Yes,"After much consternation and roaming through a lot of the Bluetooth Headphones, I finally settled on these.  I did a lot of reading and comparing before settling, so I hope they work out well for me.  So far I have had just a little time to use them but from my initial use I have found they are well worth the research.  I wasn't looking for the world's best but I wanted a good pair of headphones that both looked good but also sounded good.  I wear hearing aids so I wanted something that would fit over my ears and not on them.  I also wanted something that had good base, with highs and lows that would not torture my hearing aides and me. (Both blowing out my hearing aides or my hearing  as I am hard of hearing not deaf)...Other than the bit of white noise you experience (and it is really minor and low) in between song, quiet time during gaming and TV they are really great.  So realistic and all in time with the transmitter.  They were very easy to pair up with my Transmitter (also a Mpow) for my TV and also my PC. All my music sounds as good as with my other headphones that connect.  I also used the wire and no difference between wired and non-wired...I keep these in the bag that came with them as I didn't opt to buy the hard cover (it was a separate.purchase) and I keep them in my home office. The controls are easy enough to keep in mind.... Volume up, down, skipping left or right....center on/off and phone calls. I also stayed with the basic color Red/Black as it was a bit cheaper but that is the color I was originally looking for. A bit sporty.  Everything is black anymore and hard to find so I wanted something that was color contrasting and easy to find/see...So I am hoping to use these for a long time.  Maybe I got lucky and got a good pair for a good price.",0
4.0,Great cheap alternative on Bluetooth Headphones,"August 4, 2018",Yes,"So far, i have no problems with the Headphones themselves, just a few minor setbacks and things that could be improved on future releases..*Sound cancellation is bad: even when adjusted and tightened enough, noise from the headphones is kind of loud. This could be bad on a phone call or even while playing music. This can be solved by lowering the volume to mid-low, but who does that?.*Media buttons: the buttons make a circle where Up/Down is for volume and Left/Right for Previous/Next Track. However, since they are not separated, you will press right-ish-down/up or up-left-ish often resulting on nothing or anything, but what you wanted to do...Other than this couple of details, they are great.",1
4.0,"Feel cheap but good sound, great range, long battery life","September 19, 2018",Yes,"the title says it all..feels like they cost 10 bucks, lousy control feel..BUT comfy enbough for hours, the passive noise reduction is worth about 10dB which is decent, sound quality for general use is great, for music it's acceptable but very lacking in bass and maximum volume, battery life is forever, they pair nearly instantly, they have much much better range than my other bt earphones - like 10-15 feet better, or approx 50%..overall i'm pleased and would buy again for television use but not for music..I expect a wire failure at the two folding hinge points so will likely epoxy them in the open position.",1
5.0,Initial setup with the phone was as easy as ever,"August 20, 2017",Yes,Using these headphones with my Samsung Galaxy s5 and a computer running Windows 7 64-bit...Initial setup with the phone was as easy as ever...Initial setup with the computer had a small hiccup.  I purchased a new bluetooth dongle (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZIILLI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for use with the headset.  Windows didn't install the workable device drivers for the bluetooth dongle.  Once I downloaded and installed the right drivers for the bluetooth dongle the headset synced with my PC and worked just fine...Headphones are comfortable.  Sound quality is solid.  Exactly what I was looking for when I ordered them.,2
5.0,Fantastic Headphones,"August 20, 2018",Yes,Love these headphones. Got them to use primarily at work to listen to music and to use on my VoIP soft phone. Works great for both. Also used it on my PS4 (although you have to plug it in because Playstation doesn't support Bluetooth devices anymore). The battery in these things is awesome. Seems like I rarely ever charge it. They are very comfortable for prolonged use but I will say that sometimes I'll take one ear piece off in case I'm half listening to outside conversations and it can make your other ear sore. Maybe that's just me. But when wearing properly it's super comfortable. Oh and sound quality is great too. No complaints.,1
3.0,Annoying blue flashing light. Can’t turn it off.,"March 4, 2018",Yes,Easy to use and work great. I have one significant complaint. You can’t possibly use these in the dark because of an annoying blue flashing light ever few seconds. Bought these for travel but I’ll have to get a different pair so I don’t disturb people around me. Was so pumped about these all day until I went to bed and discovered the issue. After reading other reviews it seems you can’t turn this off.,3
3.0,Good as a bad.... But the bad wins.,"June 20, 2017",Yes,"I love these headphones. They're comfortable, good looking and the sound is great. Unfortunately, after about a month now, they tend to short out randomly. They'll shut off (happening more frequently all the time) and as soon as I plug them in, I can restart it. It's really unacceptable. I'd buy them again, or trade them in, but I'm not happy with this particular set.",4
4.0,Good Price. Good Quality. Some Issues.,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"This pair of headphones was exactly what I was looking for! My company recently moved us to an open workspace plan (i.e. long tables with multiple workstations instead of cubes), so I needed a way to counteract the noise increase. These definitely do a good job keeping me focused as I can barely hear anyone around me, but they are not noise-cancelling. For the price, they have pretty good sound quality. They are almost comparable to my boyfriend's $300 headphones!..I did come across a few minor issues. At first, my headphones paired perfectly with my computer. After a few days, I was only getting sound into one of the ears when playing from my computer. When playing from my phone, I had no issues. This is pretty annoying though because I can't just toggle to Spotify on my computer while I'm working. Instead, I have to find my phone, unlock it, open the app... doesn't sound awful, but then I start checking other things on my phone (my bad) and losing productivity. Not sure why pairing became a problem, but it bothers me enough to just use my Apple earpods at times...Another issue is the comfort. I find that wearing these headphones for long stints throughout the day is uncomfortable. It's mostly the very top of the band that causes discomfort. I usually readjust the positioning several times throughout the day, shifting the band around to different spots on the top of my head. I'm looking into adding some extra padding to the band to see if that helps...Overall, I'm happy enough with this purchase and would definitely recommend as entry-level over-the-ear headphones.",0
5.0,"UPDATE: AWESOME Company! Great headset. Quality battery, controls, feel, fit, and great mic.","November 27, 2017",Yes,"UPDATE: I've never seen a company so determined to make EVERY customer happy. They reached out with a response by email and also a response to my review to find out more about what was wrong. They got me a working and high quality set and I am totally sold on this. Great products. Great brand. MPOW! And, my customers I'm calling on the phone have reported no audio issues on this new set!..-----------.Sound is good, BUT the people I talk with on my calls say my voice sounds metallic and ""tingy"". Super comfy, but unfortunately, a bad mic makes them unusable.",2
3.0,Half ok Half not so ok,"February 8, 2018",Yes,"Im not the greatest with typing a bunch due to carpal tunnel but i will try to make this a decent but short review..I really really love these headsets with my compute. They work great for both gaming and streaming the type of music i listen to. I was worried from some of the reviews that music would be an issue but i have not heard an issue with sound. So there is that. As for fit, they fit perfect and cover my ears perfect i suppose someone with a larger head and bigger ears might disagree with me. I read a few of the not so great reviews and people complained how cheaply made they were and easily they broke. Call me an optimist but i dont see that happening unless you just carelessly fling them around and dont take care of them...Now for the bad...I honestly dont know if its the headset or if its the fact im connected to two devices or if its because my phone is just a piece of...but while im on my computer and the phone rings, when i push the button and it answers the phone, it works perfectly the way it should answering the phone and turning sound off from the computer. That being said though, i am told by those i talk to using the headset that i am sounding like a robot and shakey or they are having trouble hearing me. I have the same results though when i hear them. I also find it difficult to see the usb port where its located...I gave the headset 3 stars for the reason of the bad. I bought it both for use with my computer and my phone but when i have to select using the phone during a call and cant use the headset as intended or like i was hoping to do so that my hands could be free to continue playing a game or so that i could walk away from the phone cause its on charge it sort of defeats the purpose of why i bought the headset. Yes i also needed it for gaming nights with friends on discord and streaming music but the number one reason was for phone use.  -sighs- i guess i cant win them all.",0
3.0,Mic Doesn't Work for PC Gaming (Stereo),"October 18, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this as a replacement for an old PC gaming headset/mic. I found that when it paired with my computer (Win10), it created two Bluetooth Playback devices, but only one corresponding Recording device...Playback:. - MPOW-059 Hands-Free. - MPOW-059 Stereo..Recording:. - MPOW-059 Hands-Free..The computer can only connect to one of these devices at a time (Hands-Free or Stereo). This means that when I want to hear Stereo audio on from my computer, my default audio device has to be set to the Stereo device. That's fine, until I want to communicate with someone in a game or (weirdly) dictate to my computer, because there is no Recording device associated with it...Using the Hands-Free device as my default is not ideal. Because this device was designed for phone calls, it doesn't output stereo. To me, it was the equivalent to talking to someone on an old public payphone. Absolutely zero stereo and altogether crappy sound...Just to try, I made my Stereo device the default Playback and the Hands-Free device the default Recording device, but, because the computer only connects to one device at a time, I could hear the computer audio, but not what was being picked up by the mic...Not advised for gaming. Works fine for everything else.",2
5.0,"High Quality, Both In Sound And Structure","March 23, 2018",Yes,"I was a bit sceptical to order these (or ANY ""Bluetooth headphones"") as I only use my phone for a PHONE, and do everything on my computer, which is NOT Bluetooth enabled, and I have speakers for my music and sound.  I work in the mornings at a restaurant, and I noticed one of my managers had a headphone set on, doing his work, and jamming out.  (Before the restaurant opens, we do all the prep work, salads, etc).  I asked him about them, and he explained he left his phone in the office and could walk around with the headphones on, and hear all the music, without carrying the phone.  He let me listen and it sounded good, and like a nice idea.  SO, of course when I came home I went to Amazon, my ""go to"" place for orders, and checked out tons of reviews on various headphones, from bad reviews to great ones, and these had the most positive reviews and looked like exactly what I want.  Well, I was correct, they are fantastic!!!  Being Bluetooth challenged, I did not read the directions and could not get them to synch.  SO, I got out the directions, and pushed the button, held till the lady said ""synching"", turned Bluetooth on, on  my phone, the MP came up as an option to synch on my phone, I chose it - it accepted, I started Pandora, and my awesome music began playing on my headphones.  Great ""noise blocking"" you ONLY hear the music, and the quality is superb, nice bass, great treble, and volume, I admit, I like my R&amp;B and classic rock L O U D and this headset DELIVERS.  Thank you, Mpow!!!",0
4.0,Everyone knows what you listen to,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"This set of headphones are so sleek and flexible and EXTREMELY comfortable. So, so great! The sound is actually pretty good too, very balanced and makes some of the songs I've listened to over and over again become exciting and invigorating again. I never knew I'd been missing out on some subtle nuances from some of my favorite tracks all this time, since I've been too cheap to buy a $300-plus set online without experiencing them first hand. Hands down, these headphones sound very good...My issue with them is that if I'm listening to Queen on a bus at just a medium volume, everyone in a 10 foot radius would be able to sing along to the lyrics. I know, it sounds like a good problem to have. But seriously, the sound leakage is insane and really defeats the purpose of wearing earphones in the first place. I feel very uncomfortable wearing these out in public because even the constant ambient noise you hear in any coffee shop or gym doesn't drown out whatever you might be listening to. Everyone can hear your Bieber playlist. And they ARE judging you...If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, then buy the hell out of these. The look fantastic and are easy to pair with your devices, and despite it's flaws I don't regret buying these heaphones.",1
4.0,Pretty good for the price.,"May 17, 2018",Yes,"Try to write a quick honest review here..I’ve had these for about a week now. I work outside half the week doing mowing and other things as a building manager. I wanted something that would last all day and muffle noise from the mower..So let me say for the price these work great. Comfortable, look great and don’t fall out my ears like buds. The battery lasts me a 8 hour day easy so far. I’ve seen people huffing over having to charge them after a day but really what don’t you charge after a day of use? I like the functions and that I can move threw my songs without touching my phone. The range for me seems pretty good at least 20’ and the connections strong even with a mower running. The sound is to be expected for $37. I mean come on you didn’t expect them to be like beats,jbl,or bose did you? But for the price they pump pretty good and muffle outside sounds decently. I can hear my music very well with a motor right behind me so I’m pretty pleased. I can’t tell you the  Long Jevity of them yet but I hope they hold up..For the record I only use these with my phone wirelessly so that’s what my experience is based on..Just a quick update. Still great headphones but sadly already stopped charging. I’m a little disappointed as they are not that old and only used once a week at best. Bummer.",0
5.0,Great headphones.,"September 4, 2017",Yes,"I have only had these headphones for a couple of days now but am very impressed with them.  I purchased a cheaper set a few weeks and they were just OK.  The sound quality on this pair is much better, they fit over my ears better and are more comfortable to wear.  I have been listening to music for hours and the battery life seems to be great.  The signal is very good and they paired with my phone easily.  when powering the headphones on they connect with my paired phone faster than any Bluetooth device I have ever used.  I like the controls and the construction seems to be good quality, so that they will be durable.  The appearance and design is sleek.  There is a plush storage bag to help keep the headphones protected.  Hands free calling works well, I had no problems hearing a caller and they had no problems hearing me.  I have had several pairs of wireless headphones and these are definitely among the best.",1
5.0,A Great Budget Wireless Headset,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"Pros:.Sound quality is good but not as good as allot of other wired headsets, which honestly is to be accepted. I'm coming from a perixx ax 3000 gaming headset and I would say the perixx sounded considerably better, that being said, I would much rather use this due to the freedom and comfort you get from a wireless headset...These are very comfortable to wear, as long as you have normal sized ears you should have no problem wearing these as over ear headphones. However I've also tested them as on ear headphones, the padding is very soft and the clamping force isn't too high at all...Cons:.The microphone is pretty bad to be honest, I wouldn't recommend using them. the microphone from my old headset was way better and even the microphone on my logitech c310 webcam sounds considerably better. If you use this on a pc, like I do, I would recommend either getting a separate desktop mic or, like me, you can set your webcam mic to be default so you use that instead of the headsets mic...All in all even with the crappy mic that comes with it I would highly recommend this to anyone shopping for a budget wireless headset. The sound quality is perfectly good its just not as rich of a sound (either on the low or the high spectrum) as other good wired headsets but it is clear and for a wireless headset, considering the comfort and freedom you get with being wireless, its a damn good headset, and at this price its a bargain. Its super comfortable and fairly loud with a clean sound, I couldn't recommend it enough, just if you're going to use it on pc do yourself a favor and get a separate microphone.",1
5.0,"Great Value, Top-Notch Quality Headphones, Amazing Sound Quality, Highly Recommend","January 3, 2018",Yes,"I've always wanted Bluetooth headphones, but could never get myself to pay the hefty price for a good quality pair. To my surprise, these headphones are amazing! After reading many positive reviews, I decided to give these headphones a try. I am so glad that I did because I am blown away by the quality of these! They are collapsible, durable, a great price, come in lots of colors, and have great sound quality. The bass specifically in these headphones is impressive, and in my opinion, sound just as good as my Apple earbuds! These headphones also come with a charging cable, a headphone jack (in case you do not want to use the Bluetooth feature), and a sturdy velvet bag to carry your headphones around in. The buttons on the side are very responsive, and my music sounds absolutely great in these. I highly recommend this product!",1
4.0,"Actually, Really Solid","October 18, 2017",Yes,"I will rate these on several levels. First, as headphones. They are very good and very comfortable. I would consider them pretty flat and I mean that in a positive way. I mean that they are pretty realistic sounding and warm. I am comparing them side by side with several other headphones in the house and all dollar levels: my son's Beats, my corded Monster NTunes, my daughter's brand x headphones and I would say without question these are the most pleasant to listen to for an extended period of time. They do get a little warm on the ears after a while (an hour or so) as they are over the ear so that's pretty standard but I find them quite comfortable to wear, even with my glasses on. For certain types of music or if you like that Beats artificially boosted bass, these may not be for you unless you have an EQ to boost the bass but they sound really good for many different types of music and since they are slightly warmer and less bright compared to the Beats and others, I find I can wear them much longer without ear fatigue so I am actually listening to music while working far more, which is great. Also, from a noise limiting perspective, they are good; as are most well padded over the ear headphones...Next and why I really got them, I was looking for a good all in one jack of all trades headphone/headset combo for work and travel and am tired of earbuds. After a little trial and error I was able to get them to work in VOIP for WebEx on my laptop which is awesome for me. That and the fact that they can be wireless and wired is great. The mic only works wireless via Bluetooth but that's fine and people tell me it sounds great and they are surprised when I tell them it's Bluetooth over VOIP so that's a big win. Also, the Bluetooth range is great. If my laptop is in the middle of the house downstairs, I can travel through almost the entire house, even upstairs and not lose the connection at all...While I was troubleshooting the WebEx mic thing, I did reach out to their support team via email. While I solved the trouble without their help, and their help was pretty generic and not specific to my issue, their multiple responses were prompt. For the money, I think they are a very good product. I give it four stars because time will tell. My last Mpow earbuds had the battery stop charging after about a year so that was disappointing. Since they batteries are not replaceable, even at this price they are not something I want to be buying annually so if I can get a few years out the battery and they don't snap or fail in some other way in the coming months, I will consider them a five star purchase.",1
4.0,A good alternative to beats,"October 18, 2017",Yes,"So far so good! Offers a real alternative to more expensive headsets. Sound is good. The controls take some getting used to but I have found the Bluetooth signal to be strong and clear, and the battery to last. Longer term I will be evaluating how well this item holds up. Some other comments:..- Charging port seems to be slightly under tolerance. The cord needs to be forced in..- Carrying Pouch is nice, as are accessory cords. Also will be evaluation to see how durable they are..- The manual is in a very tiny font and for these middle aged eyes impossible to read without magnification. I can't imagine a slightly bigger font will impact product cost much..- This is probably a problem for all over the ear types, and maybe I just need to get used to it, but 10 minutes of wearing these and my ears are sweating! Yes, for real! They are well insulated for sound, but they sure keep the heat in. Maybe some cooler foams would help this...In any case, I am happy with them.",2
5.0,"Incredible sound, Excellent battery life. GET. THESE. HEADPHONES.","January 11, 2018",Yes,"So far these headphones have been insane. I’ve used them for about a day now, and they’ve been nothing but excellent. I’ve taken phone calls, listened to music (everything from current bass-heavy pop to movie soundtracks), watched a podcast, and even watched a couple YouTube videos. The audio doesn’t delay for anything and always matches the video. The battery life so far has been excellent. Out of the box I had over 10+ hours of battery life, and they charged really quickly too. If I had two complaints, it would be that the mic quality is pretty poor on these headphones, and there is a blinking blue light every 5 or so seconds on the right ear which can be annoying if you’re listening while you sleep or in the dark. Other than those two minor things, these headphones are excellent and I would highly recommend them. I have a pair of Bose over the ear headphones and Beats in-ear earbuds and though these can’t match the sound quality of the Bose or the bass of the Beats, they are an excellent mid point and the price is far far below Bose or Beats. Overall, a truly excellent headset I will be using daily..Pros: Great sound quality (Heavy bass, nice mids, good highs). Great battery life and charges quickly. Excellent aesthetic (I got the blue and black and the contrast is great and looks sharp and sleek). Good price point, very inexpensive compared to a lot of similar quality competitors..Cons: Constant blinking blue light on the right headphone. Mic quality isn’t the greatest..GET THESE HEADPHONES, YOU WON’T BE DISAPPOINTED.",2
5.0,Excellent value and performance!,"June 27, 2017",Yes,"Had it for a week now and LOVE it. I (and my family) are surprised at the sound quality. For the money it is worth every bit and more. They are comfortable and easy to use. My kids will be getting some for themselves...7/20/2017 update: Yesterday I was in the gym working on the incline bench press; I was leaning over while wearing the Mpow headphones and when I stood up my head smacked hard into the end of the weight bar. If it had hit my head I would have been hurt badly, maybe even knocked out. However, the bar hit the headphones. I thought for sure they would be cracked/broken, but when I took them off and looked at them there wasn't even a scratch! I am VERY impressed with these indeed.",2
5.0,Best for less than $100.,"October 8, 2017",Yes,"I have been through quite a few headphones in the past. Wired and wireless. Earbud, on ear, and over ear. Cheap to very expensive. These are possibly the BEST headphones I have ever bought. They last 3 days or more (at 8+ hours a day) running Bluetooth from my iPhone and they sound good without needing charging. They are not the loudest, and they do not have the highest or lowest dynamic range I have ever heard. But they sound very good and I have NO issues with them whatsoever. I would buy these same ones again in a heartbeat. And I will when they die. I recommend these for the money, and would challenge people who listen to beats to try them.",2
5.0,Cancels enough outside noise to hear on an airplane,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"I bought these to watch movies on an airplane. Earbuds were never loud enough and I needed to hear announcements and the flight attendants. The sound is terrific and there were no issues with the plug. I don't use the wireless option. The only complaint is that after an hour they start to get uncomfortable on the ears. I could get through a two-hour movie, but had to take a break after that.",2
2.0,"Sound quality is pretty good, but they're cheaply made.","November 8, 2017",Yes,"I thought I'd give these a try since there are good reviews and it's a popular over-ear bluetooth choice. They turned out not to be the right choice for me:.Pros:.- Decent sound quality.- Easy syncing.- Other parties seemed to be able to hear me well on calls..Cons:.- Every ~20 secs or so there's a skip in the audio. It's minor, but interruptive and annoying.- Volume range was not nearly as wide as I want.- Even though they are over-ear, they really don't block out much noise. I understand they aren't noise cancelling, but if better quality material was used they still be able to block out far more sound..- Heavy.- Feel fragile with all the hard plastic pieces.- Controls on headset are cheap hard plastic. Using them makes a loud clicking noise in my ear.",1
5.0,OMB do I love this Bluetooth stuff!,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"These headphones and the TaoTrobnics 20m Transmitter came yesterday (delivered on Sunday!), and do I ever love it. I did my dishes the morning listening to Peter Hill playing the Bach English Suite and it's a very big deal for me because I live in a condo with not much sound insulation, and I haven't dared do that for the last 8 years! It took some fussing around to get the transmitter and the headphones to find one another and get hitched, so to speak. But the next time I used them they were old friends. I love it, love it. No more wrestling the headphone cord. And I can use any of my electronics that has a headphone jack with them. I'm free! Why can't the Chinese spring for a real, honest to God English speaker to at least review their manuals? Good Lord. Also, you are instructed to hold a button down for two and a half seconds!",2
1.0,Didn't last 3 months,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I originally really enjoyed these headphones. I loved that they were made of a (seemingly) sturdy material. I had no issues with sound quality or battery life. At the time, my only issue was that the headphones would blink, and I had no idea why. But it wasn't that much of a nuisance. However, today I look at my headphone and realize that the fabric on the band has nearly completely come off. I only use these headphones for casual listening, typically in my room, and don't use them every single day, so there's no reason for these to have lasted not even 3 months. Waste of money.",1
4.0,Very satisfied,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"The sound on these headphones is great. It synced up with the Bluetooth feature on my computer with no problem. The volume controls are touch controlled on the outside of the ear pad on the right. Very easy to use. A USB charging cable is included as well as an audio connection cable if you need that. Comes with a neat draw-string pouch for storing. They are adjustable across the head bar. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because they are a little uncomfortable when I wear them over my glasses. After a while - like an hour or so - I get a little discomfort behind my ears. I'm a writer and will often spend hours listening to music as my muse while writing, so I'm using them almost daily. I can take my glasses off  and the discomfort resolves. I am hoping that they will loosen up a bit over time and resolve this problem on their own. If you're looking for an economical Bluetooth headset, you probably won't find much better for the price.",1
5.0,Sweet effing Greedom,"September 19, 2018",Yes,"Honestly, this might be a terrible product. I wouldn’t know better because it’s my first Bluetooth thingy, and it changed my world...In my mind, “Bluetooth” has always been a synonym for “unnecessary and dumb-looking.” But despite my technophobia, the need to binge awful 90’s sitcoms while my husband sleeps conquered all. So I bought this thingy...Again, I have no idea how good bluetooth tech is, but these headphones are way more useful than I expected them to be...Price to Product, There’s nothing left to want in sound quality. These are good for TV, to disconnect for laundry day, working the dish pit, or working out (unless you sweat 2 gal an hour, like some sort of alcoholic perimenopausal waitress, in which case get some wireless earbuds instead)...They’re not designed for professional use or sound connoisseurs, so if you wanna hear great music at great quality This Is Not Made For That...What you -can- do is pause/play, adjust volume, and you can kinda rewind and fast forward in-set if you need to, though that’s the least useful feature. The pause/play function is indescribably useful when you want to keep up the momentum of a show or movie but also have to pee or grab a water during a dialog scene...That might sounds lazy and bougie, but if you’re used to being lower-middle class or below the poverty line, this is a worthwhile indulgence for your fifty bucks. Especially if you’re on opposite schedules with your bedmate, or if you have crappy and loud window units during a typical New Orleans 6-month summer...Or whatever. I’m pretty happy with these...I’ve only had these for 2 months, but if they died tomorrow I’d still feel like I got my money’s worth.",1
5.0,"You will be blown away,..","June 21, 2017",Yes,"Dont know what people are expecting but these are great headphones.  For those that dont understand how PC headphones work, there are hardly and ""true"" 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound headphones that dont work that through ""virtual"" settings and software.  Im a avid gamer and I can say that these are just fine.  More than fine give the price.  Download Equalizer APO 1.1.2 and adjust the highs and lows and these headphone will sound as good as some of the best Ive tried.  Easy to set up, easy to use and sound great.  Im not sure what some people are expecting to hear with these but they are better than some 70 dollar headphones ive tried.",2
5.0,"Good Fit, Solid Performance, Great Price","January 28, 2018",Yes,"Been using these for two weeks, pairing them with a variety of Apple devices and a Bluetooth dongle to my TV. They are working very well...These are NOT noise-canceling, but the closed, on/over-the-ear fit blocks out a good amount of ambient noise. I wear a Large motorcycle helmet, and these headphones fit me great with the earpieces extended two notches from fully retracted. They also fit my 13-year-old son's head. The top is nicely padded, and I've worn them for up to 6 hours without discomfort. I do get a red mark on my balding head after wearing them for a couple hours or more...Sound is very good -- not audiophile quality, but these aren't $300 headphones, either. They pair readily, volume is good, and the track back/forward controls work just fine.",1
5.0,Otherwise I'm very happy with the performance and the long battery life once ...,"May 23, 2017",Yes,"While the set up instructions DEFINITELY leave much unanswered, once I fiddled around on my own how to cycle this product to charge, turn on, and connect, it works perfectly. It would have been a much nicer customer experience if I didn't have to spend so much time figuring this out. If not for that, I would have given this product five stars.  Otherwise I'm very happy with the performance and the long battery life once fully charged...UPDATE 12/20/17.  I have been using this product since I wrote this review back in May. I have worn these earphones every single day ever since. I have to say I'm super impressed with the results. The product has not degraded in any way with my constant usage.  I even frequently sleep with these headphones on with absolutely no discomfort. These headphones are easily adjustable to accommodate nearly every size head.  Nothing has worn out, it works just as well as the day I got it. So I would say this was money well spent and I'm upgrading it to five stars...I would buy these again in a heartbeat...06/25/18 Update.  I have continued to use this product every single day I have to say I am pretty impressed with how durable it is. The only (minor) problem is that the very thin coat of skin around the foam earpieces has been flaking off in itty bitty pieces for the last few months.  Otherwise, the product still functions as I would expect it to.",1
4.0,Great headset for the bucks!,"April 6, 2018",Yes,"Works great as a headset to listen to music. Overall audio quality is a B (compared to my old BeatsAudio that broke on me), but for the price I would say it's a great deal. I love that it encompasses my entire ear on both side (I got small ears) and it's doesn't feel like a vice on your head after prolong use on your head. The ear cushions feels nice. Weight on the head is decent and not too heavy, but I wouldn't wear it if I was actively moving around as it won't stay put very well. Was easy to sync with other device. It's nice that it can sync with 2 devices at once. Cables that came along with it are high quality. Headset is decently made and looks great on. As for the battery life, I made sure to let it charge all the way before my first use. Haven't had to recharge it yet and it's my 2nd day of constant use at work. It's been on and off, but mostly on. It's also great to have the wired option if you did forget to charge it. Works great both way...One major complain (at least for me) is using it on calls (wireless mode only) with my Note8. It's horrible. Incurred a lot of static and hiccups so had to revert to my regular phone headset, BUT my main purpose when I bought this is for listening to music and to drown out surrounding noises. I'm aware that it doesn't have noise canceling which I'm fine with and actually helped me realize when someone was trying to talk to me, lol. The other minor complaint is the sporadic audio hiccups when in wireless mode. I'm guessing maybe it's the frequency interruptions with all the other wireless devices here at my work. Wired mode when listening to music has been seamless...My overall experience with this has been more positive than negative. I would recommend this product to anyone.",0
5.0,"dont bother with expensive headphones, just get these instead","May 9, 2018",Yes,"Save your money! Don't bother with expensive headphones, these are basically the same thing.  I normally buy headphones in the 100$ range, but after my first pair broke due to lousy plastic and my second pair stopped pairing with my mac, I decided to try out a cheaper pair. Technology is great! These headphones offer everything my 100$ headphones used to offer at a much cheaper price...I suppose I have to wait and see if the pairing stops working, but I have had no problems so far. What I can tell you though is that these are built much more sturdily than my more expensive plastic headphones. I definitely don't see these falling apart any time soon. It would be nice if these were sound cancelling, but for good noise cancelling you have to pay ~300$. Anything lower than that and you are going to get more hiss than cancellation. The passive noise cancelling is good enough for me...Fits comfortably, I can even go jogging in these. Normally I worry about getting my expensive headphones all sweaty. But with these headphones, I can jog and listen to music or podcasts. I don't have to worry about the headphone coord getting tangled with the dog leash. Also I like that over-ear actually means over-ear. Ive had to return headphones in the past due to incorrect advertising.",0
3.0,Work decently but the flashing blue light is really distracting,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are decent headphones. The sound is not the greatest, but it's what you would expect in a low to mid-range Bluetooth set like these. It pairs easily, and I actually like the button commands once I got used to them. The drawback for this phone, in addition to it getting kind of loud for those around you when you turn up the volume, is --- as many people have stated --- the irritating blue pulsing light that shines every 7 seconds. Yes, most Bluetooth phones have this, but it's not so intrusive. The light is on one side of the phone, and encompasses the whole perimeter of the command button, which is pretty big. I was watching something on my tablet in the dark when I first tried them and the glare from the light is really distracting. I can't imagine if you wore them on a plane or bus that it wouldn't bother other people. It certainly irritated me. I, again like a lot of other people, covered it up with tape. You shouldn't really have to do this, though, which is why I gave it 3 stars only. I must have missed this fact while reading the reviews. I did check and most similar phones, and this model, don't allow you to turn the light off. Sennheiser makes a Bluetooth model that can do this, but they are a lot more expensive. I already have a pair of Sennheiser for my desktop computer (not Bluetooth), and I didn't really want to spend all that much money on this pair, which I just use with my phone and tablet. I would say if they either gave the option to turn it off (I know a lot of people like it as it let's them know the phones are still powered on) or put a small light in the BACK of the phones, it would make them a much better deal, especially for the price.",0
4.0,four stars,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"Bluetooth still connects and disconnects while on public wifi (gym) but when on data the bluetooth works very well.  I suspect it's congestion on the public wifi causing the issue as Ive noticed the very same thing recently with other bluetooth devices, so I don't think it is specific to this particular item and would likely be fine on public wifi if there was not a lot of bluetooth congestion.  I believe the device would be fine on a private wifi connection like you would have at home.  The item feels sturdy and fits comfortably on my head.  The sound quality is very good too.  I think this product is a good buy for the price and would recommend it.  Id also like to commend the company for exquisite customer service as they went above and beyond what one would expect from a company to make sure the customer was satisfied to their liking.",1
5.0,This is an amazing headphone set,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"This is an amazing headphone set.  My wife and I are getting ready for a cruise that involves a long airline trip across the Atlantic to get to the ship.  So I decided to get a good pair of headphones that were wireless, easy to use, foldable to fit in a carryon, and had decent sound.  They arrived today and they are the best I have ever used.  It paired easily with my iPhone, and the sound was amazing!  They are very comfortable even when wearing glasses, and not having to mess with a cord is great.  Plus they come with standard cord to plug into the sound for a movie on a plane.  While they are not technically active sound cancelling, they fit comfortably over the ear and close out most ambient sound.  Also, some reviews commented about how comfortable the material on the head phones feel on your ears, and they are right, it is VERY COMFORTABLE.  .",1
5.0,"First Bluetooth headphones, not disappointed.","September 24, 2018",Yes,"I was skeptical, having never used Bluetooth headphones anymore. But cheap earbuds just weren't good enough to drown out the people in my office anymore, so I decided to give it a shot. These have worked excellently for the last five or so months that I've had them, and I'm very glad with my choice. My only issue is sometimes they're not super comfortable to wear ALL day, but with short breaks they can get me through an 8 hour day at work. The battery lasts long enough that I only really need to charge every other day. Sometimes I charge them at my work station during my lunch break so that helps extend my usage time, as well. They're also sort of big, but if you're like me and don't care about looking/feeling silly, that's not much of an issue. :)..The sound quality is nice for someone like me who is not well-versed in the technical side of what qualifies as ""good"" sound. I turn them on, connect them to my phone, and I hear the things I want to hear. They're not noise canceling, but the style and fit of the headphones does block out a lot of ambient noise around me so that I don't have to turn the volume up as high to hear. I primarily listen to podcasts and videos, so it's a lot of talking, which all sounds just fine on these headphones. Music also sounds great. I try to keep the volume at a moderate level and with these headphones that's quite easy to do without having my listening experience interrupted by too much outside noise...All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase!",1
5.0,Great sound &amp; extremely comfortable headphones,"June 17, 2018",Yes,"I was in search for a pair of Bluetooth headphones for my upcoming international trip and I came across these headphones. The thing that caught my eye immediately was the color *green* because green is my favorite color. This prompted me to read the description of the headphones and other buyers reviews. After reading other buyer's reviews I was sold on purchasing these headphones. The sound quality of the headphones, in my opinion, is great, the comfort while wearing them for an extended period of time is great...I love the design of the headphones that have metal hinges and you are able to fold them up which makes them great for traveling.  You also can use these headphones as wired headphone if you wish. The headphone comes with a cloth bag very easy storage. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend them to other people.

5.0,Amazingly high quality for the low price!,"December 22, 2017",Yes,"These are a steal! Plain and simple..I've got Turtle Beach, Corsair and even Razer headphones and they were all between $50 up to about $150. Considerably more expensive...Pros:.-These are far more comfortable (given they're perfect shape for my ears, so results may vary).-Sound is crisp and clear..-very durable, soft and smooth material! Its got some weight but they rest comfortably on the top of the head.-very affordable!.-easy and quick connection through Bluetooth and aux / headphone jack..-it folds incredibly well! Making it more portable.-a pouch is included - it's also very soft and durable..-aux / headphone cable is included!.-noise cancelling! It's very difficult to hear someone with them on while nothing is playing. I can see these being quite useful at times...Cons:.-the bass is a bit low (?)... However, it could possibly be corrected with an equalizer...Edit 1: There may or may not be more but I wanted to do an update after a few days of consistent use. Here are a few things I've noticed about this particular headset:..-the audio cord is pretty cheap, I don't expect it to last long. It's not a big deal but it's something to keep in mind..-the microphone isn't that great. So it's not a good replacement for a gaming headset nor for streamers or anyone who expects to have a decent conversation with you. Still 5 star because of the affordability",1
2.0,Works well when wired and over bluetooth. Build quality ...,"June 29, 2018",Yes,"Works well when wired and over bluetooth. Build quality cheap (ugly shiny plastic). My biggest gripe is the flashing blue light over bluetooth. When connected to bluetooth, a blue LED will shine from one of the sides every few seconds. It stands out a lot and there is no way to disable it except for disconnecting from bluetooth. If I had known about this before, I wouldn't have purchased these headphones...EDIT: I forgot to mention that the microphone is atrocious. I've tried answering calls while outside. Just the slightest breeze will drown out the sound for the person on the other end.",2

The batteries last very well, better than any other device I have.  I plug them in during the day maybe every 2 or 3 weeks...The sound quality is good, better than another Bluetooth headset I bought a year earlier and cost 3 times as much.  I use it mostly to watch TV on my tablet at night and the quality is very good for what I use it for.  Not a lot of bass though, but enough for me (barely ;)  They cancel noise pretty well and I have not had problems with external noise when watching TV or listening to music on Pandora...The headset is very comfortable for me and I have no problems with having it on for hours at the time.  It fits comfortably over my head and around my ears and I don't sweat under them.

Sound quality is great.  Have even tried them with my Samsung phone in the car while husband is driving (of course).....again, great sound. We have a 2300 square foot home, and I can wear these all over the house still connected and great sound. They connected easily to all devices (tv, iPad, phone). No delay when viewing TV or video. Ear fits within the cushions of the headset which are very roomy and soft.  I have worn them for about 2 hours without head or ears hurting. You can still hear around you with these on, but the sound level is very soft. I like the controls on the side, does take a bit getting use to.  Instruction book is not really helpful for the controls.  It is sorta trial and error in figuring out if the headset is on or off, paired or connected. Just a new toy and you have to get use to it.

If you're not an audio snob, but you really want a quality pair of headphones, then you'll like these. They fit great on my head and the cushions feel nice. The band adjusts. They come folded and in a little carrying pouch, which I thought was a nice touch. The controls are easy to use. They do talk to you though, when they turn on/off or when they are pairing. As in, the headphones will say ""Power On"" or ""Pairing"" or ""Power Off"". So that's an interesting detail that I didn't realize before I bought them. However, I don't really mind. These are great and I LOVE that I can dance/jump rope/jog without having to worry about a cable connecting my phone to my headphones. Plus, they look really cool. :)",1
4.0,"if they do not work, maybe $5 will (or ask a friend)","January 28, 2018",Yes,"I had a problem with these being comfortable. When I contacted the seller, instead of offering to swap them out for another pair, they offered me $5 just to keep them. Nice offer but it would not have made them more comfortable. I returned them.. UPDATE: After placing the review above I was contacted by the maker of this brand with a request to look at their product again. I explained that since I have already gotten a full refund from Amazon, I do not feel comfortable with getting a free set of headphones (which they offered) just to give a favorable review. However, if they wanted to provide another set I would give them to a friend for free and ask him to review them. That is what I did.. According to him, he is very satisfied with the product. He found them to be comfortable with a fully acceptable sound quality. Especially so for something in this price point. I take that to mean that while they may not compete with something like Bo$e neither do they cost ten times as much as these do. The only complaint he mentioned was the control buttons (which I had no problems with). While I am not an electronics junkie, he certainly is. His final opinion is that he would give these a 4-5 star. Based on that I have changed my personal 2 star to his 4 star.",0
5.0,"Love These - Pretty Color, Good Sound","April 10, 2018",Yes,"I'd love to have a second pair of these. They're so much more comfortable than the various earbuds I've tried (in-ear, over the ear, whatever... they all stick into your ear). I love the pink color. That was what helped me arrive at these. Most headphones are black, grey, red, and sometimes blue. Usually only children's headphones are pink...I mostly watch TV with these, so I can't give any specific comments on how good they are with loud music. The few times I did listen to music with them, I was happy with the sound, but I'm not an audiophile...It took me a little while to figure out how to disconnect the Bluetooth connection from one device so I could connect to another, but I finally figured it out (just press the button until it disconnects.) Some devices will let me have two connected at the same time, but not all of them...All in all, these are great headphones. If they didn't cost $40, I would have already purchased another pair.

5.0,Better sound and fit than Beats,"September 11, 2018",Yes,"This is my third pair of Bluetooth headphones from this company. These are the first that are over ear rather than the buds that hook over your ear. They have a great battery life, I’ve walked the dog for a total of nearly 4 hours and still more than half the battery life...As far as sound quality, I got these for winter to replace my over ear Beats brand. They sound better, cancel noise better, and get louder without fuzzy feedback. I like the look of my beats, but other than that these are a bit bigger, I like them better. They are still cute and never pinch my head or ears. I’ve also knocked my heavy umbrella into them quite a few times in the wind and they haven’t scuffed at all.",1
4.0,Wear Until You’re Ready to Trade Up,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"Great sound quality- easy to drown out background noise, though if the volume is at a certain level or the headset is misaligned slightly other people may hear your music. Overall, all the padding gives it a nice cushy/cozy feel. However, less than four months in and there is a slight odor to the headset that other reviewers warned can happen from frequent use, so I would recommend trying to lightly clean it maybe? I don’t use mine to workout so it didn’t occur to me to do this but apparently these things need a wipe down no matter how you use them to avoid funk. Also the padding up top has completely come off, which I chalk up to cheap materials, though the basic machinery still works. I wasn’t expecting greatness but I did expect better for $40. Most likely I’ll wear them until I’ve got the money to trade up and maybe that’s all they’re good for anyway...UPDATE: So I just got a new pair of MPOW's that the lovely people at customer services were kind enough to send me. I'll be treating this pair with a little more TLC this time around too, just in case that was a factor with the last pair! :)",0
2.0,Decent but far from high fidelity,"August 15, 2018",Yes,"I’m no audiophile but I can tell the difference in a good set of headphones. For reference, I was coming from mostly using the standard Apple headphones. These work, the Bluetooth connects well, and the range isn’t bad letting me wander around the house while my phone stays charging...However, the sound is pretty flat. Yes you can hear bass but this is far from an immersive music experience I expected. I would rank them slightly above Apple’s standard set of earbuds, but the heaviness totally outweighs that benefit. You can hear the TV when I have these on and volume is below 75%. Sure if you like listening at or near max volume then these will be just as good as any other set of headphones, but if you want some high fidelity noise cancelling headphones look at spending $60-80 instead and you’ll be much more pleased with the end experience...I wouldn’t want to take these on an airplane or anywhere else if I truly want noise cancelling ability",0
5.0,One of the best products I've ever bought!,"June 12, 2017",Yes,I cannot believe how good these work for the price!  My friend has the wireless beats and to be honest I can't tell the difference short of the fact that I saved over $200 on mine compared to his.  I use these to watch movies on my iPad and listen to music on the airplane.  They look cool they fold up nice I have to laugh at people that spend more than $50 on headphones.  If for whatever reason these break or I lose them I am only out $30 if I were to buy a set of $300 beats and I lost those oh boy would I be upset.,3
5.0,Support made things right,"April 16, 2018",Yes,"Update: 5/6/18:..Support has been in contact with me and has sent me a new set of headphones without no questions asked and the new pair works great and I am extremely happy...Previous Review:..There are certainly some pros to these headphones. The price is right, the sound quality is good, the Bluetooth is good, the battery lasts for days, they fit my big head without falling apart. Really everything you could want in headphones...The problem is, they are controlled entirely by a rocker switch, it rocks different ways to control them. First of that is a dumb design, why not just have individual buttons, but the real problem is it doesn't work very well. Powering these on ends up taking several minutes to get the rocker switch to the correct location. That just kills me wanting to use them.  I would not recommend these simply because of how bad the design is...Yes I contacted their support, but they are either unable to understand the problem due to a clear language barrier or they just can't read what I am saying, in any rate they are completely unhelpful.",0
4.0,high quality and comfortable,"August 30, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are great headphones.  They are very comfortable and the sound quality is more than adequate.  I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but they sound great in my opinion.  I've had one issue so far where the headphones stopped connecting to my devices.  The light would blink as if it was in pairing mode, but there was no audio cue that they were in pairing mode, and I could not connect to them with my phone of tablet.  I reached out to the manufacturer and was given the instructions to perform a factory reset.  The reset didn't work, but when I told the paired devices to forget this bluetooth device, it started working again.  Being able to use them with a standard audio plug is quite handy too; extends the options for use and I will be taking these with me on an airplane in the future.  I would recommend them, especially for the price.  They look nice and fold up compact to fit in the supplied carrying case.",0
5.0,For around $37 u get a headset with excellent treble and bass and an excellent microphone,"July 26, 2017",Yes,If there were a 6 star rating I would give this headset 6 stars. For around $37 u get a headset with excellent treble and bass and an excellent microphone. I use it to mow the grass and I barely hear the lawn mower playing and I don't have to blast the volume so the noise cancelling is excellent. It is also very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It takes me about an hour and a half to mow and it just starts to feel a little uncomfortable after that.  Excellent controls on the right ear piece. I can honestly not think of a single thing that I would improve on this headset. Worth way more than $40.  Buy it u won't regret it!,2
4.0,Great wireless headphones at a good price,"August 16, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones for the price. Connects easily and the audio is crisp and clear. I love the fact that you can also plug a 3.5mm cable to it if the battery dies and it'll just power up from your device like wired headphones do. Very comfortable on the ears and quite light. It appears they're solid enough to last a few years without falling apart. The controls on the right-ear side are easy to get to and very responsive. I get asked about them all the time...I gave it 4/5; I would have liked these to have a little more bass response and also be a bit louder. The noise canceling is great but they're not as loud as I would have liked. I don't know the decibel range but I suppose another 5db of volume would suffice if I had to suggest an improvement. All in all, great headphones for this price point.",1
5.0,Great so far!,"January 3, 2018",Yes,"Great so far! I was so excited about them and satisfied that I wanted to review them right away...Packaging: protective.Price: more expensive than basic ear buds, but worth the price!.Sound: clear, no fuzzy or static. Silences background noise in the gym for an example..Fit: comfortable and adjustable.Glasses: works with mine. Keeps them in place..Movement: head banging makes it move, but as a gym rat, they stay in place for deadlifts, jumping, etc.",3
5.0,All around high quality.,"August 4, 2018",Yes,I’ve hand these headphones for about 6 months now and they still have a good battery life and they work perfectly well. The range on the connection is pretty crazy as well. There’s been a couple times when I took them off after I got back from the gym and forgot to manually disconnect them and when I went downstairs to my room I couldn’t figure out why sound wasn’t playing for a moment. Then I realized that it was still connected from a floor up almost 30 ft away. The sound quality is also extremely good for the price. They may not be studio quality but for 30 bucks they’re easily the best headphones I’ve had.,1
5.0,I needed an economical set for my son so he can beat the crap out of them without breaking the bank,"August 22, 2018",Yes,"I am very picky with headphones. I evaluate specs in paper vs how the really sound, fit, built and cost. I needed an economical set for my son so he can beat the crap out of them without breaking the bank. I said to myself. ""Well they might not be as good as some other more expensive models"", but I was wrong. I am amazed with these...These headsets have the ability to work wired or wireless which is a big plus. In wireless mode (Bluetooth), the battery last pretty much what they advertise and the phone, track and volume control and microphone works amazing. Also they very easy to pair. In wired just plug the 3.5mm cable in to the outlet and done. They are very comfortable and not as heavy as they look. What I do not like is that the outer side of the headband is a finger print magnet...Don't get me wrong, for answering a phone call and then listen some music or playing a game you can't go wrong.",0
5.0,"Don’t hesitate, click add to cart! You won’t be disappointed!","October 5, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones, quite honestly didn’t believe they’d be for the low price! I bought them for my 10yo son, he uses them mostly for his tv and they hook up easily to his Apple TV and then when he chooses they seemlessly hook to his phone. He says they even pause/play his Apple TV as well as control it as well. My sons says he feels as if he’s in the shows lol; without a doubt this is a Great Buy!",10
5.0,Pretty good,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"Pro: I use these in a noisy factory environment and i can hear them well. they occasionally have a minor issue with Bluetooth connectivity but that may be more my phone than the headset..Cons: -You will need to likely use your equalizer to get the audio to sound correct to you because they have a little too much base and top end but the mid levels seem to disappear if your listening to podcasts or audio books..-There really needs to be some sort of indicators on the buttons, raised sections, bumps, or something as all 5 of the buttons are flat and can be difficult to figure out till you get used to it..-there are no indicators when buttons are pushed, no beeps or words or anything so it may be difficult to know whats going on without pausing a second to hear whats happening..Overall they work well, are holding up, and i would likely buy again.",0
4.0,Very good device.,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"Recently purchased this for my father to help with his hearing issues. Not just so he doesn't have to crank up the volume on things until the neighbors can hear it, but so that he can catch more nuanced and subtle sounds that high volume mask. Have found the headphones easy to set up and use, with only one exception that being the presence of a second device that it's tethered to can sometimes take over. I've found the easiest fix for this is to simply turn off blue tooth on the device I'm not using (such as having a tablet in the same room as a computer, when the tablet is used turning travel and the computer for home). My father is exceptionally pleased with the device and it's long battery life and short charge time...One recommendation I would wish for in the future is that the device be able to play while being charged. Also having it signal ""device one, two..etc.."" instead of ""phone one..etc.."" would help with some confusion.",1
5.0,Absolutely love the Mpow H2!!!,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"Not sound canceling at all, uncomfortable to wear and the sound isn't crisp.  Had them turned up to max, and it was still hard to hear.  My cell Bluetooth is better...Update:  The Mpow H2 are awesome!!!  They fit over your ears instead of on your ears.  My ears didnt ache wgile wearing them or after taking them off.  The sound is crisp and clear.  I walked over 30 feet away from both my ipad and cell phone.  I tried a movie on the ipad, and a call on my cell.  There was no interference whatsoever.  I would definitely recommend these to everyone that likes over the ear bluetooth.  The customer service is outstanding!! They wrote me back, provided a replacement and made sure I was happy. Good company to have on Amazon",1
3.0,"Works in a pinch, but not quality","September 25, 2018",Yes,"I intended this as a cheap travel headset so I was prepared for mediocre sound so long as the mic worked decently. 4 stars on both fronts, no complaints bc I got what I paid for...Giving this 3 stars though for the tight fit - it gives me a pressure headache within 2 hours, and just generally does not feel gentle on the head. I have a medium-large head and specifically search for comfortable sets, and some of the reviews below endorsed this set's comfort. Not for me, oh well...Also the ear cups get too warm, doesn't feel like they can breathe.",1
5.0,"So comfortable, ears actually fit inside","November 15, 2017",Yes,"I've been using these for a couple months now..They are so comfortable! I have sort of large ears and these are the first headphones that don't crush them or press on them, My ears fit inside and there is enough room that there is no pressure on my ears. I can and do wear them for hours without discomfort..The Bluetooth connects easily and the audio is clear and clean - no static..They really do go for hours without recharging..The only issues are minor. The storage bag is a tight fit but i have a larger bag from previous headphones that works fine..The cable to connect for charging is short but it uses the same common connectors as my longer, Samsung phone charging cable so i just use that one..I am very happy with these headphones.",1
5.0,Very nice bluetooth headphones for voice and more,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"I use these primarily for listening to podcasts and lectures and for talking on the phone.  In my opinion, the voice clarity is very good, and the microphone appears to work quite well too, as I have not had any comments about not being understood by anyone I've called.  It's a little odd talking on the phone, because you'll barely hear your own voice through the passive insulation.  However, you do get used to this.  The battery life has been quite good, although I haven't run it more than 7-8 hours without charging.  The range of the bluetooth seems to be at least as good as advertised.  They fold nicely for travel.  The headset is soft and comfortable, and it keeps my ears warm but not sweaty.  Sometimes I'll wear them when turned off, just to dampen nearby TV, music, or conversations when I'm reading or working.  I'll never go back to earbuds!  I have not done extensive comparison to other headphones for listening to music.",1
4.0,better than beats,"October 8, 2017",Yes,"about a year ago I purchased the beats studio 2.0. Returned in less than a week could not deal with the over priced/rated headphones. This does sound like static on standby but then stops with in seconds unlike the beats which you hear static the whole time during standby/ waiting for music/sound.  Doesn't feel uncomfortable, until a longtime you are going to feel a little sweaty but not right away like the beats, noise canceling is okay, it does get loud enough to make you want to sing without hearing yourself and foldable. others could tell what you are listening to if put really loud near max volume clearly. Picture on amazon makes it look a little brighter &amp; glossier but not that obvious. Voice interrupts music saying max volume, tight enough only if running straight, loosens if you sharply stop or turn. battery good haven't fully test since I share. but u buy what you pay for",1
5.0,Outstanding Customer Service,"May 23, 2018",Yes,"So I wrote a review before about it cracking while putting it on and the discoloring on the grey and the people at MPOW read it.  Woke up and was shocked.  Saw an email from MPOW offering to send me a new pair.  They did that without even me asking for one.  Goes to show that they do pay attention to their customers and is willing to take care of them.  That's what I call real customer service.  I only wish more companies would do what they do and stand by their products and make sure their customers are satisfy, I know I am.  My review was a 3 star earlier, but after how they handled my complaint, it clearly warrants them FIVE STARS easily.  I have 3 of their products before they sent me a free pair of 059, and they all work well, comfortable, and sounds great for the money.  After I finish writing this review, I'm going to purchase some more of their products, an AUX adapter for my car (since yesterday, the laws here became hands free only or it's a $100 ticket) and a Bluetooth adapter for my PC.",0
5.0,"A little snug at first, but then a perfect fit.","April 12, 2018",Yes,"I wanted to use them for a bit before posting a review.  When I first tried to wear them they were too tight for my head and I couldn't wear them for more than a few minutes. So as a solution I placed them on (literally on, like it was wearing them) my computer chair for a couple of days to stretch them out just a tad. After that a perfectly comfortable fit...I love how long the battery lasts and that I can switch to corded when the battery dies. I did have my own silly mishap when I first got them as I forgot they were still linked and tried to make a call that I thought wasn't ""going through"" only to embarrassingly realize that it was going through just fine it was just trying to use my headphones for the communication.(they were sitting on the counter.) Which I've now gotten the hang of...I love the control buttons on the headphones themselves and how there aren't too many buttons. I've worked out with these on and they stay on just fine which is why I got them to begin with. Overall I'm really impressed with them.",0
5.0,Great headphones at a bargin!,"June 27, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these headphones a little over two months ago for the sole purpose of I wanted a set of headphones to use while I work out. For the price these are some great headphones, they are loud, and pack some bass, comfortable to wear.  Battery life is amazing  as well, and I just throw it on the charger every two weeks just cause. I workout 4 times a week at 1-1.5 hours a day...If I had to pick one negative is the mic is really weak so don't expect to use this as a headset talking on on the phone. This is a non issue for me as I didn't purchase these with that expectation.",4
5.0,Great headphones!,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"I got these to bring to work to replace my wired headphone which were constantly getting tangled up in everything.  They connected easily to my cheapo $200 Windows 10 computer and literally effortlessly to my expensive iPhone, (when I say effortlessly, I mean ithey found and connected to my phone without my doing anything)  I know this because there’s a pleasant little voice prompt that tells me when the headphones are on and what they’ve connected to.  And - surprise to me because I don’t read descriptions - there’s a mic in there too so when I am working and someone calls me I can take the call without picking up or even knowing where my phone is because they’re connected to both my phone and my computer!  (Will wonders never cease?)..My friend at work returned hers because she found that, while they were comfortable and good quality, she had trouble connecting and disconnecting her $2,000 computer between these and the headphones she used in her home office.  Could be user error, could be something else...They are super comfortable - way more comfortable than the Beats I have at home, which are made for people with dainty princess heads and teeny little pixie ears.  I am a normal sized person with normal ears and a normal head and my Beats get uncomfortable for me after a while because the ear pads are so small and the head band rests right on top of my head.  The Mpows are a little heavy, but not nearly as heavy as they look.  I wouldn’t jog on the treadmill with these because they’re a little big for that, but I do with my Beats because at that price they should be able to withstand some ear sweat; am I right?!?!..At a tenth of the price of my Beats I was able to buy a pair of these for each of my two kids and still have hundreds of dollars in my pocket.  My kids love them.  And, even though they aren’t technically noise canceling, because they cover the ear completely I have to yell at my topmost mommy volume to get the kids to hear me when they’re wearing them.  And they were able to choose the color they wanted - and of course they both chose the same color, so there you go...And they sound just as good as my Beats...I would highly recommend them.",0
3.0,Disappointed: there's an annoying noise that comes on and off when connected through Bluetooth,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"--- update 9/8/2018 ---..Raising the rating by one star because of good customer service...After leaving my initial review, I was contacted by customer service. They sent me an replacement (Mpow H2) for me to try. My original complaint was about sound quality. H2, in my opinion, indeed has better sound, but it's not nearly as comfortable as 059. I can't really recommend either. But again, there are budget headphones. Maybe I'm asking too much for this price range. I supposed this pair could be decent enough for a budget-oriented consumer...--- original review ---..Initially, I purchased another pair of headphones on Amazon for less than half of what the Mpow costs. That other pair has OK sound but it's very uncomfortable and gets irritating very quickly. So I returned that pair and purchased Mpow instead based on the reviews...As it turns out, Mpow is indeed quite comfortable which is a big plus. However, the sound quality is not good. What's particularly annoying is the fuzzy noise that comes on and off when it's connected through Bluetooth. If connected through the cable, the sound quality gets a lot better and the noise won't be there. But let's be real, I didn't buy these wireless headphones so that I can use them with wire. In fact, some other reviewers have also reported similar issues with the noise so I'm guess it's quite a common problem...Ultimately, headphones are about the sound. If the sound isn't great, you wouldn't want to use it no matter how comfortable they fit on your head. Disappointed.",0
3.0,Good battery life,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"**Edit 11/29/2018.Since my original posting, the company reached out to me and sent me a replacement product, the Mpow H1 model, and so far I'm really enjoying it. Compared to the Mpow 059 model, the H1 line is: lighter, more comfortable, better build, and noise cancellation..The sound is pretty similar best I can tell, but the comfort of the H1 model makes the extra $10 in price worth it. My opinion below remains true for the Mpow 059, but I would highly recommend giving the Mpow H1's a chance...The first thing that surprised me about these headphones was with how big they are! The ears stick out from my head close to 2 inches per side. Like surely they don't need to be that huge. Another negative is they aren't as comfortable as I would have hoped from headphones. After wearing them for 20-30 minutes, I start to get a slight headache every time. Also I noticed that they don't block any sound out and in fact, at times they seem to AMPLIFY the background noise..The sound itself is pretty decent with a decent range of bass and treble. But again, without the background noise canceling, the sound can get a little muddy. Would I buy the 059's again? No, probably not",1
2.0,Not good enough,"July 22, 2017",Yes,"Given my usage of headsets with my phone, listening to music whenever and wherever, I figured it was time to cave and get something wireless. A Bluetooth headset would serve my purposes better and all that...Pros:.- Comfortable, assuming you have an average head and ear size. If not they'll have a more on-ear feel..- Seemingly durable. A good amount of metal for hinges instead of all plastic and won't let you fold them if you have the length pulled out, which seemed highly practical. (But I won't be time testing them.).- Easy to use. Honestly, just read the manual and you're good...The Con:.Well, the sound quality is god awful, and that's what it really came down to for me. I sat listening to music for a good while, debating whether or not it was intolerable enough to want to go through a return. It is..For examples of sound quality I'm used to, I long-time favored the HD 202 II Sennheiser model, that unfortunately hasn't been available to buy in the past four months. Might have discontinued? But I digress..Favored the model for comfort and sound quality, along with the great price. (Sat between $24 and $30, depending on markdowns.) While there are certainly better headsets out there, what it sported was quality none the less...So yeah, this headset? Which normally sits at $70? Nah, horrible sound quality. Maybe if the reg price was lower it'd be excusable, but it's not, so it isn't. Returning immediately.",0
5.0,"Worked well, then didn’t work at all","March 9, 2018",Yes,"These headphones were great until they stopped working about a month after I got them. I emailed customer service a week ago, and have yet to hear a reply. The just stopped connecting to any device that I have (iPhone 6 plus and iPad Pro were my main uses). I know how to connect them, since I used them happily for a month, but now when they flash, they just don’t connect. I go into my Bluetooth settings and try to select them, and they still won’t connect. My devices state that the device is not available. I hate leaving bad reviews because I know everyone’s experience is different, but I’m not sure what else to do since the company is unreachable...UPDATE: After leaving the above review (1 star) I was emailed by Mpow and told that I would receive a replacement, which I did in about a week.  The new headphones are working great. I'll leave another update if there are any issues in the future, but for now I'm very happy with the replacement.",1
4.0,Bluetooth Bliss,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"I really like these headphones. They work perfectly for me so far and the range is really good. I can pretty much walk everywhere in my house, and a little distance outside before the connection is lost. The mic functions well for me too when using it during phone calls. I’ve had them for a week now and have been using them every night while I sleep, and I’m just now having to recharge them today. That seems like pretty good battery life to me. I plan on taking them to the gym with me as well so I’ll see how they function with all the moving around...One thing I noticed is that a few reviews have said that you can’t turn the headphones off, but you definitely can. It says how right in the little manual. I turn them off whenever I don’t plan to use them for an extended period of time. That has probably added to my battery life...I read that a few people have had some issues, so I went ahead and purchased the Squaretrade Insurance that was offered with them. It was really cheap and better safe than sorry. I do wish that they included and actual plug with this instead of just a charging cord but other than that I have no complaints so far.",0
2.0,"Great wireless headphones, awful mic quality, only 1 sound at a time","January 3, 2018",Yes,"Sadly, I'm disappointed after buying 2 sets. I gifted one to my brother and was told the sound quality was great and the Bluetooth was very convenient. After purchasing one for myself, I used it for a couple days and loved the sound quality. However, after calling my brother we both agreed that the microphones were not good. Ringing sounds, metallic/tingy, and overall quality reminds me of a walkie talkie. In addition to the fact that neither of us can listen to more than 1 source of sound at a time! For example, I can not listen to spotify and a game at the same time. Very frustrating considering I bought these headphones to play games online with my brother, but we can't have the sound of the game and voice at the same time...Pros: Comfortable and great sound quality.Cons: Microphone sounds terrible",1
5.0,A perfect gift!,"June 29, 2018",Yes,"My daughter wanted a Bluetooth Headset similar to my Sony headphone.  This one is great.  It paired instantly, feels comfortable, and has great sound quality.  For 40$ plus a 40 hour battery life this item is AMAZING!  I paid 60$ for a refurbished Sony Bluetooth headphones set, but this is just as great.  The earphones are comfortable, and have great quality.  The Sony headphones I purchased were lower due to being refurbished, but these are equally on par with quality, sound, and style.  But so far these seem more durable.  If you are considering purchasing these, they are the best purchase for Bluetooth headphones!",1
5.0,Great noise canceling headphones,"September 9, 2018",Yes,"I initially bought theses for my son to use at school. He is pretty easily distracted and I thought these might be helpful. I tested them at home and loved them so much I decided to keep them. I paired it with my work computer and have even used them for video calls. The built in microphone works great. I work from home and have a large family (including 2 kids under 2) so these come in handy when I have to get some work done and don’t want to be distracted. (Of course, there is another adult with the kids). :) I also got the MPOW 071 usb headset for video calls because I thought these looked a bit bulky on video calls. The noise canceling isn’t as great as it is on these on those but that still block out a lot of external noise and is a lot more sleek. They are also not wireless though. These have the option to be both wired and wireless. I’ll probably let my son have them at some point - or I’ll by another pair.",0
5.0,"~The future is now, and it has Bluetooth","November 14, 2018",Yes,"I originally got these because I got my diath pierced on the inside of my ear and I couldn’t wear my normal earphones anymore..1- they’re really comfy and don’t give me headaches, and I wear them all day at work.2- I use the controls on the side allllll the time. Very handy. Just wish they wouldn’t make such a loud click when I push them..3- sound quality is A+. I can drown out 50+ people talking while I’m working and it really helps me focus better..4- being Bluetooth and not having to be hooked up to my phone is wayyy more convenient than you’d think. Aka I can still listen to my music while I’m working and my phone can charge like 15 ft away. And there’s no cord tangling and getting in my way. I only say this because, I kept forgetting these headphones at home so I’d have to use my old earbuds that came with my iPhone and the cord was just super annoying and the earbuds hurt my ears and kept falling out. I felt like I was cheating on the good headphones with subpar garbage earbuds...TLDR; These are good, you should buy like 5 of them.",0
4.0,"It works pretty well, but not perfect","December 4, 2018",Yes,This is my first time with wireless headphone.  I like to listen to music while I clean house and my teenagers don't like my music.  Can you imagine such a thing?  When I used an MPs player the wire was in the way as I moved around and I would rather listen to a larger variety on Youtube.  I hoped these would have good enough range to cover the house and they mostly do.  I can get to the washroom before it starts losing the signal.  But the music often hesitates.  It's not a smooth flow even when I'm close to the computer.  I also hoped to use this when I watch TV while working out.  But the sound is always late and it's harder to follow what's going on.  I didn't notice any problems when I was using them for text into speech on my kindle for pc so I could listen to books while I did other things.,0
4.0,So far so good. Bluetooth was very easy to set up on ...,"January 8, 2018",Yes,"I just received these today. So far so good. Bluetooth was very easy to set up on iPhone.My daughter has a Beats set and the sound is nothing like Beats quality but....The sound quality is pretty good, not too much bass, not too much treble. Comfort is good, they fit over your entire ear. They seem very sturdy and easy to adjust on your head, they are cool looking. I bought the green ones. For the price you cannot pass it up. If you are looking for an inexpensive Bluetooth headset for yourself or your kids, these will do the job perfectly. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars (I would of given 4.5 stars) is because you can hear the music still from the outside. I put them on and had my daughter stand next to me, about 5 feet away. She can hear the music clearly and I had the volume only half way. The purpose of headphones is to make sure no one around you can hear the music.",1
5.0,Really surprised,"February 26, 2018",Yes,Opened the box and first impression was for the price no way??? They seem well made and don't seem cheap.  Screws are seen holding thing together with metal retractable inserts for head phones. Nice cushion ear peice and top band. Charged them up as it recommend. Synced to phone no problems. WOW!! They are nice and clear very loud. There not bass minded but for me they are really nice and I think they sound pretty good.  I made a couple of calls and no issue with hear or the caller saying man are you in the other room can't hear you???  Not the case.  Overall for the price point I'd recommend these all day long.  They just seem more but you paid less compairing to the high end stuff.  I just wanted something I can pair to my phone tablet or PC that have good battery life and sound half way decent. Are they the best no. At the price point and what you get they are a steal.  Plus all the controls on the head set actually work! Unlike other El cheapo units..Update bought a second set these things rock!!!! Wife wanted a pair after trying mine out,0
5.0,Incredible Wireless Headphones for the Price,"May 17, 2018",Yes,"My wife and I have been looking for over the ear headphones that at least passively noise cancelling for quite awhile. We had looked at these Mpow headphones for a few months and recently just went for it with both of us buying a pair. They are awesome, especially given the price. I've never used Beats or Bose headphones, which I'm sure are better, but for less than $40, I don't think there is anything better than these Mpows...They are easy to use, the Bluetooth range is as advertised, and the sound is great. I've been using them nearly everyday for almost a week now and the battery level is above 75 percent still. They are comfortable and fit nicely over my ears, even when I am wearing glasses. They fold up nice and compact and come with a carry bag to protect the headphones and to store the charging cable and auxiliary cable...We cannot recommend these enough and will likely buy them again unless something drastic happens.",0
3.0,If you want cheap this is it.,"September 16, 2018",Yes,"I bought this and when i got it it worked perfectly for a couple of hours then the sound quality and voice quality faded. It would unpair and not reconnect, then randomly drop connection. I sent an email to the company and they did a wonderful job responding to me and sending a replacement unit, they sent it quickly and hassle free. So the customer service is actually amazing. But the Quality of this headset is just terrible in my opinion. I gave it 3 stars because it IS a comfortable headset and the customer service is pristine. It was just a hassle for me.",1
5.0,"Great quality, battery seems to last forever and bluetooth range is awesome","January 5, 2018",Yes,"I bought these a week ago and they have a lot of things I like about them, The bass wasn’t what I had pictured but the quality of the sound is amazing, the range I’ve got is about 50 feet consistently before it starts breaking up, wayyy more than reasonable. The battery? I’m not sure the exact time but I know I binged 3 seasons of narcos in 4 days and it never died. The quality of the padding is unreal and I never once had to take these headphones off because my ears were uncomfortable. 6 hours straight once. The noise cancellation is amazing and I use them when I’m at the shooting range as well. I don’t know how the microphone is I haven’t tried it yet but I’ll update this review as soon as I do. For now? I’d buy this again in a heartbeat and put it up any Bose or Beats I’ve had with the price any day. If you’re a baller on a budget like me I’d recommend these!",1
5.0,"A pair of headphones that are a great value, great sound and very comfortable to wear.","February 28, 2018",Yes,"I was looking for a new set of headphones to replace my 7year old Phillips ""cover the ear"" headphones and I found them with these Mpow 059's!!  The sounds is great and I couldn't be happier!.I'm not a firm believer in bluetooth so can't offer any comments on that part of the headphones but glad I have the capability to use them with the included 3.5mm cord..In my opinion they are very ""sound proof"" to the world outside which was an added bonus for me.  They don't block out 100% of the sound, but if I were to put a percentage on how much it blocks out, I'd say it's about 50% blocked and all other sounds are significantly lowered to a very incoherent muffle..For me, my ears are not large or small, just ""average"" size and these headphones fit very comfortably around them which is exactly what I wanted.  I I've had them on all afternoon and never experienced any discomfort from wearing them. that long..All in all a great pair of headphones.  I'm contemplating another pair to use while I'm working out.  At this price, why not?",0
5.0,One Hour Out of the Box Quick Review - All is Well with these headphones.,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"I ordered these headphones from Amazon Prime yesterday after reading a review on the website BGR.com.  They had a $7.00 discount code  for the already low price of $34.99.  (The discount code was very popular, and has now expired. You won’t miss that $7 if you order these for the normal price, though.)..With so many positive reviews, I figured it was a no-brainer, especially with $7 off an already low price...I got one day delivery - They were waiting when I got home tonight.  Quick set-up.  Had them connected to my phone in a minute.  Included in the packaging is a USB charging cable, a mini jack for corded connection to another device, a tiny little start-up guide and and nice little storage bag.  These headphones fold up for storage and claim a battery life of 20 hours.  They also have a built-in microphone for taking phone calls.  I haven’t tried the mic yet...I’ll be keeping these.  I will keep the box and packaging until I can’t return them if there is a quality issue...I listen to a lot of country, and I am really, really happy with the sound on the stuff I’ve listened to so far.  Mid range is a little scooped, but, oh well......I spent $30 for some great headphones for my intended use..I have some more expensive headphones - they cost a lot more - but they’re not bluetooth, and I’m not taking them out side, which is where the MPOW’s I just got today will be...I plan on using these while I’m out in the yard mowing.  Maybe for watching TV without waking her up......Score - 5 Thumbs Up",0
5.0,The positive reviews are right - great blue-tooth head phones!!,"January 7, 2018",Yes,"I am really impressed at the craftsmanship of these headphones! With all the cheap junk I’ve gotten from amazon in the past - I was worried but the positive reviews inspired the risk taken to purchase these!..They are no brand but whoever made these made em well!..Pro:.Bluetooth link up is easy, volume and sound quality are excellent, they look exactly as pictured, came with a lil pouch for easy travel..Con:.They’re kinda tight for me. I eventually start feeling like I’m getting a headache at the base of my skull but that means they’d be awesome if you have a smaller head or if you’re gonna use these for exercise.",1
3.0,Great audio but a bit unconfortable,"October 2, 2017",Yes,Good bluetooth headphones. I've tried several. These are actually over the ear and not on the ear (adult ear). The bass level is good. Quiet is quiet (no hiss). Did not breakup signal at all (some expensive ones did). My less expensive ones that broke actually had more bass level. Highs are nice. Worth a purchase if you want actual real over the ear bluetooth and don't want to pay $100. The ear pad thickness is exceptional. 3 stars because the head rest is a bit hard at first and actually gave me a headache until it started forming and softening. Weight was normal. I kept adjusting the top head rest and earned 3 stars I think it needs more head foam which I will add. Takes a standard mirco usb to charge. You cannot charge and use the bluetooth. I watched 3 movies in series without battery failing. Jack and short cable for 3.5 to 3.5 stereo M/M. I actually moved it to 3 stars after looking at my cheap headphone. The ear cup doesn't swivel far enough and pushes the ear cup away from your hear and thus flattens the top out making it uncomfortable. My cheap ones again have a full arm swivel so the cup/headrest fits the contour of your head. I actually used the nice soft carrying bag as extra foam - problem solved. Whatever works.,0
5.0,These things are amazing..,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"These things are amazing...mine generally take 2 hours, some times 3 to charge off of my Macbook Pro, and I get about 2 days of wireless listening and talk time using Skype for Business...Sound quality in wireless mode is crystal clear without a lot of base, for the purists out there it's fairly flat and you'll love it. When you plug it in, however, it changes to a spine-tingling deep, clear, intense listening experience that I've pretty much fallen in love with. Plugging these in also disconnects the battery so if you don't need the wireless you can conserve power significantly by using the audio cable. On long flights this will be invaluable...I'd definitely give these a chance, at this price you can't go wrong!",1
4.0,"Lot of issues using with PC's. Edit: Fixed, shouldn't have two different audio receivers on the PC.","September 15, 2017",Yes,"Had for a few weeks, first wouldn't connect to my computer, bought a bluetooth adapter (The computer has bluetooth already). After a few days, started noticing issues while gaming, has about a 3-4 second delay on games (Not a big deal on most things, but on games is absolutely killer when you're watching lips move and then the sound comes later like a bad dub.) The big kicker, is that recently, while playing games, they make voices sound about 3-4 octaves deeper than they should. Really disconcerting, and added with the rest of the issues, just not worth the hassle...Edit:.Okay, using the Audio Render on the Volume controls instead of Hands Free Audio, and that seems to have fixed it. For now, I'm giving it a 4 star, because I have had issues. Will keep this updated.",1
5.0,Yes!!,"April 13, 2018",Yes,"These fit all of my needs. Are they comfortable? Yes. Do they sound good? Yes. Are they loud enough? YES! Do they pair easily? Yes. Do the controls work? Yes. Does the charge last? Yes...These are great headphones and for under $40, they are incredible headphones. I can wear them for long periods of time (90 minutes) and they feel great. Phone calls aren't a big deal for me but these do a great job with calls. Pause, volume and fast-forward are easily done one right side. I charge them once a week and use them about 7 hours per week. Never died once...For the price they really are perfect.",1
5.0,Well worth the money!,"October 24, 2017",Yes,"I paid $150 for Yurbuds that lasted 4 months. I also paid another $150 for Jbirds, which are still working and good for working out, but I needed something more heavy duty. Boy I wish I know about these earlier...I began taking the train to work for a new job and I wanted earmuff headphones so I could read on the train without being bothered or asked about what I was reading. Yes I have been asked that a couple times before, and no, I am not an attractive girl, or even a girl for that matter. So basically, I bought these because they are not much more that earmuffs on the scheme of things, and I didn't want to come off as a blatant dick by wearing earmuffs in the train. I figured if the sound quality wasn't anything special, it wouldn't be much of a loss for $30. and listening to music on my walks would be an added bonus...I am REALLY glad I got these! The sound quality is awesome! Plus they reduce a lot of noise but I wouldn't go so far to call them noise cancelling, so I can still hear if someone is beeping at me, or there is a fire alarm, or something else like that. BUY THEM! You will not be disappointed.",0
4.0,"For the price these are amazing, but here's the catch","April 7, 2018",Yes,"For the price these are amazing, but here's the catch...for that price. If you're buying these and hoping for the bargain of a lifetime then you better keep looking, but FOR WHAT YOU PAY you will not get any better quality...The headphones look and feel really good, the material and ""finishing"" is similar to what you'd get with top shelf equipment. The headphones are adjustable so they fit my massive head comfortably, and the ""mufflers"" do a pretty good job of keeping noise out (im using the headphones as I'm typing this and I cant hear my usually loud keyboard)..So why am I giving these 4 starts? it's because I dont really care about all the above. What i want from my headphones is great sound quality, and these dont provide the quality I was hoping for. The sound is ""base heavy"", and while that might sound good to some people (including myself) it just doesnt sound as crisp as I was hoping...Overall this wasnt a bad purchase. I needed headphones and these are good enough,",0
5.0,Was looking for sleeping headphones and these work well,"June 25, 2017",Yes,"I use these to sleep with and they are fairly comfortable. A little uncomfortable for side sleeping, but I don't stay on my side too much. I can charge them anywhere between a half hour to two hours and they last all night for me. I had the low battery warning once when I was testing how long I could go without charging and it was semi-loud and woke me up...I have about 4 different speakers and headphones from MPOW and they have worked well and lasted quite a while. When I had one that was faulty soon after I got it, the company sent a replacement, no questions asked, and I didn't have any issues with the replacement.",3
3.0,Not for music,"September 18, 2018",Yes,"Honestly this is probably one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made on Amazon. When the headphones came out of the package, I was very surprised by how nice it looked. The design is sleek, the material feels fairly sturdy, and the interface is simple and easy to use. When I put it on it fit very snugly without clamping too tightly, and was warm but not uncomfortably hot. It even came with split audio and mic jacks instead of one dual jack. It was very promising and had all the makings for a great pair of headphones, but when I actually tried listening to it I was sorely disappointed. It's like when they were designing this thing, they blew all of their budget right before they got to the sound part. The audio is tinny, scratchy, and overall just sounds incredibly cheap, especially around the midrange. There is a constant hissing when sound is playing, and to be honest it just has the audio quality of something you can buy at the dollar store. I think I wouldn't have been let down as much if the headphones itself also looked shoddy, but it didn't. A shame that something with such a slick design left so much to be wanted in terms of where it actually mattered...If the makers of these headphones read this, I want you to know that I would gladly pay double the price for these if you make one with at least acceptable sound quality...Edit:.The customer service however, is top notch! They sent me a new pair immediately after my review. I'll be keeping an eye on this seller for when they release new models, and hopefully find one with improved sound quality.",1
2.0,Will not stay paired!,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"I cant figure out if it is the tansmitter or headphones but one will not stay connected! They worked beautifully and then NOTHING! RADIO SILENCE, I guess I will send both back and move up a grade in quality! Nice headphones for the price and they sound good too! So, the people complaining about that need to realise they are $39 headphones!",3
5.0,Listening with Friends,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"I really enjoy these and love the color. They were a good price for headphones that look expensive lol. I wore these while traveling from the US to Guatemala and back and enjoyed every minute of it and the included aux cord also came in handy. However, 45 hours into traveling I was listening to pretty explicit music very loudly to wake me up a bit for arrival. And this is when my friend sitting next to me lets me know she can hear the music as if I had just brought a speaker. Then my other friend 2 rows up and across the isle turns around to say ""I thought you WERE playing that from a speaker"". Long story short, the whole plane could hear my very explicit music, but other than that they are great!",1
4.0,"Lights flashing, flashing lights.","July 27, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these because I lost the cord to my nice Bose headphones and didn't want to buy an expensive pair of wireless headphones so I chose these. I like a lot about them; you can talk into them while on the phone, there are controls on the ears. There are also some things I don't like about them, they were confusing for me to connect for the first time, they're not comfy to wear to bed (I like to listen to television shows or listen to calming music to fall asleep. But the number one thing I cannot stand about these headphones is the FLASHING LIGHT. Like I said, I like to wear them to bed so it's dark. But not quite, because this FLASHING LIGHT is so bright and distracting. I can see it. The person I sleep with can see it. I tried to cover it with a bandaid and it helped a little... maybe a thicker bandaid will do the trick..I'll keep them because they were cheap and love the wireless, but will also consider getting a nicer pair that's not so big and bulky and also doesn't distract me while in the dark.",9
5.0,Great quality,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"Husband got these to take to work when his position changed and so did his office space. He said he is now in ""cubical land"", (whatever that means) and is having trouble concentrating. He called me as he was leaving the office to key me know that they worked he felt like he was more productive, they blocked background noise and he was able to leave a little early because he finished so much.  Yesterday he told me that a co worker used them and said that the quality was better than his Beats by Dre headphones!.I plan on getting a pair for my self so that I can tune out the background noise at home too!",1
4.0,Great but could be improved just a bit.,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"These headphones work great once you get past the slightly confusing instructions (press a button for 4.5 seconds??) Sound quality is very good and since they are not the noise cancelling type I can leave them on while pausing the music if someone is speaking to me.  They are not light in weight but since they are fully adjustable and have cushioned ear muffins and headband I almost forget they're on my head once the music starts.  Charging is easy and a multi function button on the right headphone controls pause, volume, and track advance...Four stars because there is zero tactile information on the multi function button.  I had to super glue a small metal washer on the center of the button so I could easily find the center and thus navigate to the the outer parameters where the other functions were located.",1
4.0,"Good cheap headset, mic sucks.","June 7, 2017",Yes,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R2HG0L6VVBJAO7""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1E+3jzSKGS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91XW5zbpawS.png""/> So I just got this today and i'm pretty excited, it looks cool, and comes with a case. I connected and everything works fine. However.....It's cheap! you can connect 2 devices to headphones, but they won't work at same time. I also have skullcandy crushers (like $150) and they can do that, but that's expensive lol...The other drawback i saw was the mic, the mic quality sucks, my brother thought i was talking on speakerphone when i called him using the headset. My webcam mic logitech hdcam c270 mic is better. But as a bluetooth headset, i'd say its good, the volume is ok, i dont know audio, but it's comfortable and i hear things!..I added a video, so feel free to check it out",2
4.0,"Great for the price, but don't expect alot of bass.","May 2, 2018",Yes,"First and foremost, these pair of headphones have a lot of pros compared to the cons. I bought these since the ones that I had previous (Bludio T4's), had broken. Since I primarily use over-ear headphones to listen to music nowadays, I wanted something that sounded good without going past $50 (because I'm cheap like that). So, let me start of by stating the pros:..Pro #1: Shipping. Shipping took earlier than expected, which is always a good thing. They arrived about 5 days earlier than stated...Pro #2: Build quality. The build of the product is VERY sturdy, finished with a gloss-like color of your choice. My headphones haven't fallen yet but I can say with certainty that if they did, they would take the hit. (I don't know how you call the color finish like a professional, I'm just stating how I think it feels)...Pro #3: Battery life. The battery life is just right for someone like me that uses headphones all day. With around 20 hours of battery life, you wouldn't need to worry about these headphones fainting on you during the day...Pro #4: Interactivity. The buttons on the right side of the headset work as good as they could, very responsive, so you don't have to worry about it going off if something grazed it, because it does take a fair enough amount of pressure to use the button you want to use. (They are a bit audible when clicking on them but that's just a side note.)..Pro #5: Confort. The ear pads are nicely made with an almost memory foam type feeling that fit around my ears perfectly (Although this won't be the case for most people that have later ears but I digress), the headphone fits my head sturdily but comfortably, by putting just enough pressure that they don't fall off if I'm running or something while also not being crushing...Now for the only con that took me by surprise...Con #1: Bass. In the past I used to own a pair of SONY Extra Bass headphones that were lovely before the broke, as well as the Bluedio T4's that I stated earlier that also had really great bass. So with this type of mindset I thought I would get something at least remotely similar to those, I was half wrong. When I first powered these on and connected them and played music the bass was almost non-exsistant, I had to go into my phone's sound setting and set the bass response to the max to get around 65% of the bass that I achieved with the Bludio T4s. So if you're a bass head like me looking for a pair of cans that have great bass than these are probably not the best for you, BUT the mids and highs are acceptable if that means anything to you...In the end, these are amazing for the price,.When compared by the pros and cons but like I said before, if you're looking for something with some good bass, you could either do the method I tired, or moving on to something a little bit better. (This con is based of personal experience of course so other reviewers might have a different outcome)...Final review: 3.8/5",1
5.0,For $40 I was actually surprised at the sound quality and build quality!,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"Pros: Sound quality, battery life, comfort, and price point..Cons: People with alot of hair may find the headband slightly tight on their head...Overall: I've had these headphones for about a week now and I've been running them for short and extended periods of time to test battery life, function of the mic as well as overall sound quality. For $39.99 I can't even lie.... I thought it was too good to be true. The build quality is amazing for $40. As an audio engineer, I'm really big on quality over volume. These offer pretty solid quality and the volume is almost too loud. Which is a great thing because I won't have to crank the volume up much. The mic works perfectly fine. The battery has been solid through 8 and 9 Hours of constant listening and talking. I haven't tested how long I can keep these going before they cut off but 10 to 15 hours Hours I think is the estimate... I think it might be up to 20 Hours. The build quality is better than the first batch of Beats By Dre's. Don't argue with me. I've owned them and the headband on the Studio and Solo (1st Generation) were freaking HORRIBLE and fragile..Buy them. Don't think about it. Just spend your money..Well worth the money and I'm buying another pair for my brother.",1
3.0,Updated stars.,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"incredible battery life, crisp clear sound, insane bluetooth reach! well built, doesn't feel cheap...Updated feedback: It's been a solid 2 months since I started using it. It was a lovely relationship at first. Good fit, great sound, and long battery life. I had no complaints. Unfortunately, it conveniently breaks just a week after product support closed. I guess I should have registered for a warranty -- but I had faith I didn't have to. It didn't seem to be that sort of item to break so easily. Nonetheless, it will be buried among my graveyard of unused devices. It might still serve as a handy backup at some point. It sounds like listening through an aluminum can now, but the voices can still be heard, albeit its distracting sound quality...Updated again: I got another one. I looked far and wide for another brand, but I'm sticking to this. I can get a bunch for the price of a more expensive brand. I just made sure that I got the warranty and some added insurance this time. ;)",0
3.0,Bad Call Quality. Microphone works terribly.,"July 4, 2018",Yes,"Update: I still think these headphones dont live up to their other reviews, however customer service was very good in responding...I read several reviews of these saying they were great but they are nowhere near living up to that. So I hope you guys got paid good money for those reviews...Headphones sound average, bluetooth connection is pretty good but the call functions are awful. No one can hear me when I speak into them unless I'm practically screaming, bit their voices in the headphones are so loud I have to put it on the lowest volume setting.",1
3.0,Fine for the price.,"May 6, 2018",Yes,"Eh, fine for the price. Kinda tight, gives me a headache after like an hour of wearing, which is crazy because I have a childishly small head. It also has pairing issues sometimes, and seems like it's always running out of battery (which probably contributes to the pairing issues).  The sound quality is fine though, and aside from the headache, none of the problems are insurmountable, just kind of annoying...Update: MPOW contacted me and sent a different replacement pair of headphones that work better. The headband is softer and more flexible, and the over-ear portions are more modular.",1
3.0,"Decent, but depends on what you're looking for","September 11, 2018",Yes,"So, I've had these headphones for a few days now..Full disclaimer: this is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones. I certainly wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of headphones..I bought these looking for a few things, namely quality of sound, good Bluetooth connection, lower price, and style...pros:.~The sound quality is pretty good. Like I said, I'm not a expert, but to me they sound pretty good..~They connect quickly and easily to both my phone and computer. My apartment is small, but I haven't had any trouble leaving my phone in one room and walking to the next. This is a big plus for me and one of the reasons I bought these to begin with..~Comfortable. I can wear these for a few hours, easy..~They aren't sound canceling, but when I'm playing something they're pretty close. I've also tested louder videos and so far, my roommates haven't complained. Also a bonus..~I really like the way it tells me that there's an incoming call. The microphone seems to work well; nobody has complained yet and the audio coming in was decent, if just a bit lower than I wanted it to be...Cons:.~These headphones are not pretty. They're huge and not in a flattering way. As vain as it sounds, I'm looking for a pair of headphones that are slim and modest. These are not the right pair. The way they're built push the speakers out and I look ridiculous when I wear them. These are not the right pair for people with smaller heads; I'm pretty petite and these headphones are pretty big and heavy for me. This might end up being a deal breaker for me..~I'm concerned about how well these will hold up over time. I'm concerned that the plastic will bend or break easily..~The buttons seem to work well, but the volume up button doesn't seem to actual raise the volume. The opposite button works and you can hear the volume decrease, but it doesn't seem to increase...?.~I listen to plenty of audio-books and whenever I happen to listen to something a little quieter, I can hear a faint ringing noise. It's aggravating and frankly, a little creepy. I've had this issue across several different books...so I think it's these headphones and not a faulty recording...As pleased as I am with these headphones, the ringing noise and overall look of the headphones might tempt me to return them and try my luck elsewhere. I'm going to give it a few more days before deciding, but if I'm going to spend forty bucks on a pair of headphones, they'd better at least look nice..Otherwise, a twenty dollar pair would do the same trick, you know what I mean?",0
5.0,"great product -- battery charge seems to last a long, long time","September 30, 2017",Yes,"I bought these as a gift for someone, however, she said they didn't fit her head properly.  Well, they fit my head just fine so she gave them to me.  I was going to return them but decided to try them out -- they're wonderful.  I don't care for the red but they work just fine.  The battery life is good -- I listen to NPR or music at the office for hours each day for several days.  I've been using them for months and have charged them maybe 4 times.  I've learned to turn them off and on when they're not on my head because the voice that comes on and announces, ""your headset is connected"" and ""pairing"" is very loud no matter what volume the speakers are turned to.  No matter -- still a great product.",1
4.0,"Sound great, long battery life","December 15, 2017",Yes,"These phones feel good. They cover my ears. And they sound good too..

They should for $200, but I put my equipment through some pretty rough use working outside and I don't want to destroy $200 headphones. These same friends are surprised at how good these headphones sound,  low price or not..  Another issue I've had with lower priced gear is battery life. I've ran these headphones eight hours and they still worked. I don't know how long the battery will go but I'm impressed so far..  I wish the side controls were a little better defined. Its easy to push the wrong button.",1
5.0,Love love love!,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"These headphones flipping rock my socks off.  I'll be honest, I have a fat head so they are a bit tight on me for just regular chilling-at-my-work desk... but man oh man when I'm sprinting around house-cleaning or cooking in the kitchen, it's nice to have a pair of headphones that won't fall off my head.  Sound quality, bluetooth strength, and battery are all wonderful.  I love that I have the option to plug in an aux cord or use them wirelessly- if you have the aux cord plugged in, they automatically turn off and they don't use battery at all.  I bought a cheaper pair for my desk at work and honestly, I hate them.  hahaha! So I'll be purchasing another pair of these so I can have a pair at home and a pair at work.  You really can't go wrong with these!",1
4.0,Dope!,"January 16, 2018",Yes,"I love these so far. I literally just received them a couple hours ago and haven’t put them down. I got the red ones and the are perfect. It was easy to pair and come with instructions if you need them. I can be heard clearly when on calls and when I’m listening to music, the sound is amazing! The bass is pretty nice too considering the type of music I listen to lol. I haven’t tried them with my laptop but for everything else so far so good..The only con I guess would be the super snug fit. It’s a good thing because you don’t have to worry about them sliding off your head but at the same time, it might give you a headache later. So perhaps it’s just personal preference. I’d say go for it! I’m glad I did.",1
5.0,An amazing value as long as they last.,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"These are very good headphones. This is not only my opinion but the general consensus. The real test is going to be ""how long are these going to last?"" The overall build quality on these is extremely good for the price. The headphones are surprisingly comfortable and have a good weight to them. I have bought many pairs of headphones in the past and I am usually pretty happy with them but it never seems to last. Something usually goes wrong that is out of my control from internal wires splitting to audio degradation. Considering the quality of these headphones, say these lasted 2 years, this would be an absolutely must buy amazing deal. Like I said everything is good. It always is at first. How long will these last? If they make it past a year I will be happy and that's just from a cost-efficiency perspective.",1
5.0,"Great product, great customer service!!","March 10, 2018",Yes,"I'm so sorry I left a bad review thinking the headset wasn't compatible with Linux when it was! Turns out to be a more specific problem not related to the headset, and the headset works great. As stated before, it is so very comfortable, and well-made. It does work well with everything including anything Linux that is compatible with bluetooth. My husband had a problem (not related to the headset) with a Raspberry Pi that was running a certain Linux thing that had a patch right before we used it, and the patch caused problems connecting bluetooth devices. THIS COMPANY reached out to us after I left my initial review, and wanted to know more so they could improve, and informed me of their guarantee (meaning I could still get a refund) but I found out at the same time that the headset was A-OKAY! I really appreciate them responding. I will definitely purchase again should the need arise. This could make a great gift.",0
5.0,"Excellent headset, the battery life is excellent","November 27, 2017",Yes,"Excellent headset, the battery life is excellent, it is comfortable and easy to use, perfectly suppresses the external music in the gym that is what I was looking for 100% recommended as a bluetooth headset, but as a wireless microphone, to receive or make a call it is bad, of 5 incoming calls, only 2 enter in the other 3 the handset remains in silence and one must pick up the phone and answer it manually, it did not help me to receive calls, it is annoying..But as I said what I was looking for was a bluetooth headset that can suppress the external music in the gym, that's why I give it 5 stars, and the battery lasts a lot an average of 3 hours a day for 5 days without recharging.",1
3.0,... was going to give it 5 stars as I love these headphones,"October 28, 2017",Yes,"I was going to give it 5 stars as I love these headphones. We even bought a second pair for my husband. Sadly, after a month of using them, the sound doesn't play when connected to bluetooth. When I connect via the aux cable the sound works fine. I have tried to pair it with my iphone, my windows tablet, and no luck. I don't even hear the lady say ""pairing"" or ""disconnected."" I have tried the trick of holding the multifunction button and the + at the same time while connecting, still nothing. I have update my phone, reset network settings, and yet still nothing. I would like to enjoy the headphones wirelessly. I have connected the second pair successfully to my iphone and tablet. So I know it's just the pair I have.",2
3.0,Decent for the money but will be uncomfortable for extended use,"July 12, 2018",Yes,"For the price it's hard to beat but there are flaws...Pro.1) Cheap.2) Easy to connect.3) Battery life is good.4) On ear play, skip, pause, are responsive.5) Sound is what you would expect from headphones at this price..Cons.1) Sound is hollow.2) Headphone cones are too small.3) Uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time..I got these to use in the office so I wouldn't disturb others. They are what you would expect for sub $40 headphones. My biggest complaint with these are that the headphone cups are too small and they press against your ears. This will cause your ears to sweat and become sore after use more than 60-90 minutes. The sound also bleeds out of them at louder volumes so others will be able to hear them. You know what I'm talking about if you have ever been on an airplane or bus and heard the excess sound from someone's earbuds...Bottom line: If you can afford to spend $50-100 more on a pair of Sony headphones you wont be disappointed. I recommend the Sony XB950BT which offer great sound quality and are very comfortable. They also allow the ability to turn on an extra bass mode if you are into that sort of thing.",1
1.0,I had high hopes due to the good reviews but I ended up returning it,"December 20, 2017",Yes,I was looking for a Bluetooth headset that I could use for conference calls. I had high hopes due to the good reviews but I ended up returning it. Sound quality wasn't good (sounded muffled) and when using the mic you could hear a clicking sound every few seconds and sounded like you were in a tunnel. Maybe it is fine for occasional use but not for corporate use.,3
4.0,Comfy--honestly better than many Beats,"January 15, 2018",Yes,"For $40, you really can't complain...PROS:.Comfy--honestly better than many Beats, Sony's, and my beloved Audio‑Technica ATH‑M50x..Bluetooth pairing was easy.Battery life seems good so far.Surprisingly decent amount of bass..CONS:.Audio quality is decent but doesn't come close to higher-end headphones. I was holding out hope it would be close to Audio-Technica ATH-M50x's but they are not. Honestly for the price, I'm not surprised--I'm not mad, but I was slightly disappointed. Quality-wise it just sounds like you're listening to 96kbps audio even if you're streaming at 512kbps...SUMMARY:.Worth the $40 I paid, great to be able to throw in the gym bag and not worry if they someday get crushed or stolen, nice to be wireless, but for serious listening I'm keeping my Audio-Technica ATH-M50's.",2
5.0,Great Customer Service,"January 30, 2018",Yes,"This was a Christmas gift for my grandson. They are easy to get connected to Wi-Fi. However, just a month after Christmas, they no longer work. When they are plugged in being charged, the light shows its being charged but then they never charge. They were great for a month...updated review:  Since my previous review, the company has contacted me and made everything right.  They have sent me a new pair of headphones.  I am very impressed with their followup and how they wanted to make me satisfied.  I would purchase from this company again.  I thought I was out of luck because I purchased them a couple months before Christmas and was past the return date for Amazon.  The new pair works great.",2
4.0,An incredible buy for the money.,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"OK, to start with, I want to say that, for the money, it is one incredible piece of equipment.  I am not only happy I bought it, but I would buy it again and I would buy it as a gift.  Now, why Four, instead of five stars?  I must admit that I wish I could have gone 4½ stars, but either way.  My only real issue is that it has a slight tinny sound; both on my end and on the side of the person to whom I am speaking.  For music, again, a slight tinny sound.  I want this clear....  It is very slight and to most people it would not even be a concern, maybe not even noticeable.  My only other issue is that my ears get hot as hell.  In fact, that is really my only serious issue.  I think that issue is more a problem to do with me, rather than a flaw in the device, but you need to be aware that it could be an issue for you as well.  No question, the padding and material is comfortable, it just gets hot after about 15 minutes.  Summing it up, an incredible buy for the money.",0
5.0,"Super comfortable, very good sound quality","August 25, 2017",Yes,"This headphones replaced an older set that fell apart. I thought my old ones sounded pretty good until I listened to Mpow headset via blue tooth. First thing I noticed was how soft and comfortable the ear pieces and headband were. They fit snuggly onot my ears but not too much pressure. They were still comfortable after over an hour of listening. The sound quality is very good, even with a blue tooth feed. The music is balanced with good response. There is plenty of bass, but not so much it muddied the rest of the sound. Controls are easy to use with voice confirmation. They did require 3 hours of charging before I used them, but that is not unusual. I like them and I hope they will stay working for a long time.",1
5.0,"Sound great, comfortable and appear to be well built.","January 1, 2018",Yes,"These headphones, for the short time I have had them, have been great.  They sound good, although, I can hear more outside noise than I thought I would, with headphones that completely cover your ears.  I know they are not active noise canceling, though, so not a big problem.  They seem sturdy, well made and they are comfortable.  I was looking for headphones that would go on ear or over ear, as the headphones that go in your ears have been bothering me a bit lately.  They connected easily with my Android phone, as well.  I have not used them for a phone call yet, so I don't know how well the microphone works, which I read has been a problem for others.  We'll see.",1
4.0,Awesome headphones!!,"July 26, 2018",Yes,"Was looking for a decent set of over-ear headphones to use at the gym because ear-buds DO NOT stay in for me. The price for these was just what I was looking for. They are comfortable and the battery lasts FOREVER. I use them about 3 times a week for about an hour at a time, I have charged these headphones TWICE in the month plus that I've had them. Great sound, not completely noise cancelling but do a good job...Only two complaints:..Turning off takes quite a while, have to hold the power button for about 6-7 seconds for them to shut off..Every now and then it sounds like there is a little ball or something loose in the right headphone that is rattling around. Doesn't happen often enough to be a nuisance, just something worth noting. Can't expect perfection for $40 and these are great!",0
4.0,You wont find a better set for the price,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"These are great for the price.  My only problem is that the controls are so smooth that you really have to feel what you are doing.  A suggestion for any news ones would be to add small bumps so you know what button you are pushing.  I also have a hard time skipping backwards, I have to hit the back button three or fours and that is if it works.  If I am on a song, it will replay the song, but going past it, it is a problem.  Going forwards isn't a problem...I work in a data center and it is very loud in general.  With this headphones, I don't have to listen to music as loud (good for long term hearing loss) and I also use it when troubleshooting problems with customers on phone calls...The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the issue with going back in my music.  With that said, I will buy these again and again.  You get more for the price than other headphones I've had.",0
4.0,Decent headphones,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"Picked these up for watching TV &amp; movies on my Amazon Fire TV Stick; with it's Bluetooth connection. (After using earbuds that hurt my ears.) Interestingly, while watching Sling, Amazon TV, Movies, etc....I have noticed, ...and maybe it's just me... that after binge watching a few movies in a row on Bluetooth; loud volume, or certain pitches of sounds start to seem slightly distorted. This is usually my, ""I should charge these after this movie"" cue... I'm still quite happy with these though...The sound is good, pretty well rounded. Range is no problem at all, compared to the ear buds I was replacing. Overall, if you're looking for a pair of headphones to watch TV and movies wirelessly over Bluetooth, these win leaps and bounds over RF wireless sets I've tried previously...The buttons on the headphones work to: Pause/Resume, Fast Forward, and Rewind (in channels where supported).",0
5.0,Great Choice For The Money,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"Pairing these headphones was a snap. They fit comfortably once I figured out what to do with my earrings. I wear 3 ball closure rings in each ear and these headphones are snug enough that they put too much pressure on the earrings and earlobes. Now I just tuck the rings up into the ear cups and everything is cake...They don't give me a headache after long use like some have, and the sound is rich and full. I like having volume control on the unit so I can adjust when I'm away from my pc. I haven't fully tested the range but so far I've managed 30 feet in line of sight and 20 feet around 2 corners. They're keepers.",1
5.0,"Updated Review: So far, so good! Audio is great and easy to use.","April 19, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE:.I received a replacement pair to replace the ones in my first review. So far, they are holding up, and the sound quality is great, as expected. I will update this review if any issues arrive, but at this point in time, I love these headphones. They are easy to connect and easy to operate. I am a big fan of Mpow products, so I really hope these stand up to the test of time. I know there are some newer models of these headphones and I would love to try them out. Maybe once I wear these out...Previous Review:.Initially I had really high hopes for this product. The ear pads are comfortable and the Bluetooth audio was great. However , after owning these for a couple of months, it has begun to fall apart. I'm very disappointed I  the craftsmanship as I really like them. Unfortunately I am out of the return window so I cannot return them, but definitely would if I could. Buyer beware.",0
5.0,"Excellent headphones, excellent price, amazing sound quality, BUT DON'T EXPECT ANY BASS.","August 6, 2017",Yes,"In Quick Summary: These headphones on the outside look visually pleasing and look very professional. They drain out noise, but others can hear your music as well. They feel tight most of the time, which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. On the inside, the sound quality is amazing and does not fail to shine, HOWEVER, do not expect to hear ANY bass at all. These headphones work great but have no bass whatsoever...Longer Explanation: I bought this product for the cheap price and great design. The product delivers on both aspects of that and in spades. They feel comfortable to wear but can feel rather tight no matter how you set them up. The quality of the product itself is excellent, it does not feel cheap and feels extremely well made. The headphones also fold which is a nice touch. The headphone control button is also interesting, where it's the main button that you use to play/pause, take phone calls, and holding it down for certain time periods turns on/off the headphones and pairs it to whatever device. Of course, this is no problem to me and at first seems complicated but gets easier the more you use it...The sound quality of this product is phenomenal. The sound is extremely crisp, and does not drop quality or quickly disconnects and reconnects from the Bluetooth device (or not at all if you use the provided AUX cord). The sound can be heard from others when played at max volume, so do not act surprised when you're in a quiet environment and everyone suddenly looks your way. My only problem with these headphones, which is my fault and not the headphones, is that there is no bass. If any, it is so weak you cannot feel it. For people who want bass, these headphones do not offer such an option which is disappointing but not surprising as it is not a selling point for these headphones...If you're looking for headphones with amazing sound and very little to no base, THESE ARE AN EXCELLENT PAIR FOR YOU. I'd give it 5 stars for physical design, 4 1/2 for sound. For now, 5 is the best I can do because 4.75 is not an option, and these headphones do not deserve a 4.0.",2
5.0,And we are back,"November 22, 2017",Yes,"Update: I received a replacement and I am very happy with the customer service I received. Despite the first ones falling apart, I appreciate the replacement from the seller who didn’t even hesitate to send the replacement. The headphones really are great and I am glad I can keep rocking these...Sounded great. Until they fell apart. The hinge broke despite keeping it in its own compartment in my backpack. The last week they started sounding fuzzier too. The bass kept frying.  Guess I’ll be getting new and likely sturdier headphones on Black Friday! I’ve had earbuds that have much more abused than these things still kicking.",2
5.0,Works as advertised and then some,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"My wife has trouble hearing the TV, so Bluetooth earphones were the solution.  These paired up perfectly with my new 65"" Samsung QLED.  When you turn them up, a screen pops up, and you just use the remote to connect.  Sound quality is clear, and once you get them on, most sound, even conversation, is blocked out.",3
4.0,"Hard to connect, average sound quality, excellent customer service","March 1, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphones for my RV to listen to TV in privacy.  I could not get them to connect, tried a couple of transmitters.  Best Buy tried and could not get to connect either, but then they couldn't get any of their headphones to connect either.  I then bought the MPOW bluetooth transmitter/receiver (Tx/Rx) and after several tries, got it to connect.  The key is to hold the phones next to the Tx/Rx, trigger the search on the phones, then trigger the search on the Tx/Rx.  This combination is average in sound quality and volume.  I noticed they have a noise reduction circuit that works for music, but is not great for TV.  UPDATE:  Patazon Customer service initiated contact with me after my 3 star review, and they sent me a new pair of headphones to try.  They are exactly like the first set, with average sound quality and volume, and a background noise cancelling circuit that doesn't work well for TV use.  However, I added a star for good customer service.",0
5.0,"Small head, perfect fit, amazing sound.","April 23, 2018",Yes,"First off the fit on these is amazing. I guess I must have a small head because I see many people wearing headphones with the side extensions fully extended. Not my case. I can never get them small enough to fit right. These actually fit my head without wobble. So many others I have tried (and sent back) wouldn't adjust small enough to sit on top of my head without wobble caused by a gap between the top of my head and the head piece. These actually are a perfect fit. 2nd off, the ear cups fit entirely over my ear so that the cushions are on the side of my head, not pressing against my ear which means I can wear these all day without discomfort. Now lets get to the sound. Simply put, they sound amazing. I can't believe they are so cheap. I have found my go to BT headphones. I will definitely order again and I might pick up a pair for the house. (I got these for work)..I don't have any lag between video and audio.",0
5.0,So far it is working beautifully!,"September 27, 2018",Yes,"So far, it is working better than expected. The sound quality is great for a bluetooth device. I can walk all around my large home and still hear it really clearly. Even at the far points, there is very little breaking down of the signal. I love the controls. They are smooth and easy to find even when I am pressing them without looking at buttons. I like the voice prompts. Clear and not annoying. They are very surprisingly comfortable too! Usually anything on my ears bothers me after as short while, but I wore these without an issue for hours! Even while laying down! Battery life is good too! Haven't had to charge it yet and I've used them everyday for a few hours at a time. Their noise cancelling works way better than I needed, but that is great for many people. For me, I still need to hear my young kids so I have to be mindful of the volume of my music or else I will not hear any outside noise!.Only time will tell if they will last and remain durable. I'll post an update in a few months.",0
5.0,"Essentially knock-off Beats Studio Wireless, only one-tenth the cost.","August 9, 2017",Yes,"Comfortable and true over-ear headphones.  Before these, I bought the Bluiedo turbines, and they honestly were horrible.  I wanted to save the extra $10 with those headphones, but I ended up buying these due to how bad the turbines were.  These are true over-ear phones.  Not only that, but the sound quality is very good.  I'm not an audiophile, but I have had these for less than a day and I can already tell the quality is far superior to any headphones I have tried in the past.  My friend has some Beats Studio Wireless headphones, which are absolutely amazing and cost $300.  These cost only $35, and are surprisingly comparable headphones.  They are quite nearly perfect.  The build quality is good, they feel like a pillow on your head, and the Bluetooth is surprisingly not bad.  The hissing sound in the background of all bluetooth headphones is much more muffled in these.  These were the first pair that I could use in Bluetooth mode without the hissing annoying me constantly.",1

These look very large on me because I have a small head. The sound is nice, nothing to write home about. I wish that I could adjust the volume on the voice that tells me it's powering on or pairing, because it can be very loud. I appreciate the light to indicate the power is on, but that does keep me from using them at night, since it would light up the bedroom and wake my husband.",2
5.0,Very nice comfortable headphones.,"October 12, 2017",Yes,"I've only used these a couple of times so far, but I really like the headphones. They are very comfortable, the sound is good for me, and I love the fact that when I listen to music or my audible books, while I'm vacuuming, that they really mute the sound of the vacuum. In fact, I'm sure they're better for my ears, since I don't have to turn the volume up as much with these!  I also love not having to deal with any wiring anymore getting in the way. All in all, very happy with this purchase.",2
5.0,Pros &amp; Cons,"March 10, 2018",Yes,"**UPDATED REVIEW:.So in my initial review, I thought the audio quality wasn't great. This company reached out to me and sent me a complimentary replacement pair. They were incredibly customer service oriented and I really appreciate how quickly they responded. The replacement pair was exactly what i was hoping for when I bought these and I'm really pleased! I would def recommend these!..- the battery life is amazing. The Bluetooth range is amazing. Very easy to set up..- microphone works great. I used these headphones for VoIP calls all day and not an issue to be had..- noise reduction was great. Even on the train I could still hear the video I was watching quite clearly..- overall great! Fantastic steal for the price!.- delivery was super fast, everything was included and in perfect condition..- great for audiobooks, podcasts, gaming, phone calls.",0
4.0,Revised - to a 4 start 😀,"August 3, 2017",Yes,"You have to love and appreciate when the 'extra mile' is taken regarding a product.  Initially, I was displeased w the product due to it losing, 'Wireless Connectivity.'  Upon hearing my displeasure, I was given a new pair, with no hesitation.  That is a true commitment to excellence and as long as these hold up a 5 rating may be in the future :)..Initial - I've only had them a few months and the 'pairing' feature just stopped working.  The main feature wanted was for 'Bluetooth Connectivity' and that seems to be gone.  Not too happy, and won't purchase this brand again.  Should have known for the price, I would get this.  Thank you, Amazon for co signing this product only to get the opposite.",2
4.0,A few flaws give away this isn't a high-end headset,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have a pretty good poker face, but it has a few tells that give away that its a budget-minded product...Overall, it has decent sound. The low notes are obviously boosted to hide any real flaws in the sound, and also to probably keep in line with the trend of overly bass-y headphones. The overall build quality feels sturdy, I don't feel like its going to break when I stuff it in my bag at the airport. Its reasonably comfortable to wear with glasses, can go several hours with these on. Battery life is also acceptable, getting through several work days on a single charge...The first giveaway that this isn't a more expensive headset is the bare bones packaging, and the user guide written in bad English. The second giveaway are the control buttons on the headset itself: cheap, bulky, and loud...The multi-purpose power/pair/answer/hang-up/trigger assistant/play-pause button is also a little tricky to use. Hold for 2 seconds: power on. Hold for 5 seconds: power off. But if you let go too early, you'll trigger the bluetooth pairing, which is Hold for 3 seconds. But wait, there's more! Hold for just one second and you'll trigger your personal assistant (Siri, Cortana, Google). A single tap will play/pause music...The power and bluetooth functions also get a somewhat loud, almost-British female voice announcing what command you've triggered. ""Power on, Phone 1 connected."" followed by a tone, will loudly greet you every time turn on this headset. At the end of your day, after an awkwardly long 5-second press, the nearly-british female voice will loudly announce ""Power Off""...Most obnoxiously, when you turn the volume all the way down, the lady will loudly proclaim ""Mute!"" in your ears. Pity the person who has a scrolling type of volume function on their device, as she will loudly repeat ""Mute!"" many times over...One last thing that I noticed was the status light that surrounds the multi-purpose button. At first, it looks like the entire ring ought to light up as a multi-color led, but in fact there is a separate blue light and red light within the ring, on the opposite sides of the ring. The blue light periodically flashes while the device is on; and it startled me at night in my dark office- it was surprisingly bright and somewhat distracting. (See photo of the flash of blue)..I would think twice if I was wearing this headset in a dark public setting, such as an airplane at night. The blue and red light alternate like an emergency vehicle when the headset is in pairing mode. Its feels really tacky...As I stated in the beginning, these detraction's are more like ""tells"" than they are negatives against the headset. I wrote this review so that future buyers know ahead of time in what ways this is a ""budget"" headset. You're buying a decent headphone with some odd quirks to save some money: a fair tradeoff.",1
5.0,Awesome headphones!,"December 21, 2017",Yes,"Love this headset.  It may be a little on the big side but it fully covers my ears (average size ears).  The battery life is insane.  I charged it on November 27 and I've used it on and off between then and now without charging it again.  Today I decided to charge it again but not because the batter died but rather because I didn't want to get caught when it dies and I want to listen to my music.  Usually, I have a good idea as to how long the battery will last but this thing just keeps going.  The side controls work perfectly and the Bluetooth keeps my music going when I get up to get a cup of coffee or drink of water well over 40 feet away.",1
4.0,Better audio and build quality than expected for the price,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"I've only had them out for a few minutes to fully charge and pair them with my phone/listen to music, so I can't comment on longevity...Overall the build quality is pretty good. The muffs are comfortable and have good isolation, the band feels sturdy as you adjust the ear placement. Me and my son both thought the the top of the band as it goes over your head, though it is padded, kind of feels funny and might get irritating over very long listening sessions. Maybe our heads are just shaped weird...The buttons on the right ear that control play/pause, volume, track +/-: they feel a littly plasticky, a little ""clicky"", very loud in your right ear when you press them. Not a big deal, I paid under $30 for these things, it's just the one area out of the box where you notice the low price of the headphones...I haven't placed a call yet so I don't have any feedback on the quality of the microphone...Overall excellent purchase for the price assuming they last a while.",0
5.0,Wonderful headphones for a cheap price,"July 2, 2018",Yes,"TL;DR: Wonderful headphones for a cheap price, amazing quality!..For how inexpensive these headphones are, I feel they could compete with some of the best!..With these headphones, you have the option between a wired connection, and bluetooth. With bluetooth, you can connect to up to two devices at once. Now, this has its issues, as one device may start playing audio and stop the audio of the original device, however generally this isn't an issue unless a phone call comes in if you are connected to a phone or other mobile device that receives calls or has loud notifications...As far as quality goes, I couldn't be happier with the quality of the audio that goes through! Whether I'm jamming to drums (the noise cancellation is fairly decent) or listening to music at work, the quality is perfect, which was surprising considering they have 40mm drivers rather than the expected 50mm drivers for the size of the headphones, and they cover the 20Hz-20kHz range nicely. They also get very loud, yet can also get very quiet. There's an audio volume for everyone!..They are very comfortable on the head, and I have no complaints of them falling off, they can just to even the biggest of heads and they don't fall off!..Pros:.-Comfortable.-Don't fall off.-Superb quality.-Bluetooth and wired configurations..Cons:.-Dual-connection capability is kind of broken, but it's forgivable unless you have loud notifications",0
4.0,Update: Much better,"February 13, 2018",Yes,"Seemed like great headphones at first, nice and light, sounded crisp and clear, looked good only problem is about 2 months after purchase they're already falling apart. All those things don't really mean much when they're coming apart this quickly...Update: Was sent a new pair, they're holding up much better than the last so I guess I just got unlucky with the pair the last time, these seem like everything I was hoping they would be.",2
5.0,Very pleased with this purchase,"August 24, 2017",Yes,"Very pleased with this purchase. I use it with my clients on the phone. They hear me clearly and I them. You can connect them to 2 Bluetooth devices and the only problem I have is that it takes a couple of tries to get it to connect to the 2nd device (my computer). They do have a pretty good range and I'm able to start a movie or YouTube segment and I can go anywhere within about 50 feet without problem. Go outside and it gets sketchy, but they connect back up with I re-enter the house. I like that the charge lasts a long time ... at least 6 hours or more.",2
5.0,These headphones are perfect! UPDATED after a year of use.,"September 13, 2017",Yes,"Updating to add a photo after a year of daily use. They are still like brand new, even after I've been averaging 10 hours a day working with them on. Battery life is still amazing. Couldn't be happier with these!.---------------.This is the third pair of headphones I bought in two weeks and finally I have a winner! I wear headphones at least 6 hours a day for my job so comfort is a top priority. I wore these comfortably for 7 hours today and I'm thrilled. The earpads are large enough that they go fully around my ears. They fit snugly but not so tight that my head feels like it's in a vice. The battery life is great, the bluetooth works well, the audio quality is good, and they are sturdy and good looking. I couldn't be more pleased!",1
5.0,Great Bluetooth/wired headphones for the price! Love the Bluetooth/Wired combo.,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"I've tried several high quality headphones such as Beats, Audio Technica, Sennheiser and after using the MPOW for 6 months, I have come to realize they a very good headphones for the money.  They may not be the exact same as the above, but very close.  For the price you can't beat it.  I looked at their website and they are a legit company and realized they completely focus on Bluetooth audio equipment.  I see they are a German company and have offices in Europe and America.  I feel better that they are German manufactured and not something cheap from China.  I also like that they sell Bluetooth/FM receivers and transmitters so if you want to use your headphones for TV, gaming, etc.  Great product and I am very happy with it.  I will be buying more from this company.",0
5.0,"Stops accepting a charge, seems to be a fairly common complaint :-/","December 30, 2017",Yes,"It was great for the 1st 70 days, then it stopped accepting a charge and slowly went into a coma from which it hasn't returned..1/4/2018 - Previously a 1 star for the product, but customer service has contacted me and noticed me a replacement is on it's way. 3-stars for now.... Will update after receiving/reviewing the replacement..1-9-2017 - received new headphones (no charge) I'm a happy camper again. **awesome customer service!!! **",2
3.0,Three Stars,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"works as intended.After leaving the above comment, I received a email from customer service offering a refund because I was not satisfied, (five stars for this vendors customer service) I would like to clarify;.These head phone work well, volume, pause, skip to the next song are easy to find and operate while wearing the head phones,  they were easy to set up and pair with my phone. The build quality is above average..The sound quality is average, not a lot of bass or treble, and a bit of distortion when the volume is up, but of you want the fidelity you would need to spend a few more dollars and a high end set of head phones..I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for head phones to listen to music or books or whatever while banging around..For the price it would be difficult to find a better deal or better quality headphones.",0
5.0,GREAT Price and Battery LIfe and Very Comfortable.,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"I have had these headphones for almost 2 months and I have used them regularly in the gym, at work listening to music and on conference calls. I have not had any issues. The only issue I had was that the sounds became very muffled sounding but it turns out it was just because the battery was getting low. This was totally acceptable because I had not charged them for a week after using regularly over 4-5 days. I am a music producer and find the quality of the audio slightly lacking but should be fine to the general user. Note: I don't use these for mixing :-) just for gym and audio calls...Pros:.Battery Life is SUPERB.- Syncs easily with MAC, Android, iPhone..- Comfortable.- Great price..- Durable. I have them in my bookbag that I sling around and both my kids use theirs daily and they're still fine...Cons:.- Audio is not for an audiophile but price more than makes up for that..- Sync issues with ChromeOS, have to restart the Chrome notebooks, not sure if thats a ChromeOS issue as I haven't had the issue on any other devices.",0
4.0,9.75 out of 10 almost perfect!,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"Audio quality: 9.75 out of 10.Comfort:  10/10.Wireless range: 10/10.These headphones sound very nice.  Excellent sound quality.  Very comfortable.  They are almost perfect except for 2 *tiny* almost insignificant details that prevent me from giving it a perfect 5 star rating:  the controls.  I am really trying to nit pick here, but where you press the buttons, they are loud in your ear.  They have a very loud CLICK sound when you press them.  Second, the control wheel is a smooth wheel with no texture.  I can't tell what buttons I'm pressing!  Solution?  I used a hole punch to punch out a few perfect circles out of some sticky felt I had.  I made perfect little felt circle stickers and I placed them over the controls.  The solution?  Tactile buttons!.With a small modification, I think you'll be very happy with these headphones.",0
5.0,Great Bluetooth Headphones,"August 24, 2017",Yes,"Love these headphones - they connect quickly, the battery seems to last forever, and the audio quality is great. It's worth noting that they don't have an ""active"" noise cancellation... it's just that the padding around the ears absorbs sound really well...I do feel like I need to get a case of some kind for when I'm transporting these headphones around. They came with a cloth pouch, but I tend to throw these in my backpack going to and from work, and I worry that the joints might get jostled and start to come loose (hasn't happened yet, but I'm bracing for it).",2
5.0,It arrived on time and in good condition. Easy to setup however,"November 9, 2017",Yes,"It arrived on time and in good condition. Easy to setup however, bass is not that powerful. Sound is clear though...I changed my review to 5 stars because I appreciate the seller concern about buyer's satisfaction. The seller sent a new model of their bluetooth headphone and let me keep the first one. I must say that the second one is better bass-wise. There is nothing wrong with these headphones, very comfortable and clear. My only complaint was the bass is not a loud, although it can be fixed by adjusting the bass level on bluetooth devices. Great job looking out, Patozon Customer service!! I already recommended you to my friends and families.",1
5.0,Quality at an affordable price.,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"First impressions out of the box these headphones feel great. They're almost entirely plastic, however they feel so solid and flexible that I wouldn't be scared to toss them around a bit. Lightweight for a pair of over ears and nice looking. They certainly look and feel more expensive than they are. The cushions on the cups and headband had a very factory-ish smell to them, but it wore away after a day of use...Sound - Whether you're using them wired or Bluetooth the headphones produce a high pitched, quite hissing noise that you won't notice when listening to music but will definitely give you a headache when yours scrolling through tracks. That's where the negatives stop, though, since these headphones sound extremely decent for the price point. Highs are clear, mids are smooth, and lows can be heard, though these aren't going to vibrate off your head with the amount of bass it's packing. If your a basehead, you might wanna keep searching. For me, though, it's the perfect amount...Build - The cushioning on these headphones feel great. Very soft and provide excellent noise canceling, which is good because if you let them these headphones can get loud enough to be a mini speaker. The Bluetooth connection is reasonably strong. In having these for a week I've only very occasionally had the connection skip on me while my phone was in my pocket. Not perfect, but not a deal breaker. The middle button on the right cup has a blue light that flashes every 5 seconds when paired with something. It's just as annoying as you'd imagine, but not noticeable by the wearer unless your in a dark area. I was upset to find that the buttons don't do anything when using the headset wired, unlike other wired headphones, but again: No deal breaker..Something that was a VERY welcome surprise was the battery life. I make it a habit to charge anything I order out of the box before using. On a full battery these headphones have lasted me 7+ hours of continuous on time without even giving a low battery warning. Very impressive stuff...Final verdict - These aren't going to replace any studio grade headsets you may find on Amazon, but they aren't supposed to. These are well made, competent headphones that get the job done and then some while looking good doing it. I'm happy with them and I'm sure you'll be too...I'll be sure to do business with Mpow again in the future.",0
4.0,"Pros: Good Sound and Comfortable Fit and Movement | Cons: Meh Mic, Weird Bluetooth Connectivity sometimes","March 18, 2018",Yes,"The headset is small and beautiful and comes with a little usb to micro-usb charger, the audio cable, a string baggy to store everything, and a tiny guide booklet. The sound quality is pretty good, and the ear pads are very soft and comfortable, cupping your ears and blocking out some sound. The Bluetooth set-up is pretty easy, but you have to make sure you read the booklet to figure out how the buttons on the headset work. Thankfully, the headset uses sound effects, voice, and colorful blinking lights around the buttons to tell you if it's powered on or charging and so on. The built-in microphone, unfortunately, makes me sound a little muffled. I've also had some strange connectivity issues with the Bluetooth with sound completely disappearing or videos buffering, and it turns out this depends on what programs are using the headset, so you have to make sure you play with those settings. Overall, however, wearing these was a big change from my last headset which had an extremely long cable that made it impossible to move comfortably or get up and dance. These feel so good and freeing and were a good purchase even though the microphone could be better!",0
5.0,Very generous over the ear space. Very comfortable.,"March 15, 2018",Yes,These are surprisingly good. I was willing to put $100-$250 into headphones but when I saw how well rated these were I thought I would try them first...I often work until 2-4am after I put my daughter to bed at 9pm. Her bed room is right over my office. If I listen to music it can wake her up. I wanted headphones I could use for several hours and not find uncomfortable later...Comfort A+.I have medium sized ears and these fit very well over my ears so no pressure is on them. I have plenty of extra space for my ears but the headphones still fit snugly...Sound A+.I'm not an audiophile but listening to music on youtube was excellent...Design A+.I love that they fold down. This will be great for travel on a plane...Price A+++.For the money I can't imagine it getting much better...I highly recommend it!,0
5.0,Great purchase!,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for our 10 year old son as a Christmas present. He loves them for listening to music and watching Netflix from his phone. He was also really excited to find out that they work for phone calls (we’ve had no problems with connectivity or sound when on a call with him). He let me try them on and I found them to be super comfortable with good sound.  Nice padding and headphone cup covers the whole ear. No wires in the way is a plus, as is having the option to plug in in case of low battery.  Tempted to buy a pair for myself, but I’ll stick with earbuds as I’m a little too old to pull off the look :) great purchase, especially for the price point. Hoping they last. Will update if anything changes.",1
4.0,"Great Sound, but Pretty Large","October 29, 2018",Yes,"These are definitely high quality, have great sound and long battery life.  I've had a great listening experience from that perspective, for sure...They are a bit heavy and bulky though, so I'm limited in how long I can wear them before they become very uncomfortable for me.  I can go about an hour and a half or so before needing a break to recover from the pressure...It could just be me and my sensitive ears/skin, so I highly recommend purchasing and trying out for yourself!",1
5.0,Surprisingly Great Quality for a Low Price!,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"I had been looking for a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones for awhile.  I checked all the reviews and took some time before I decided.  I was initially worried that the price of these headphones would only bring a piece of crap and little to no quality to my door.  I was almost convinced that if I didn't spend at least $80.00 on a pair of Bluetooth headphones I wouldn't get a quality pair.  Boy was I wrong.  I received these the other day and was surprised at the quality.  They are very sturdy and look more expensive than what I paid.  So far so good.  Pairing them was my next fear.  I thought, sure they look good but will they be a pain to pair with my TV.  I followed the directions and within 1 minute they were paired to my TV.  The sound is great and there is no lag time.  I really like these headphones!  Now I can watch TV without disturbing anyone.  If you are looking for a pair of headphones that work great and won't break the bank, you will really enjoy these.",1
5.0,Takes A Licking and Keeps on Ticking,"December 19, 2017",Yes,"A pair of headphones at this price range to do all this? Lets put that to the test...I have owned these things now for just over a month and have literally put these things through the wringer. Full out workout with a profound amount of sweat going on, warehouse work, even by accident dropped these...Still going strong...Only thing it got was a large scratch on the black paint over the left speaker...Bass on these things is above average, however if you are looking for that deep deep crisp bass, these headphones are not it. If you are looking for that thump style bass like the old 80's boom boxes played, then these are the perfect pair...Treble is relatively smooth...Main concern for my case is how would these things hold up over a workout. When I work out, I don't mess around. Will work out till the shirt is completely drenched in sweat. Overall it holds its own quite well in that department. However, the headband piece does tend to slip off a bit..In the end, don't recommend these for working out due to how tight it fits on your head over the course of an hour and a half. Then again everyone has different head sizes. My hat size is 7 1/2 so after 40 min I had to take these phones off...Pound for pound? At this price for all these phones do, definitely worth what you pay for.",1
5.0,Unbelievable specs and quality for the price.,"March 31, 2018",Yes,"Love these headphones! Look great, are super comfortable, and can't believe I can take phone calls on them! The sound is clear and loud, they are easy to fold up and put away, easy to pair with your phone or any blue tooth device. I got them to use at the gym and love that they are cordless. Wear a ponytail to keep them from slipping off backwards while you're active..Came with a nice velvet case, charging cord, instructions, and cord to connect to laptop or computer..The only issue I have is that the control buttons on the earpiece are too close together so I'll set off the phone when I want to change a song.",1
5.0,GREAT SOUND for a Fraction of the Price of Beats,"November 19, 2017",Yes,"These are my first Bluetooth headphones and I couldn’t be happier. The reviews are on right on the money. I can’t beliieve how clear they are. They range is terrific, particularly with the bass. I listened to all the Music Choice programs on Comcast (Xfinity X1box) and all styles of music were full and clear. Bass on the rock tunes should please every listener. I can’t imagine any headphones costing ten times more could sound ten times better. At $35, these have to be the best headphones in their class. So unless you need to have Beats for the style, these headphones will give you Great sound for a fraction of the price.",1
5.0,A friend of mine recommended the ear bud type headphones of this brand,"April 27, 2017",Yes,"These are the most badass pair of headphones. A friend of mine recommended the ear bud type headphones of this brand, but ear buds tend to fall out of my tiny ears. These had solid reviews and thankfully came in a color other than red/black, so I snatched them up! Awesome purchase. Sound quality is awesome. They fit over my ear, so they effectively cancel out noise unless someone were to come right up to me and speak. I don't think I could hear them if I had music playing. They also came with an AUX cord and charging cable but no wall plug. FYI And they came with a pretty sweet gray suede(?) carrying case! No complaints whatsoever. However, I should mention that I haven't had them long enough to test out the battery seeing as I only got them yesterday and would never want to wear them for 12+ hours.",60
3.0,Cord feature quit working after a month...UPDATE! 10/21/18,"October 2, 2018",Yes,"These are the 3rd pair of headphones I've bought my daughter this year. It seems like trying to find a decent quality pair of headphones with QUALITY cords that do not short/break is a hard task. The cords breaking/shorting out is the big problem.  Meanwhile, I have a pair of Koss headphones from the 1970's that work perfectly and still have the original cord, they're just ""too big"" according to my daughter. I'm in the process of returning these...any suggestions on headphones like these that don't break?.UPDATE 10/21/18- The seller reached out to me and sent a replacement, which I hope last. For that, I'll give them 3 stars, because I don't know if I'll have the same problem again. At least there is decent customer service.",0
5.0,Above and beyond making it right!  Paid it forward to the max!,"September 24, 2017",Yes,"Awesome sound, but wouldn't hold a charge more than 45 minutes and sometimes only 20.  So sad..Product update!: This awesome company replaced (free of charge; without my asking) the headphones and I am delighted.  There are always glitches in our world, things that just don't go right.  But these people made it right; they did the right thing and paid it forward.  I love that!  The headphones are AWESOME!  Fit snugly and I can hear nuances of sound I've never heard before in recording and phone (sometimes not what you want, but hey...) sounds.  Gaming is really immersive with these.  Love them and I've already bought for the grandsons.  Thanks!  A great company!",1
4.0,Amazing customer service!,"December 17, 2017",Yes,"I liked them while they lasted.

I'm amazed by their customer service!  I'll be sure to update again after they're charged and I'm able to use them some.",2
5.0,When he saw me with my red and black pair he wanted to borrow them but I was vehemently against lending them to a careless 13-year old so it made the perfect Christmas present,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"My son absolutely LOVES his headphones. When he saw me with my red and black pair he wanted to borrow them but I was vehemently against lending them to a careless 13-year old so it made the perfect Christmas present. I've seen the price go up and up over the months as more people have found out about them. My sister purchased two pairs off of my recommendation and I purchased 3 pairs in my house alone, so that we could all enjoy them. The quality is good and setup is a breeze. Every once in a while they may have a hiccup but it is pretty rare and I believe is just a characteristic of multiple Bluetooth devices sharing the same space. All in all a wonderful purchase that can be used with your phone, your computer or even a gaming system, either on Bluetooth or plugged in directly.",0
3.0,"Set up was pretty easy, as you just follow the instruction book","September 6, 2017",Yes,"I bought this product with the intention of using it with my PC for Gaming and other pc related things..The product came quickly and in the normal amazon packaging, it had all parts described in the details..Set up was pretty easy, as you just follow the instruction book..The sound quality is above-average for a Bluetooth headset but it doesn't really offer any surround sound capabilities..Furthermore, the mic only works with Bluetooth phone calls and not pc programs such as discord or Skype..Charge time is decent and range is actually pretty good..Overall, Good for lifestyle but not quite what I expected for my use.",1

So far they work great, only time will tell if these will fall victim to the same fate as their predecessors...Amending rating(s):.Seller: 5 stars.Product: 5 Stars* when material is new TBD..6 month Update:.Unit works great until the round power plastic button broke off from normal operation. It is the main button that is Held on by 3 small plastics pieces. Once these give out, the button falls off and the headphones no longer turn on- thus useless.

5.0,Great wireless and wired over ear headphone,"December 15, 2017",Yes,Very nice headphones. I bought these for my 11 year old daughter as a gift and she loves them. I tried them as well. The Bluetooth pairing works great with her Ipad Mini. Work well both wireless and wired which is why I bought these. Headphones seem to have very good build quality. Over the ear cushions are very comfortable. In fact my only minor complaint is that they work so well that they block surrounding noise and voices (sometimes my daughter can't hear us calling her right in the same room .. or at least she says she can't... lol) Paid $33.99 on Amazon. Great deal. Would buy these again no doubt.,1
1.0,Headphones don't work,"December 7, 2017",Yes,"I wanted these to work for me so bad. Bright green is one of my favorite colors. A read a lot of reviews on various headphones and I picked this one..The positive is they are very comfortable. The volume sounds really good (when it works)..I bought these because I fall asleep later than my husband and I don't want to keep him up so I use my tablet to watch TV.The light doesn't go off when it's on do it blinks every 30-60sec. In a dark room you notice it, so it sometimes bugs him, but I try to watch TV on the other side so you can't see the light..The sound in one ear would go in and out, but unfortunately now the sound doesn't work in one ear at all..I'm very sad, I need headphones really bad and now I don't have any thing to use. Disappointed in these. I expect things like headphones to last longer than a month.",7
5.0,My son is enjoying his games,"July 15, 2018",Yes,"I bought a Mpow H2 headphone that I loved the built, but it had a background noise in Bluetooth mode. I had to return and started to look for another Headphone. For my surprise, after I returned the defective H2, Mpow has contact me and offered to send a new one for another try. I immediately accepted, since I liked the quality of the product. It took some days and I got a new one. I had the chance to experiment now a perfect H2 and I can tell the sound is great and crisp and the EQ modes are perfect to adjust for music, movies, games, etc. I am feeling comfortable with them, even after several hours and the battery is lasting for 2 hours more than my previous headphone. Also the service from Mpow replacing for free my H2 was great...So as my wife wanted a new headphones for her fitness, I bought the Mpow Flame and she is loving to use in the fitness center. She says it is comfortable, the sound is great and the battery lasts. She is happy...Also my son wanted a Headphone for his games and I gave him the Mpow 059. He said the sound quality is great, clean and rich sound. I think the build quality is acceptable for this price of headphone and my son said they are adjustable enough to find perfect comfort position for hours of gaming...I can't be more happy with Mpow. Great products and great service.",0
4.0,"Large headphones, best quality for &lt; $60","September 20, 2017",Yes,"If you don't want to spend $60+ on headphones like me, these are the best you can buy on Amazon. Unfortunately, these headphones + Warby Parker glasses (they have huge ends that go behind your ears for some dumb reason) = pinched head on the side. You can adjust them around them with some effort but it's not super comfy. The headphones are big overall and I have a small head. Other than the glasses &amp; size issues the sound is great, the bluetooth pairing/tech side is great, and the battery seems great so far. And best of all, the price doesn't break my millennial-sized budget!..Pros: sound, cushion, price, battery, tech.Cons: big, can squash glasses",1
5.0,High Hopes That Fell Short  *update*,"March 9, 2018",Yes,"So after extensive research and reading through reviews, I bought this product a little over a month ago, at first I thought the sound was great, although I could hear outside noise it wasn’t too bad, the over the ear fit was really good and overall comfortable. HOWEVER I still had my old JBL pair and I compared the sound, it had SIGNIFICANT less sound quality, compared, it was ultra muffled with no bass, and when playing instrumentals you couldn’t hear the sound crisp or clear at all, the only reason I haven’t sent them back is because I took to long and my return window closed..***** UPDATE*****.So after my review was posted, I was contacted by customer service and they had let me know they sent a replacement, while not as loud as I hoped, the sound was so much better, as well as the some other added function that allows control over the way the sound is amplified, while the headphones they sent weren’t the ones being reviewed, I appreciate the effort and the product was better therefore I’m changing my review.",0
3.0,"Great bang for the buck, but will wear down over time","April 26, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphones in August 2017 after my previous set (which were about $100 more expensive) fell apart after just 2 months of everyday wear (!!). I figured I'd give these a go so I didn't waste my money again...For context, I don't consider myself an audiophile. I don't particularly care about that sort of thing, so I'm not sure how these compare to higher-end products or even other headphones--it all sounds the same to me unless it's outrageously bad. That being said, they're good headphones, and I really like them. I usually wear them at work (though not necessarily bluetooth the whole time) and on my commute (1.5 hours each way), and the battery lasts a few days with this use, which is impressive. They are excellent at cancelling out noise, a must for me, and very comfortable (I usually wear them 10+ hours/day, and I barely notice them, AND I wear glasses). The side controls are easy to use--mush easier than my pair of Mpow Swift bluetooth exercise headphones, which I was worried about since it's the same manufacturer. The collapsible ear pieces make them easy to transport--I took them with me on a 14-hour flight, and it was easy to pack them in my under-the-seat carry-on. The one downside is that the controls don't work while the cord is plugged in...Now for the cons. Recently the headphones have begun to falter. I realized that if I plug my headphones directly into my phone while at work, which I sometimes do, when I go to use the bluetooth feature again, it doesn't work at all, no matter how long I hold down the power button. (To be clear, this only started happening this week. Previously there were no issues with going from corded to bluetooth.) This is very annoying for two reasons: (1) I don't like walking with corded headphones--the cord just gets in the way--and it's a 2-mile walk to the train from my office; (2) I own an iPhone 7, so there's no separate headphone jack, meaning that I can't charge my phone and listen to music at the same time, a HUGE issue for me as my phone's old enough now that the battery will drop to 50% by the time I get to work. I wondered briefly whether I could just use the bluetooth the whole time and not have it be an issue, so when leaving for work I made sure I was at 100% battery. Unfortunately, about 3 hours into use, the headphones just cut off. No warning, no signal that the battery was low. Just suddenly stopped playing, disconnected, and wouldn't turn back on. So there went that theory...It's so disappointing as I really liked these headphones, especially when compared to my old pair. And these lasted much longer--9 months vs 2. Still, though, I feel like headphones should last AT LEAST a year before giving out.",1
3.0,"Not great, but try the H2 if you want comparable price and better sound.","November 10, 2017",Yes,"Based on how high and how many reviews there are for this product, I thought I'd give it a shot. These things are certainly attractive in person, but the piano black is a fingerprint magnet. They powered right up and paired quickly with my iPhone 7+. A lot of the reviews that buoyed up to the top mention the clear, crisp sound, but to me it's just tinny and flat. The headphones are definitely comfortable and fully enclosed my ears, but I could only detect bass once I'd shifted them to rest on top of my ears. While I'm no audiophile, these just aren't for me. The price is nice, but the sound quality left a fuzzy sound in my ears...Update: Patozon, the seller of these headphones sent me a set of the MPOW H2 headphone (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075DDXFJH) gratis. While this doesn't put a dent in my thoughts on this MPOW headset, the seller impressed me so I'm bumping the review up to 3 stars and will be leaving a 4-star review for the H2s.",1
1.0,Doesn't Charge,"August 26, 2018",Yes,"I bought this headset to replace an older pair I had that were a similar make and model. This pair doesn't charge half of the time, and when it does charge, it charges at such a painfully slow speed that it's not even worth using them. I would honestly not recommend the waste of money here. I genuinely thought that this product might have been charging incorrectly or something along those lines. Maybe the cable, maybe the port. Something like that. No, just half of the time, it will charge, the other half, nothing...Worth noting: The other pair I have is also the same make and model, but with a different brand name on the side. It doesn't hold a charge and I had it for 1 year.",1
1.0,Does not work!!!,"August 23, 2017",Yes,"I bought these headsets for my wife. These headphones looked very nice for the price.  The first time we paired it with phone, it worked well and the sound quality was good for this price range. But the second time we tried pairing it with the phone, we did not hear any audio even though it kept saying the that it was connected to phone1.  After switching it off and on for several times we were able to hear the audio but then again when you pause the music or switch off the headset, and pair again you dont hear anything.  Tried it for few more days, because of all the positive reviews but had the same problem over and over again. Had to keep switching it on and off and pairing it and once it a while we could hear the audio.",3
4.0,I am an audiophile but I don't have audiophile money...,"July 7, 2017",Yes,"I wish I could drop buckets on an expensive pair of headphones but that's just not feasible at the moment. However, I still want something that sounds nice. I was a bit skeptical about these in the beginning because I felt like all of the reviews were fake. However, these really aren't that bad for their price. No, the bass is not the best but it's not terrible and it's better than other headphones I've bought. All in all, these sound very crisp and clean. I ride public transportation and while I can still hear what's going on around me, the cups do a good job at sealing out some noise so I can still hear my music clearly. Speaking of which, my ears must be small because they fit completely within the earpad. They're very comfortable to wear. They're also very well made. They don't feel like plastic, they feel very sturdy and I feel like the money was well spent. These are a good buy if you're in the market for cheap, but well sounding headphones. Would reccomend. The reviews are not entirely fake.",1
4.0,Watch that cord...,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"These were for my son but I steal them on occasion to use when I mow the grass.  He rarely remembers to charge them but they work great when they are charged.  When not charged you have to use the cord.  The inserts for the phone / earphone are not well made and bend easily.  A slight bend will obviously create static or loss of sound in the ear phones.  I first realized this when I was mowing and my phone was in my pocket., the attachment bent slightly (the metal piece stayed straight in the phone and the plastic piece over bent slightly outside the phone) and sound was lost.  I bent it back and it was fine, I just have to be careful with it.",1
5.0,Not enough volume.,"April 14, 2018",Yes,"Build was ok but the volume was not nearly loud enough. I returned them for a refund. If the volume would’ve been as loud as the lady who tells you you’re at max volume, it would’ve been ok. Very disappointed. My hearing is fine by the way..UPDATE 07MAY2018; I received an email from Bella at Patozon customer service. I’m upgrading to 5 stars because of their customer service. After reading my initial review, they contacted me and sent me a new pair. Not many retailers will do this so I want to give kudos to Bella and her customer service team. Number One!",1
5.0,and these are great. Range is good,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"I use these at work and couldn't be more surprised at how well they work..I just wanted something cheap that could play music without bothering co-workers, and these are great..Range is good, Sound quality is great for the price..Battery lasts a stupid amount of time, like I'm not sure how the batter lasts as long as it does, but this sucker just doesn't die..for $35 this is an awesome deal..-Also, I can connect my Phone and PC to this at the same time without issues, So I don't miss any alerts or notifications.",1
5.0,"Sounds good, great battery life and really good bluetooth range","October 30, 2018",Yes,"I initially had a problem with the first headset of the 2 that I ordered. I know that things happen with all devices no matter how good the quality is. Out of frustration and thinking that I was stuck with them I gave a 1 star.....I ended up writing them but didn't receive a message about a replacement but totally unexpected,  I received a replacement set almost 2 weeks later to my surprise and this pair is a really good set and sounds really good for the money, good bt range and the battery lasts almost 20 hours of continuous music. So far so good with both sets.",1
1.0,"Good Build Quality, Terrible Sound Quality","September 26, 2018",Yes,"I ordered these after seeing that they had over 15k positive reviews (now down to 8k, I guess amazon deleted some fake reviews). They are well built and very comfortable. However, I was extremely disappointed by the sound quality. They sound like $5 bargain bin headphones, blanketed and hollow, with poor range. I didn't expect such poor sound from such a highly rated product.",3
1.0,Had high hopes but disappointed,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"I’ve only had them a few days and I’m already experiencing issues. Issues so bad I can’t wear them:.1. The sound in the right ear is way lower than the left ear. It’s been like that since the day I received them. I can barely hear out of the right ear..2: They heat up very fast. I’m not talking an hour or so of use, my pair heats up after 10 minutes of use. The headphones get so hot I have to take them off..3: The padding is very stiff and hard making them uncomfortable on the skin..4: They are very very uncomfortable. My heads not that big yet they squeezed on my jawbone (by the ears) so bad I couldn’t wear them longer than a few minutes. My jaw was hurting for quite sometime afterwards..I don’t know if I received a defective pair but they are NOT worth the money. Im disappointed because MPOW usually has good products. This is not one of those good products.",1
5.0,Only fair headphones (059) but GREAT customer service,"December 4, 2017",Yes,Seemed a little flimsy. the headband did not curve enough inward so the bottom of the ear cup did not make contact with my head under the ear. This let in a lot of outside sound.  The bluetooth did pair easily and the sound was just ok...Update: The seller promptly refunded my purchase price on these headphones and then sent me another pair for my evaluation. I have not fully evaluated them yet but I would trust the seller to make good on any product they sell if they stand behind them like they did on this one..Here are the ones they sent me:..https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0777P577D,1
4.0,Not the best for bass.,"August 21, 2018",Yes,"You get what you pay for. They're definitely durable, but only thing about them is the sound isn't the best. Bass isn't deep, it's subpar. They do me well when I play games and in the gym, but for music, not the best choice. Would go with something slightly more expensive to get a rich bass sound.",2
3.0,I really wanted to like it,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"I own a pair of in-ear Mpow Jaws bluetooth headphones (which I love) but wanted an over-the-ear one with optional wired connection for home use.  These seemed to fit the bill.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the sound.  The heaviness of the bass tends to drown out other sounds and everything sounds a bit muffled when compared to my Samsung wired headset that came with my phone.  It's too bad because the product itself feels and fits great.  These headphones are very comfortable indeed which is why it pains me to return them...On a side note, the seller was very helpful during the whole process.  They sent me a replacement unit and offered to replace that as well if I wasn't satisfied. They went above and beyond to ensure I was as happy as possible.  I recommend buying from this seller (Patozon).",0
5.0,Awesome,"September 18, 2018",Yes,"Great quality, sound is great, and battery works for a long time. I have used it mainly for doing yard work, watching movies on ipad, and working out. I’ve used it for extended amounts of time before recharging (even forgetting to plug it in). Quick charge time...Update: Around 11 months after extended use, the volume button got stuck so you can’t adjust the volume. Still sounds great. Minor adjustment to control it on phone. Still best headset.",1
3.0,I do like that it folds in and the company actually caring about their customers,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"They are just meh. Over an hour of use the cusion on the to of my head starts to hurt from it constant pressure, the Bluetooth on these headsets are okay. But if you have your music in your pocket you'll get a lot of stutters and hacks in the audio that just reins the some. I do like that it folds in, has great battery and can use it as a PS4 headset. B but the strength in the Bluetooth headset bothered me to much...This company does the right steps and actually cares about their customers. To my surprise they shipped me a new headset to try and I wish I could review it as for me it would be a 5 star. I don't want my review to be biased as I'm reviewing the ones that I bought and I would highly recommend buying from this company. You have all my respect and attention.",0
3.0,"Great Quality, but not for Xbox.","February 19, 2018",Yes,"I had bought this to try and seek an alternative to the TurtleBeach. The sound is great, good range and clarity for music. Tried the voice, that was an upset. I have a BT Transmitter and paired the devices. The sound from the xbox was clear but no voice. The transmitter has three options for input. A 3.5mm jack, an optical, or a coaxial. I tried all of those and still no voice. So I skipped the whole reason for this headset and tried a wired connection. Nope, still no voice. So I had thought the mic was broken, and tried voice by phone. What a surprise. It worked. Now I regret the purchase somewhat, but I'll still use them. The quality is rather good, sound and structure. But it's not for xbox. (I think its the transmitter) Hope this helps;)",1
5.0,Go ahead and get these headphones!,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"I bought these headphones for my husband to use. He uses them on the lawn mower and while exercising. They fit around the ear nicely and are highly adjustable. My husband does have a big head and they still fit comfortably. The only complaint I would have is it is a little tricky trying to figure out how to cut the headphones off as this is the same button that connects your Bluetooth. He absolutely loves the headphones and I can say I highly recommend these headphones. The battery last good and the sound quality is great. If you wanted to have a lot of bass you can, but also works good on older songs and Rock. Highly recommended!",1
1.0,"After less than a year they are dead, will not charge","September 30, 2018",Yes,"Initially I was excited about these headphones. They sound really good and feel comfortable on your head and ears. However, I bought them around November of last year and only used them a handful of times as I use them while I travel.  It has been about 6 months since the last time I used them. I pulled them out to charge before my upcoming trip and now they will not charge. I can plug them in and power them on, but the battery is completely depleted.  I am completely appalled that after about 6 uses I now have a pair of headphones that lasted less than the crap you could pick up at any knock off store.  I would look elsewhere if you want something that will last. Clearly I was duped having forgot that you get what you pay for.",0
5.0,Not Beats but a great replacement,"August 26, 2018",Yes,Brought these for my daughter to replace her Beats (someone sat on em) these are no Beats but for the cost and quick fix i give em a try. Her only complaint is the Beats sound better but not a deal breaker. These are her 1st Bluetooth pair and she's not great at charging things before they NEED to be but these have the option to be hard wired .but these hold a charge very well i don't believe she has use the wire yet. I asked her if she wanted some new Beats she said nope these are her favorite pair.......someone gave her a compliment on how they look I'm quite sure this has something to do with them being her favorite. She's off to first year of college I'll give a update on Christmas break...,0
5.0,"These are super comfortable, have a pretty good sound (not a ...","May 9, 2018",Yes,"These are super comfortable, have a pretty good sound (not a lot of bass though), a good mic, have a decent battery life, and are really affordable.  The noise isolation is what you would expect, it drowns out ambient sounds but active noises such as people talking are definitely audible.  So far the only issue I have is the bass, but since I mostly listen to podcasts, playing games, or using them to make calls, this hasn't bothered me at all, mostly because they are just so damn comfortable..I would highly recommend these if you just want to use them to watch movies, play games, listen to light music or podcasts, and make voip calls. Especially at the current price.  However, you may want to look elsewhere if you want some deep base or are working with sound software, but then again if you are looking for that I don't imagine you are looking at a $40 headphones to begin with.",0
5.0,I really liked these for several reasons - comfort,"March 17, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE!! This GREAT COMPANY replaced my faulty unit - what a nice surprise to have it show up at my house! I didn't feel right ASKING but they just did it. Just in time for my finals training for some 10 mile runs! Working great now. Now I hope to add a slightly smaller set of phones to my closet o running gear - they will be MPOWs.  I am trying to figure out why these keep cutting out every 10 seconds or so, following two beeps but no luck. Fully charged, they won't stop doing this. I really liked these for several reasons - comfort, connectivity, and easy controls int eh right spot, but the ear pieces are a bit big - which I can live with - but the cutting out is driving me nuts and this is with either my nano or iPod. No information available as to why. Well made, light weight enough.",0
5.0,My wife loves them!,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"This headset was bought for my wife, since she hates being tethered to her laptop using a chord. She wears glasses and loves the feeling of the headset when on, since it doesn't make her ears hurt after a short time and doesn't dig the frame of her glasses into the side of her head (she wears thick frames, too, so it's really hard to find a headset that DOESN'T do that). The sound is great, though it is VERY audible to those around you if it's not fairly quiet, but that doesn't bother her since she doesn't listen to it loud anyway. The battery life is great, the menu on the earphone is easy to function, and the plastic of the product is actually really sturdy...Worth the cost, and definitely recommend it for someone who doesn't want to spend $100 on a pair of bluetooth headphones that are quality.",0
2.0,Uncomfortably heavy and sized for big heads or low ears.,"April 20, 2018",Yes,"These were so uncomfortable I could barely sit through a single movie with them on.  I always thought I had an average sized head.  But adjusted at the most compact, I really needed to put a foam block between the top of my head the the headphones to stop it from hurting both my head and my ears.  I can't believe anyone would have to adjust them longer than the most compacted size.  I even tried wearing them upside down.  But the fact that these were so heavy (12 oz) meant they couldn't merely float on my ears but would fall until the top of the headband rested (weighed) on the top of my head and pulled at my ears.  I am returning them and trying different styles.  In addition to earbuds and retro (Walkman-style) headphones, there are over the ear headphones at half the weight of these.",0
4.0,"Good headphones, not SO good noise isolation","January 18, 2018",Yes,"Bought these headphones because I wanted a really good *and affordable* pair of over the ear headphones for studying and just day to day activities, and I am very pleased with my purchase. I really liked that they came with their own carrying pouch (which you can put it in once you fold it down). I have had no problems with connecting it to Bluetooth, but I love that there is an option to still used the wired aux cable. These headphones are relatively lightweight and fit very comfortably over my ears. The sponge around each side is very breathable and doesn't make the area around your ears sweaty (like some other over the ear headphones). I like the controls on one of the ear pieces which allows you to take calls, pause, fast forward and control the volume. It also comes with a built in mic which I have had no problems with when making phone calls. Another thing is that I am able to wear my glasses without much discomfort...One negative thing I would say is that the noise cancelation could be better. It does a decent job at blocking outside noise, but you are still able to hear certain things.I don't mind this, because again it still does a good job overall. Another thing I would note is that it will look a little big/bulky on your ears but nothing too much where it looks crazy.",1
4.0,Good sound quality with some complaints,"January 23, 2018",Yes,"Originally made a five star review, but took it down to four. The thing that connects the headphones to the audio jack got messed up within a month, so I have to hold it at an angle. My cats didn't even touch it!..As for the wireless features, they're kinda meh. It makes this annoying background static and has a blue light blinking constantly when it's connected via bluetooth. You can't wear these in a dark environment (e.g., on a plane) due to the blinking light. I covered up the power button with a sticker and it seems to be a good solution.",1
5.0,Remarkable headphones for the price,"March 5, 2018",Yes,"I was not sure what I was going to get ordering these, but I wasn't expecting my favorite headphones to date. They're heavier and sturdier than I expected. The controls are simple, but it took me a while to realize where they were because they weren't on the edge like I'm used to. The ear cups are gloriously soft and actually wide enough not to press on my earrings (I have nine holes in my ear, so they don't like a lot of pressure). The sound quality is great, though I do wish it had a bass boost (not really a big deal, just me having been spoiled by skullcrushers once upon a time). All functions (phone call, wireless playback, wired playback) have worked as well as or better than expected. I like the announcer voice...All in all, I've been incredibly happy with these so far.",0
2.0,Good value if you're not picky,"January 18, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are fairly comfortable, the ears adjust slightly to fit your head. The padding is soft on your head, but I have a larger head which means the headphones are pressing pretty hard against the sides of my head. At first it gave me headaches. It did decrease over time but it's still not the most comfortable experience. I noticed a bit of connectivity issues with my headphones, especially when I have multiple devices paired...These are definitely ""value"" headphones - it's like getting the value meal at a fast food place. It's an unbeatable price, but you have to sacrifice some quality. You're definitely going to lose some sound quality with these. When you're listening to music, especially music that's a little more bass-heavy, it sounds a bit like you're listening in a bubble.",1
5.0,Loooove them!!,"September 9, 2018",Yes,"I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality in every aspect of these headphones. I’ve been using Beats earphones for years, and I got quite accustomed to the sound of being IN a concert, but having the noise-canceling feature on these coupled with the wonderfully comfortable pads makes them nice to wear instead of having something sticking in my ears.  And the sound quality is quite surprising, considering the low price.",1
3.0,"Decent headphones nothing flashy, no ANC","February 2, 2018",Yes,"These are good over the ear headphones. There is nothing flashy about these they work well but don't expect them to sound as good as a top end pair of headphones. Look they cost $35 not $350. You are not getting that deep base nor the highs. They fit well with glasses, they sound ok via Bluetooth or the included 3.5 mm cable. My Cowin 7's sound better and have a deeper base. They paired easy but turning them off requires pressing the button for about 8 seconds, they eventually will tell you they are powering down. For $35 they are a decent pair of headphones.",1
5.0,A new set of headphones for me,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"I had been having trouble setting the earbuds of another headphone in my ears, and decided to look for a pair that fit over the ears.  After seeing the reviews, I decided to buy a pair.  It sounded better than I expected.  When I use them to listen to music, it is clear, not showing any distortion, sounding as if I'm listening to it live.  When watching videos on my Kindle, you can not only hear the sounds of the voices, but the background sounds, as well.  It gives a much more realistic feel to the video.  It keeps outside sounds down, so you are not disturbed by others.  With that being said, they are also comfortable, albeit wearing them for an extended period of time will cause some minor discomfort.  Usually no more than an hour, or so.  I need to experiment with linking the headphones to my smartphone, and seeing how they work, being used during a phone call.  All in all, these headphones are really well made, and will give you hours of listening pleasure.",1
5.0,A really good value,"August 1, 2017",Yes,"I was very skeptical about these but after reading all of the reviews and looking at other headphones, the price kept me coming back to this set.  I mean these are under $50 and they look great.  I went ahead and ordered and was actually very happy with how easy they were to pair to my iPhone 7 Plus.  The sound quality.  My only complaint is, as these are over the ear headphones, my ears seem to barely fit so if you have large ears then keep that in mind.  I'm assuming these were engineered more to fit kids than a 40-year-old guy like myself.  Overall, I just needed these for fun every so often so for the price I am pretty happy with the value.",1
4.0,Comfy but can get hot,"April 19, 2018",Yes,"Since we have headphones that connect to the TV at home, I bought these to connect with my Amazon Fire TV Stick. They work really well! I wear glasses, and they're perfectly comfy. And the cups are large enough to fit around my whole ear, which cancels out background noise pretty well...My only complaints are that my ears get hot &amp; sweaty if I wear them for an extended amount of time because the ear cups aren't breathable (such as the headphones I use with my PS4, which are mesh); and occasionally my hair will get caught in one of the creases (where they fold for storage, where they are adjustable for head size, and where the ear cups are attached to the headband)...Overall, I would definitely recommend these! They're affordable, comfy, and very easy to use.",0
3.0,"An OK headest, here is what to expect","January 7, 2018",Yes,"1. It's not the most comfortable set of headphones. Expect to have a lot of pressure on your ears. You will need to remove them every now and then (this is more or less mentioned in the instruction manual)..2. I am not familiar with the general quality of Bluetooth headphones. But if I were to compare it with ANY headphone then its not the best headset you can buy IN GENERAL. It's probably an OK headphone for the price, do not expect anything out of this world..3. OK sound quality: not a great base, some static noise and a definite issue with snares.",2
5.0,Exactly what I needed,"November 26, 2017",Yes,"Bought these with a Bluetooth transmitter to play video games while my GF studies and they work great for this. At work, in addition to keeping me sane while performing mundane tasks, they work really well to protect my ears when doing loud things like blowing off parts with air or drilling holes in concrete. Battery life has been completely awesome. They aren't super awesome audiophile headphones, but if you aren't focusing on the music than these are as good as anything else. If you break them, you are only out $30 or whatever. Build and feel is really surprisingly good for the price.",1
3.0,Poor Audio Quality - No Bass and Hollow,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"I am very disappointed in this purchase. I went with what the other reviews were saying, but in the end, the sound quality of these headphones is terrible. There is almost no bass and it sounds like the music is coming out of a hollow tunnel very far away. Doesn't matter how comfortable they are or how long the battery life is, the number one purpose of headphones is to deliver a quality music experience, and these fail miserably. I have already started the return process. I do NOT recommend this as a purchase, unless of course you miss the transistor radio sound from the 70s...Update 5/21/2018: Even though I didn't care for the product, the customer support has been outstanding. They were genuinely concerned about the review I left and sent me another complimentary product. Customer service was a 5-star rating.",0
5.0,Returning them,"September 30, 2018",Yes,"Really, REALLY, wanted for these to work. Especially after having invested too much time narrowing down the list of best budget over-ear headphones (and these were it)...Why am I sending them back?.Don’t get me wrong, these produce EXCELLENT sound quality that is impressive, really, but I’m NOT trying to share the music I’m listening to with everyone in the same room as me. Sure, you can have the music level up to the middle range before sound begins to badly bleed—but at this level, you can’t fully appreciate the headphones’ sound output because at this level you will still be able to hear every aspect of your background noise...They CAN block out background noise quite well, but you’ve got to either be in a quieter environment, or have your volume on high (and conscientious of your environment as a result)...This isn’t solely an Mpow 059 problem, but rather a sub-$50 over-ear headphones one...If you’re on a budget and don’t mind your music bleeding out, these are for you. Again, their sound quality is really commendable, and these actually mask background noise supremely well when the volume is near max-high level (I never even got to max out the volume because of how loud these can get)...I’ll instead be opting for quality earbud headphones for now until I’ve got the capital for higher tier over-ear ones...10/21/18 Update.Looking back, for the price, you are actually getting 5-star headphones. For this reason, and Mpow having exceptional, highly commendable, customer service, I give this the 5 stars it deserves.",0
3.0,Ouch! Update: Patozon's customer service blew me away!,"December 19, 2017",Yes,"I really wanted to like these, my husband got them for me for my birthday. New headphones to run with. While they stay on my head just fine and have great sound quality, they push into my jaw bones and hurt so bad. I do have a smaller sized head, but the cushions push right on the jaw hinge right in front of my ear and it seriously gave me a headache for hours! Not to mention the jaw pain also...Update:.Patozon reached out after reading my comment with their above and beyond customer service. They were sad that I wasn't able to enjoy these headphones, so they sent me their other model- the H1. After receiving them and testing them out, I love them! They are the perfect solution if the 059 headphone are too tight on your head. The H1 headphones are soft, light, sound great, and most importantly- are comfortable!!! I love that they can skip songs, pause songs, turn the volume up and down, take calls, reject calls, and even use Siri to make a call for you! Very impressed!",1
5.0,"A freaking mazing, I love them","August 14, 2017",Yes,"If you're looking for hardcore bass these aren't the ones, but if you're okay with voice and background in a harmony balanced way these are the perfect choice. Loud enough to zone out and not hear other people or ellipticals or other equipment. They fit over my ears and are extremely comfortable. All the buttons are easily labeled and they work perfectly. It has a voice that tells you when powered on and off. Paired with my phone in about  6 seconds, just hold and wait for the blue and red swirl then open Bluetooth on whatever device and scan. They're perfect. The only thing you have to worry about is forgetting they are wireless lol I keep taking my phone everywhere and trying to move an invisible wire haha. But these are a steal considering most other wireless headphones go to 70 and up. These deliver, I am so ecstatic I purchased them.",1
5.0,Excellent  VALUE,"August 15, 2018",Yes,"I am a producer and own dozens of headphones in all price ranges. I bought these basically 1) a sale I saw in my news feed and 2) I had heard they were a pretty good deal for the money..I was looking for Bluetooth cans with decent sound and good connectivity. In this price range I own some Kinovos (sp?) (good connectivity but uncomfortable) and Corwin (again sp?) E7's (look nice, sound decent, not too comfortable but |&gt;horrible&lt;| connectivity-the worst ever BT range actually &gt;for me&lt;). The Corwins are just ""OK"" for close connections like iPad or phone. My 4 year old has a pair of Disney BT headphones that have better BTooth...These MPOW headphones don't stand up to my best studio phones (Beyer Dynamic ~$300) but for 30 bucks they are an AMAZING deal-sound good and comfortable for inexpensive gear. The best part; excellent Bluetooth from iPad and phone and PC. Cosmetically, the red looks a little ""gamer cheesy"" but so what -LOL-.Good buy..Peace-Stareye",0
5.0,Highly recommend - Comfortable - Work well,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"I've been using these for 2 weeks and LOVE them. I use them when I'm at work for one to block out some extra noise but of course to listen to music/audio and for skype calls. I've had no issue and they were easy to pair. I do wear glasses while I'm at work and there is absolutely no discomfort / issue with the headphones. The padding is so soft. The only thing is sometimes I get them to power straight off and othertimes it will only disconnect then turn off several minutes later. Either way, I can go all day using them and not have a battery issue. I do try to charge them once a day out of habit but have not had them die yet. I also love the case they come in so I can protect them when I throw them in my backpack at the end of the day and keep the cords with them. Highly recommend - great price.",0
5.0,Great Price and Even Better Headphones!,"June 26, 2018",Yes,"These are a great pair of headphones regardless of the price (the price is just a bonus in my opinion). I love these things! I wear them around the house and when I go out for walks on my lunch break. The sound is fantastic -- I often find myself picking up little nuances in my music that I didn't hear before. I have never tried on a pair of Beats or other high-end wireless headphones, but I can't imagine the sound being any better than what these output...Additionally, these are really comfortable and the fold up in a manner that doesn't appear like they will break anytime soon (I have had folding earphone in the past and have typically shied away from them because they break easily...these don't seem like they would have that problem). The range is pretty good on these as well; at home, I typically leave my phone or tablet on a charger and can get around most of the house without losing the connect (even into the basement)...I have been pleased with all the MPOW items I have purchased -- I have a pair of in-ear wireless headphones that I use when I work out and they are great too!",0
5.0,The tech far outways the price: A+,"October 21, 2017",Yes,"I really enjoy these headphones. Mostly, I use them for long runs, and they stay where I put them... on my ears so I can hear my music, fitness tracker, and take phone calls. I’ve tried so many ear buds and they all eventually slip out or need adjusting especially once I’m sweaty...The sound quality is good, especially for what I’m doing.  I even use them when I mow my lawn...double as hearing protection(not official) and music.  No, they are not high-end studio or Bose; but for what you get in this headset for the price... I feel the customer profits more than the seller!..By the way, it connects to my phone almost instantly when I power them on. No searching, no fumbling with the phone’s Bluetooth settings. Lace up, music playlist, headphones on, hit play... and go! Makes my running allot more enjoyable when not having to reposition or stop to fix my music.  Stays put when using a weight bench too...The buttons are easy to use, and conveniently organized with volume control, next song, last song, and Siri...Only confusing aspect, until I got to know my headset better, is when I go to power them off: you have to hold the button until the voice says it’s off.  It goes through a series of function when powering off that use the same “hold the button down” function. So don’t freak out and try to fix it like I did. Just hold the button until it performs the function you want...Also tried it with my Echo, Apple TV, and PS4... handled all with ease.",0
4.0,Connecting to a TV,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"This is a GREAT headset for the money. The only problem I had was figuring out how to pair it with my bluetooth enabled TV.  The instructions included were worthless!  Luckily, folks who have figured out how to do this post ""how to"" videos on YouTube.  Seems I had to go to the ""sound"" option on my TV and select ""change speaker"" and have my TV scan for available bluetooth devices. I was then able to easily pair the headset with my TV.  The only downside is I must select the Mpow each time I want to listen via my headset.  Not the worst problem though.",1
4.0,Great deal on a good set of wireless headphones,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"When I ordered these headphones, I initially was primarily looking for a wired set. After seeing the price on this set and reading the reviews though, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The MPOW-59s are a surprisingly decent set of headphones without spending a fortune. When I unboxed them, the first thing that stood out to me was the shiny black plastic on the exterior, which looks kind of cheap. Honestly, and this is strictly nitpicking as well as my own opinion, I think a matte finish would have looked much better and not clashed as bad with the matte red on the interior of the pair I ordered. Other than that small gripe which others may not even see as a negative, I have been extremely happy with the set thus far. They pair easy to a computer or phone, and they have a decent range to them as well. I tested how far away I could get in my admittedly small house by leaving my phone to stream Spotify to the headphones while I went in another room, closed the door, and even then they still managed to keep connected, albeit with drops in quality and some skipping. Audio quality seems to be nice even when connected via Bluetooth. I have not yet used the included cable to try them wired, but it's nice that they included it. The headphones are pretty comfortable, with generous sizing on the cups and a nice padding around them. They fit me just fine, and I feel like they would fit just about anybody as long as you don't have huge ears or a massive head. All in all, a great deal on a good set of wireless headphones.",1
2.0,"That button on the side is supposed to do everything, but the problem is knowing WHERE on that button you have to press!!","April 5, 2018",Yes,"Not a fan. There is one button which is supposed to turn the thing on/off, connect to Bluetooth, skip a track, turn the volume up/down... But it's one big button and you're supposed to just feel where you're supposed to touch the thing for a certain outcome. It's not efficient. Also, the sound quality is not great. These feel kinda cheap. They fit tightly and the muffs are nice and snug. But I would say these are maybe a good buy at $17. But at this price point, though not expensive, these are not easy to keep around. They stay on at the gym and you can skip songs easily... BUT... you can't quite connect quickly and if you press the button, you could be maybe disconnecting. You don't really know...Not into lack of clarity in tech products.",0
5.0,Replacement is perfect!,"June 1, 2018",Yes,I went with the 059 because I liked the look and it had a ton of great reviews but the set I got creaks in the left ear any time I move my head. It's just the plastic on plastic but it very annoying and can be heard inside the headset even when playing music. Also not sure if I like the way it fits my head as I feel like I'm constantly having to adjust it. Music sounds great and it synced up easily but I'll probably return it and try another brand...Update: I returned the product and received a free replacement and the previous issue is no longer a problem. Now they are perfect. Thank you customer service at Mpow!,1
5.0,GREAT FOR DOZING-NICE SOUND!,"May 16, 2018",Yes,"Wow, these are super comfortable.  I was looking for a headset that I could use to fall asleep with;  unlike my spouse, I cannot fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow. I often listen to TV shows even with the screen off just to relax before I doze off. Also, when traveling, sometimes a room is just too quiet and I need a little bit of sound to be able to sleep. The nice thing is these don't extinguish all noise so if there were to be an emergency of some kind, I would still be able to hear. In other words, I'm not absolutely comatose. These headphones are comfortable enough to wear for hours and quiet when you move about on the pillow so that you don't disturb your spouse. Great headset all the way around! BAMAPAT",0
5.0,Absolutely Fantastic,"June 6, 2017",Yes,"These are absolutely fantastic. I bought these to use at the gym, since having chords is annoying when lifting weights or having them bounce around when you run. I also use these at work to drown out the sound of my loud coworkers who are on the phone all day long...Pros:.The pairing process is very simple.They were delivered quickly and without damage.They block out sound.They are very comfortable.They fold in half and are adjustable..Cons:.The side controls are a little hard to use, it would have been helpful if there were some raised dots or something to help feel what button you are pushing.There isn't a way to see how much charge is left on the device",8
2.0,You get what you pay for.,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"Around the ear? Who's ear? Pretty small and tight, wouldn't want to wear for too long. When first turning it on. The ""powering on"" voice over has some static. All other voice overs seem to be fine. Speakers sound ok but expected a little louder.. Buttons on side have no brail to figure out what you're pressing. I chose this because of battery play time. But I plan on getting a different one to fit in ears with noise cancelling. Less bulk and hopefully more comfortable than this...I've only heard of ""on-ear"" and ""around-ear"". ""Over-ear"", is a new one to me. I assumed it meant around ear. Don't assume. I read all the reviews, I seen no mention of it being small and uncomfortable. I wish I could return them.",0
5.0,The wireless set was extremely easy to hook up and is very convenient when exercising,"July 21, 2017",Yes,I use these about an hour or more a day for working out.  The wireless set was extremely easy to hook up and is very convenient when exercising.  The headphones stay securely on my head during low impact cardio and strength training.  They are quite comfortable (I cannot wear many headsets)and the sound quality is great for the price...Of course I sweat when wearing these as they fit securely next to my ears and one sweats when working out.  They still look brand new even after enduring several weeks on my sweat and being wiped by a low grade cleaner (to avoid being smelly) on a daily basis...I am in love with these headphones and highly recommend them.,1
4.0,4.5 Stars. Worthy For The Price,"July 25, 2017",Yes,"I've spent a substantial amount of time searching for the right bluetooth headphones over the past year. I don't want a pair of $200 Bose headphones that I will have to worry about. I just want something that works well for the price...While these headphones aren't perfect, they are close given their price.  I wish i could give them a 4.5 Star...Pro's.-For The money, haven't found another to compare in quality.-Decent sound. It's not Bose quality, but it's not bad. I don't need perfect sound. For the price you won't be disappointed.  I tried my friend's $60 Skull Candy Headphones and thought these were higher quality and more balanced..-They stay on well, are super comfortable and block out just enough sound.  I enjoy wearing them at work when I need to focus, even just as earmuffs sometimes to muffle a little noise.  Plus, less colleagues bother me when I need to concentrate because you they can see you wearing them!.-I go on runs with these all the time and they work great.  They are well built and have an industrial extension feature similar to the quality on Beats head phones. They get a little sweaty, but what do you expect?  You're wearing headphones. Any pair will.  It doesn't bother me..-overall the fit is often. I wear these in the car to use as a Bluetooth phone and many hours a day at work.  They fit well and stay in place...Cons.-.There is a small muffled rattle when I run in them. I don't mind it but it is there. It sounds like a press fit piece that isn't quite snug..-As stated before, don't expect $150 sound.  They are definitely comparable to some headphones twice their price, but you won't get Bose acoustics from them...Yes, I would recommend them.  If you found my review helpful please let me know!",1
5.0,Very Happy (but I'm not an audiophile),"August 11, 2017",Yes,"Very happy with these headphones and the price! I use them mainly for listening to TV (with ARCHEER Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter and Receiver sold on Amazon) and audio books. The sound is rich and full. I'm not an audiophile so can't review on the highs, lows, etc., but the sound is very clear and much better than my wired inexpensive Sony headphones (which I liked until I got these).  I like that they have an auxiliary cable so I can use with my laptop, too. I haven't run out of battery yet and use them hours at a time. I have a small head and they are a little big for me, but not by much. They feel substantial, giving me hope they will last a reasonable length of time. The pouch is an added bonus.",1
5.0,Great Value,"October 29, 2017",Yes,"Love these ear phones.  I bought them to use when I am sitting for hours receiving treatment at an infusion center where it can get fairly noisy.  I can hear my music clearly, but I can also hear what is going on around me in the background.  I need to be able to hear what's around me in background because the nurses come to talk to me from time to time.  I now use these cordless bluetooth earphones all the time.  Headband is soft and easy to adjust.  Controls on the right earphone are easy to use.  The system pairs very easily to my iPhone, iPad, MacBook and iMac (only one at a time, however).  Sound is good.  It's not great (after all, you are only paying about $40) but it is quite good enough for casual listening.  Audiophiles will not be satisfied.  Mere mortals will be fine.  Great value for money.  No hesitation on this one.",0
5.0,ALL PROS,"December 8, 2017",Yes,"If you see some good reviews and some bad reviews and are not sure which ones to believe, this is one of those that you should believe! I was not expecting a lot from these headphones because of the price point. BUT boy was I wrong. I have used these headphones for everything, music, blocking out some noise when trying to sleep, watching netflix. These headphones: the sound clarity is amazing, the bluetooth is effective with a good range, they fold and are so more compact, the ear pieces are comfortable, the buttons are useful and can be used easily to adjust volume etc. These are such a good buy for the money!!!!",1
4.0,Poor sound quality.,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"Well constructed and surprisingly comfortable. Sound quality is not so good..Understably the blue tooth sound is pretty weak but wired you can really hear  big gaps between many frequencies especially in the Lower ranges. Very steppy, gappy and annoying. The lowest frequencies step all over creating a muddy back ground. Some Playlists sound so off I couldn’t immediately recognize them..Update as of 5/27/18. The company sent me a replacement headset the H2 version. I didn't ask for a replacement they just sent one..Pretty comfortable ear phones but not as comfortable as the original 059 version I ordered. I wear glasses and live in a noisy environment and had those parameters in mind with the first order but the H2 does not cover the ear entirely cancelling out ambient noise and not squishing the ear into the glasses like the 059. The sound quality however is much more seemless. They sound a lot like regular earbuds, nothing special, kind of flat but it is a smooth consistent acoustic experience. The Equalizer function on the unit they sent does not work however..I gave another star for their effort at customer service. Thank you Patozan.",0
5.0,Work and feel very well.,"September 11, 2017",Yes,"I hooked the headphones up yesterday. Initially I did have a little trouble pairing them to a Mpow Streambot bluethooth transmitter. On the third try pairing they did connect. If I turn them and the transmitter off they will automatically reconnect then the transmitter and headphones are turned back on...Good clarity and sound quality. I like the fact that they give a ""voice prompt"" when you turn power on, during pairing, reach maximum volume or turn off the headset. That to me is a real nice feature. They are very comfortable and block out ambient noise pretty well...Overall I am happy with the MPow Headphones and would buy them again if I needed another pair of headphones.",1
5.0,"Cool headphones, great audio","October 15, 2017",Yes,"Love these headphones. Comfortable to wear, even with glasses, and they do block out noise...The reason I got these is because of my cat's daily sleeping habits. My cat likes to sleep right next to my computer, and would sometimes lay on top of the cable for my wired headphones. So if he fell asleep on my headphone wire, I couldn't wear my headphones. I absolutely need music/video while I work, and these Mpow headphones make it so much easier for me. I can listen with the included aux cable, and if my cat has pinned down the aux cable, I can just unplug the headphones and connect via Bluetooth...Audio quality is great. I sometimes change the equalizer settings on my computer to get even better audio for what I'm watching/listening to at the time. I haven't tried the microphone. 10/10 would buy again, and may get another set for my husband because he was jealous.",1
5.0,"Works great, great customer service.","August 19, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for when I have to fly for work.  When I first got them I tested them and they seemed okay.  They're really comfortable and the sound is decent.  But when I finally took them to the airport to use they were dead.  I though maybe I forgot to shut them off so I plugged them in at the airport.  The charging light came on for a second then shut off.  I left them plugged in for an hour and they were still dead.  I could use the Bluetooth while they were plugged in but that pretty much defeats the purpose of having Bluetooth headphones.  Pretty disappointed...Update: Seller sent me a pair of replacement headphones.  So far they seem to be doing much better.  I'll update again after I have to take them on the next airplane in a week and see if they last the whole time...Update 2:. Just had a 13 hour day of flying and they lasted for the entire duration.  First pair was bad, but great customer service and replacement works great.",1
3.0,Sound/mic interference.,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"The sound and mic start to die after some time. When I first got them, it would take a few hours before, as others told me,""my voice became far away and robotic"". At the same time, I would start hearing static. This is sometimes fixed by turning the headset off an on again. I was hoping this issue would resolve itself, or at least not get any worse. Unfortunately, they are now at the point that this issue happens every few minutes, and it is increasingly unlikely that turning it off and on again fixes the issue...Since both the sound and mic start to die at the same time, it seems like it's either a battery or connectivity issue. Yet I've left it charge for over a day before use and never had an issue with bluetooth devices before. Since I primarily got these for making calls, whatever the cause may be, this has made the headset unusable...Do not waste your money on these. Yes, they are comfortable and they do fold up nicely, but what good is that if they can't do their job as either headphones or a mic?..Edit: About a week or so after posting my original review, I was sent a replacement as their PR sent me an e-mail claiming the previous was ""defective"". I haven't done extensive testing with the replacement, as I had already bought another brand (slightly more expensive). From what I've found, the replacement resolved the issues I listed above, though sound quality is definitely better when plugged in. Thus, I conclude that this headset is alright for the cost, though it was definitely worth it to spend another $5-10 on the headset I got in the meantime, simply for the higher quality sound/mic when wireless.",7
2.0,Mic is pretty bad.,"June 26, 2017",Yes,"The sound is pretty decent, but the mic really sucks. I cannot use them for phone calls, which is a deal breaker. No one can hear me. People say It I sound hallow and that it picks up all background noise. I'm going to have to return these.",5
5.0,I LOVE these headphones,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"I LOVE these headphones, I am still learning how to work them. I had a slight issue after charging &amp; using them down to recharge stage. For some reason I was unable to get the charging light to stay on longer than just a few minutes, even after a few hours it just didn't seem that it was charging by using the USB port on my laptop. I finally just used my USB charger that I use for my phone and charged them for quite a few hours during the night. Next morning I ended up having to remove them completely from my Bluetooth on my laptop &amp; then add again for it to be recognized &amp; work. I'm hoping it was ""user"" error and something I can learn to avoid problems again because when they are working for me I REALLY do LOVE them!!!",0
5.0,Best Bluetooth Headphones I've EVER Owned!,"October 15, 2018",Yes,"The absolute best bluetooth headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is sharp and clear, the battery life is unbelievable (more than 12 hours of listening), and the signal strength is superb! They are also very comfortable.I've had a pair last over two years before my dog chewed them to pieces, after which I gladly bought another pair of the exact same. I love these headphones!",2
5.0,MPOW Headphones Much Better Than the Price Suggests,"November 26, 2017",Yes,"The MPOW 059 Bluetooth Headphones are on of those rare products that just requires a screaming shout out about!  I love them!  I was looking for a cheap pair of headphones to replace some crummy tv headphones and I didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I got a LOT more than I anticipated.  The headphones are comfortable, sound good and are wireless.  The cellphone mic was an added plus.  I was also in the market for a pair of Beats or Bose for traveling, but not now ...  I'll use these MPOW headphones for traveling and TV.  Audiophiles might pooh-pooh the lack of ""rich base"" or whatever, but for the price, these MPOW headphones are groovy!",1
4.0,Maybe not the best for little heads?,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"I have a very small head even for a small adult (I'm 5'2"") and these things just hurt! They don't feel good on the top of my head no matter how much I adjust them, and my ears are just squished and sore after a couple of minutes. I'm going to give them to my ten year old niece. Hopefully they will be comfortable for her...Update: 2 stars to 3 - Gave them to my boyfriend. His head is larger than mine. Worked out alright for him. I do not know why, but they squeezed my little ears and hurt the top of my head...Update: 3 stars to 4 - They sent me a replacement model, the H2. It is actually much more comfortable for my head. Thanks so much! I would recommend the H2s over this one if you have a small head. But I guess everyone is different.",0
4.0,and good enough quality for Bluetooth,"December 4, 2017",Yes,"Incredibly budget friendly, and good enough quality for Bluetooth. Fits VERY snugly to help cancel out noise, but the cushioning is also very comfortable. This is also super durable, and the fact that it is foldable is another plus. I constantly trip over headphone cables, so the fact that this is wireless has been IMMENSELY helpful. It also holds its charge for about a week, and I use these headphones frequently...One drawback would be the fact that you have to play around with your audio settings quite a bit to get both the highest quality sound and microphone capability. Also, turning this on seems to give me super high ping when playing video games, but maybe that's just Bluetooth...All in all a good purchase.",1
4.0,These are very nice headphones. The sound is very good,"December 6, 2017",Yes,"These are very nice headphones. The sound is very good, they feel sturdy, and the padding mutes outside noise very well. I tried using them with my phone, and the mic worked well, but it was odd to speak on the phone with my own voice a bit muffled. For that reason, these seem better for listening to content without noise interference than for extended phone conversations, though I might get used to it over time. Only 2 negatives: (1) I had to hold the on/off/pair button for a while to make anything happen and had to try a few times to get the timing right for turning them on or off - this may just take practice; and (2) though they were generally comfortable, I found they squeezed sensitive spots around the jaw joint or above my ear, and when I adjusted the headpiece, the ears drooped a bit low. The issue may be my particular anatomy or maybe all headphones of this type fit this way.",1
5.0,AWESOME SOUND QUALITY,"June 5, 2017",Yes,just received my MPOW BLUETOOTH STEREO HEADSET RED... great sound quality... fits on my ears comfortably.... nice and snug.... worn for hours and no discomfort... love the folding feature and extra accessories and storage pouch.... don't understand what the fuss was about with earmuffs not fitting ears... the headband is adjustable and is adequate for average size... maybe some were irregular... only one kink my bluetooth feature is showing as paired on my GALAXY TAB E and my SM-T230NU but it doesn't connect to media.... so more investigating.... its not a deal breaker and i won't be sending it back... i love them... very fast shipping and in good condition upon delivery,1
5.0,These things are great. I have used them quite a bit thus ...,"August 28, 2017",Yes,"These things are great.  I have used them quite a bit thus far and they work well.  During travel, they block out airplane engine and cabin sounds well, even when not in use.  My tablet has a weak sound card and produces low volume.  These headphones have sufficient amplification to make my tablet useful in the airport and in flight.  So far (about a month) I have been on 8 flights with these headphones and had no issues.  They are pretty durable.  They get folded up and tossed in my backpack with my PC, tablet, kindle, food, and accessories bags.  I have not been especially careful with them, though I usually fold them up.  So far, they have not shown any signs of wear and continue to look and function the same as the day I got them.  You can't beat this deal.",1
5.0,Excellent quality for the price.,"September 8, 2018",Yes,"Excellent headphones. I purchased them a while ago, use them everyday. I use them for my audible books, iPod, and to watch videos on my laptop. These have great range, I leave what I am listening to in one room and can walk all over my house. I have owned two other types and they bothered my ears after a short time. These cover my entire ear and are very comfortable. Do need to rest my ears every now and again, but that is normal.",1
4.0,"Good build, bad audio quality!","March 26, 2018",Yes,Well built but the sound quality issssssss not good at all. My 8 year old turtle beach headphones sound better. Going to order something else and see if it sounds any better 90% sure I will return...Update: Ordered a different set of bluetooth headphones from another company and they sounded 10x better...Update2: The company contacted me and offered to send me a new set of headphones. The headphones they sent were the H5 model (https://www.amazon.com/Mpow-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones-Memory-Protein/dp/B0798G3248). This headphone sounds great but fits a little tight on my head. Okay to wear for an hr or so but after that my head started to hurt. I am attempting to stretch them out see if it helps over time. Increasing my review from 2 starts to 4 stars since the new headphones sound great and they have great customer service.,0
3.0,"Lights flashing when in use, bothersome to me when watching movies","January 4, 2018",Yes,"They are just ok. I was super excited for these to arrive because I received Beats for Christmas and they sat on top of the ear vs over so my ears hurt and I returned them. I immediately opened my new headphones and put them on. They seemed really comfortable. I charged them and then decided to watch a movie later that night and that’s when I encountered my first issue and ultimately the dealbreaker. A light flashes on the right headphone making it quite distracting when watching in the dark, which I do every night. Due to this reason I will be returning them...Overall I’d say that if flashing lights don’t bother you, then get them. They are comfy for less that $50 and sound quality isn’t bad... The pairing process was pretty simple with my 7plus.",1
5.0,Bluetooth connect stopped working,"December 22, 2017",Yes,"I had originally left one star and a bad review because the Bluetooth on the headphones stopped working after a couple months, but the company reached out and contacted me and replaced the headphones for free, so that's really awesome. Amazing customer service and the new headphones work great. Will update again in a couple months. Thanks Mpow for replacing the headphones!",2
4.0,Expected quality for the price,"September 26, 2018",Yes,"Got these for my SO because the cats liked to destroy the cables on her previous headphones. Material seems cheap, but for once I think that has turned out to be a plus. The earpiece is soft, and the product overall is fairly light. I could wear these for hours before feeling uncomfortable. Even still, it doesn't feel like the plastic is going to snap any time soon, so hopefully it will withstand the cats..The sound quality is, quite frankly, mediocre. Nothing stands out about how these sound, good or bad. Because of the material, they do not isolate noise well. I could hear cats meowing in the next room while playing music. I have not had the chance to hear how the microphone sounds myself, but I made a call and the person on other end said they couldn't hear anything I was playing through the headset..As for battery life, I used the headphones for about 5 hours on medium volume starting from 100% charge. My phone says the battery is at 80%, which is a little better than the listed product specs. I expect the battery life to decrease with use as with any wireless device, so I'm glad it's starting off strong...Nothing too special overall aside from the price tag. If you're having difficulty picking a color, this particular shade and texture of red is very toy-like. If that sort of look bugs you, I recommend picking a color option with a black or gray inner lining.",0
4.0,centrally located and easy to quickly hit when I need to pay attention ...,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"Pros:.Connects to two devices. Handy, since that means I can connect it to my phone and my tablet when I'm at the office..""Good enough for work"" sound quality..Play/Pause button is large, centrally located and easy to quickly hit when I need to pay attention to something else..Not noise cancelling, but the sound isolation is pretty good. Sometimes I leave these on at the office, even when nothing is playing... just for the added quiet..Quick to charge, but I love that I can attach a cable and run them corded if I need to..Cons:.Started to get an odd buzz/hum in the left earpiece intermittently. A minor annoyance, but stands out when listening to speech (i.e. podcasts). Honestly, that's about the only thing negative I have to say about them.",0
5.0,Fantastic Headphones,"October 19, 2018",Yes,"I've only had these headphones for a while, but they are great for the price. The sound quality is excellent. They have plenty of bass for the genres of music I listen to. Battery life is great. They connected with Windows 10 without a problem. You can control the track, volume, and pause the songs with the buttons on the headphones. I use Windows Groove, and they interface with that music player seamlessly. iTunes is a little different story as you have to change a setting in iTunes before you can play through bluetooth...I would recommend these headphones to anyone. They are not Bose or Beats, but they also don't cost $300+.",0
5.0,"Good sound and feel, everything else is terrible!","April 27, 2018",Yes,"THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW (was previously 2 stars).I was excited upon opening the box to find that these headphones felt heavy and of good quality. When I put them on while laying down the weight causes them to fall off, okay, somewhat annoying. When I put them on to watch a movie on my iPad because my husband is asleep (why I got the headphones in the first place), there is the brightest flashing coming from the side of one of the headphones. So then I am searching for electrical tapes to cover it up so I don’t wake him up. Okay, now I’m more annoyed. The next time I go to use them, the buttons that you press down to turn on/off and connect the headphone wirelessly are almost impossible to engage! I lost it at this point. The point of a pair of wireless headphones is to make your life easier, not an epic frustration. The only reason there are any stars is because they feel good and the sound is good, not that I can get them to work now...Update:.The company reached out and replaced my headphones with a new model (the MPOW H2) which work much better for my purposes. The light on that one is very dim and small and is no trouble in the dark if that is a concern to you. Also, the buttons on that model are all separate and easier to press. I am very happy with the exchange, and think that the previous set of headphones was just a defective pair given the majority of positive reviews. A good company!",0
5.0,Almost a year of crazy durability and great sound quality,"October 22, 2018",Yes,"If I could give it ten starts I would.I bought them for $30 and I have tortured these headphones for almost a year now. I’ve worked out in them every day, done long runs in the rain and wind, dropped them countless times, and by some miracle they keep going. Eventually the material that holds the foam on the headband started to come apart. I think the adhesive started to give out during long runs in blazing heat. I just duct taped it in place and never stopped using them..Beyond durability they have amazing sound quality, and just as important they have incredible timing. Most Bluetooth headphones in this price range aren’t worth using for watching videos because people’s mouths and the words never line up. This is NEVER and issue with these headphones. I’ve Loved these things almost to their death and when they finally go I’ll be buying again!",0
2.0,"Comfortable, stylish and loved the controls, but defective out-of-the-box. Returned.","March 19, 2018",Yes,"Loved the frosty pink color and controls on the ear pieces, but unfortunately the pair I received was defective. I was recommended this pair by a co-worker who has the black/red color scheme - he never had any issues, and raved about the comfort of all-day wear as well as the great battery life. Out-of-the-box, these came with a horrid static sound in both ears. I was able to successfully pair with my work computer and had no other issues playing music and YouTube videos, but the awful static was constant and relentless no matter what settings I applied. To better test, I put on another song and went back to my old wired over-the-ear headphones - the sound was fine as it always had been. Sadly, I had to return these :( Maybe I'll try again one day.",0
5.0,Comfortable and easy to use.,"February 2, 2018",Yes,I bought these for a very long airplane ride and I love them! They have great sound quality and their noise cancelling is comparable to the more expensive headphones. I love that they have the option to be Bluetooth or plug in because sometimes it’s nice to not use so much battery by having the Bluetooth on on my cell phone all the time. The battery lasted a long time and they are very quick to charge. They are easy to set up to use with both an iPhone and an iPod. They are very comfortable and even after a few hours of wearing them they didn’t hurt or become irritating like some other brands I’ve tried. I also like that they fold up and come with a carrying case for easy storage,1
4.0,Solid headphones at this price point.,"July 29, 2017",Yes,"I got these because I evidently have oddly-shaped ear canals and ear buds are always uncomfortable for me. I enjoy them a lot so far. The sound is clear (though could use a touch more lows/mids) both from the headphones and from the built-in microphone. The controls on the side that allow you to adjust volume/skip to the next track are nice, but not entirely practical as you can't see them when they're on your head. I've only tested the range as far as about 15 feet, but they worked great with the exception of a small hiccup or two. They're also super simple and quick to pair with your device (mine being a Samsung Galaxy S8). Only reason I hesitate to give five stars is because the top of the headphones, even with the padding, is just a tiny bit uncomfortable. Otherwise, great buy, especially for the price.",1
4.0,Obnoxious flashing blue light!,"November 27, 2017",Yes,I received these yesterday and used them last night. I have a hard time sleeping because of my anxiety so I listen to light hearted shows to shut my mind off so I can fall asleep. To my dismay after I shut the lights off and closed my eyes to try and fall aleep there was an obnoxious flashing blue light. I quickly realized it was coming from the headphones. I got out the booklet to see if it could be turned off but no it can’t. It flashes every six seconds when they are on. WHY??? It is obnoxious. The flashing even woke my husband up. Whoever thought that a constant flashing blue light was a cool feature to have must not have thought about how annoying that was going to be in the dark. Other than that they have good sound and are fairly comfortable to wear.,2
2.0,Poor sound quality while using Bluetooth/does not come with appropriate hardware.,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"Be aware that hi-fi is no supported over Bluetooth. The sound quality drop is very noticeable while using Bluetooth and only becomes high quality when using the TRS cable to connect to your phone/controller/stereo/etc...Also, speaking of TRS cables (Tip, Ring, Sleeve), it does not come with the proper 3.5mm cable. It should come with a 3.5mm TRRS cable (Tip, Ring, Ring, Sleeve). A TRS or TRRS is simply the connector at the end of a pair of earbuds. Some of these have two rings, which is a TRS (confusing, I know), while a TRRS has three rings on the connector. TRRS supports a microphone, whilst a TRS does not. The cable that comes with these headphones is a TRS, which means WHILE PLUGGED IN these headphones do not allow use of the microphone...Do not buy these for a gaming system as the Bluetooth is not supported (looking at you, PS4 players). Also, you can not plug it into your controller as the microphone is not supported while it is plugged in using the TRS cable it comes with. I have not yet tried buying a TRRS cable yet to see if it will support the microphone, but I will soon.",1
5.0,Warm sound with plenty of bass,"September 3, 2017",Yes,"A very warm sound with plenty of bass but nowhere near as boomy as Beats.  Controls are fine and easy to access.  I have mainly listened to classical music and for that, it is fine.  Timpani sound really good.  It is typical of bluetooth phones.  That is, it no way has a 30 feet range.  It is more like 12 feet before you get dropouts when you turn around.  Maybe you can get 30 feet if you have a direct line of sight with no obstructions of any kind and without reflections.  However, it is as good as any of my bluetooth phones.  I never have a problem when I have my iPhone in a pocket with me.",1
5.0,They have been great. Had for about 6 months now,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"Bought a set for each member of our family to get away from corded headphones with their iphones for Netlfix, Youtube, audiobook, etc.  They have been great.  Had for about 6 months now. Still hold a charge, chargers work well.  Did have one charger cable fail (we had bought 4 sets of these headphones).  So the cable didn't last as long as the headphones. Have 3 other cables, but also have some other cables that fit as that end is somewhat common (e.g., my portable battery for recharging, an Anchor product, has a compatible cord, so I can use that).  On the whole, very happy with this.  Sounds nice, dampens outside noise when wearing. wifi range is good. connects and disconnects easily with one button push (or hold).  Worth the price in my opinion",0
4.0,Three Week Review,"November 15, 2017",Yes,"I have used the headphones for several weeks now.  The good is I have had no problems connecting Bluetooth.  So far I have connected to iPhone 6 plus, Samsung notebook, and iPod touch.  The sound adjusts well but I am still becoming accustomed to setting the volume on the ear piece.  The sound quality is acceptable for me.  I have listened to audio books, music, you tube with no sound issues.  I have listened to a seminar online and skype on my notebook where the sound was muffled and low quality.  I assume the problem is with the Notebook.  The headphones work great with Skype on my iPhone.  Overall the headphones should meet my expectations.  Hopefully the quality is such that they will last for a several years.",1
4.0,Really good for the price,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"If you have a big head, these can run a little tight if worn for extended periods of time...Sound is good and connects easily to your devices. They are a little bulky, so I took off a star for that. They hold a charge for quite a long time and use a micro USB cord. They get good range in my apartment, but not sure max distance. I like that you can skip and change volume/pause/play from the headphones instead of having to do it on your phone. They are some of the cheapest Bluetooth earphones and are surprisingly good for that price.",1
4.0,I would buy this product many times over (have not used long term untested),"April 11, 2018",Yes,I would give this a full 6 star review is i could but . It does not fit will with glasses unlike some others can and that is not a large problem just a small one due to the way the design is I don't have any marks or warping of the glasses so that is why i have given 4 stars ...However the sound Quality  is worth 10 stars . The fit of the headphones even with glasses is breathtaking i truly enjoy wearing this product.The easy of connecting it to the laptop was fast and took no time . How ever the power button being 5 seconds to push is slightly annoying.But I have other products that are like that and you get used to it . truly a great design with a MOST AMAZING PRICE THANK YOU...Thank you,0
5.0,Great price on a very good product,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"Great price, you cannot get anything cheaper and these work fine! NOTE: It took me a day to figure out, I had seen many, many reviews claiming after pairing with iphone when you are done you cannot turn off the headset! SOLVED- Turn off the headphones from your setting, tap bluetooth, find the headset, then tap on it and it asked if you want to disconnect, check yes and the headphones turn off!",1
2.0,Volume Does Not Work in Wired Mode,"October 17, 2018",Yes,"The volume control does not work when the headphones are connected to a device via cable.  Volume only works when the headphones' battery is charged and the product is operating in Bluetooth mode...Nowhere is this shortcoming mentioned in the product description on this website or even in the user manual that came with the product...I have an old ratty pair of wired headphones that I wanted to replace which I plug into my TV that does not support Bluetooth.  Then I thought I would use the Bluetooth mode with other devices, like my laptop and iPod.  But having a volume control that does not work all the time is a deal breaker...I am returning the item.",0
5.0,Great headsets for a reasonable price,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"Recieve 2 sets quickly. Have used only for a little over a week now but extremely happy so far. Am impressed with the apparent strong structure of headset, ease of following directions and the sound quality. Also the included cords for charging and wired direct are made with heavier wire than I have used in past, giving a more stable connection....Second headset was used after my first review. It was defective and returned. Received a replacement within 2-3 days, headset has been working perfectly for about a month. Completely satisfied with operation, looks ,durability .and reasonable price for these sets.",1
5.0,"Great sound, comfortable, long battery life","February 14, 2018",Yes,"Amazing sound, comfortable to wear and they have a long battery life.  I bought these to drown out the noise in my office.  These work almost too good as I have had people walk into my space and stand directly behind me, talking to me, and didn't know they were there.The sound quality is much better than I expected from a headphone at this price.  The only negative, they aren't all that comfortable to wear with glasses, but that's a hard thing to obtain with over the ear headphones (not to mention glasses break the seal so they aren't all that noise-cancelling). Best yet - if you use the 3.5mm cable you don't even need to have them charged for them to work. I can almost make it 10 full hours on a single charge.  Very well worth the money.",0
5.0,"Better than the Cowin E7s, better deal than the Bose","September 10, 2017",Yes,"I have the Bose QuietComfort 35s, the Cowin E7 Active Noise Cancelling headphones, and these. These are definitely the best bargain. The sound quality isn't as good on these as on the Bose, and neither is the noise cancelling (which these don't do actively, just by sealing out sound). But the difference honestly isn't that big. And these are as good as the Cowins on both fronts, in my opinion. Like the Bose, but unlike the Cowins, these Mpows are super easy to pair and use. I wear them at home and in the gym and even when I do sit ups these stay on pretty well. Highly recommended.",1
5.0,Bluetooth Headphones,"July 3, 2018",Yes,"I've had these for about a week now. For the price, I think these are fantastic. They're comfortable, easy to use, work well as a microphone, and overall do just what I want them to do. I listen to mostly podcasts and audiobooks, so I can't really speak to how music sounds on them, but I would recommend these to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative to Beats or Bose. They're big, and they're bulky, but it doesn't bother me. I do wish they came with an actual case, and not just a clothe bag, though, because there's no way they'll be kept safe in that. I did order a case, but it hasn't been delivered yet. Overall, I'm very happy with them.",0
2.0,"NOT for gaming - Mono sound quality, and a crappy Mic.","October 31, 2018",Yes,"The headphones don't support AptX, and therefore if you want to use the mic, then you MUST have them in Mono sound, not stereo.  So either you have good audio and no mic, or you have crappy audio with a poor mic...The mic is a shotgun-mic, so it picks up noise in the background and causes a feedback loop that makes a constant hum.  There's also static in the headphones, even when you aren't listening to music.  And the optional audio cord is only 3ft long, so you're screwed if the PC is under your desk...OH, and if you accidentally use a different charging cord, like one for your cell phone, then the headphones might catch fire!!  It's a big warning when you open the packaging.",1
5.0,Perfect headphones,"January 21, 2018",Yes,"I don't think I've ever written a review on Amazon before (Maybe a 1-star review somewhere for a product that pissed me off)..But I couldn't resist writing something quick for these headphones. They are absolutely amazing. For a $36.00 pair of headphones -- WOW...The comfort is unreal. I wear glasses, so I've always struggled with over-the-ear headphones; they typically drive the frames of my glasses into my temple, and end up giving me a headache within 30 minutes. These were delivered to my door this morning at 11:00 AM; it's now 6:00 PM, and I haven't taken them off once. The padding is amazingly soft...The sound is fantastic as well, for $36, it's unbeatable in my opinion...The tech is what amazes me as well. I'm able to pair both my laptop and my phone, and switch between them with ease. I'm able to answer the phone &amp; talk on the phone with the headphones (it has a built-in mic). I'm able to tap the button on the headphones and yell at Siri as well, which is awesome...These are great, I'm about to buy another pair for my girlfriend as well.",1
5.0,Husband loves them!,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"I was very very excited to get these based off the reviews I read here, and though the sound quality is great, it hurts my head when I have them on even for 15 minutes, it feels like it's clamping on the sides of my head, OUCH! 😣 Other than that, I think they sound great...[UPDATE] (1-11-18)..Patazon contacted me after I complained about the MPOW 059's hurting my jaw/head, and they were amazing! They apologized and offered me the newer version of these headphones (MPOW H1 - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HPB1HQ) which are supposed to provide more comfort for longer use. I just received those today, and have been using them on and off for hours. No complaints whatsoever!!! I LOVE them! They sound just as great as the 059's and I feel zero discomfort! They're very soft against the ears and sound amazing. The song I like to use to test out headphone quality is Believer by Imagine Dragons :D  I didn't want the other pair to go to waste so my husband decided to use them, and he says he feels zero pain with them, so perhaps my head is too small??? We are both very please with our new headphones, and I am even more impressed with the customer service from Patozon!",7
4.0,Seller is willing to make things right. I respect that.,"June 27, 2018",Yes,"Update: I was contacted by the seller and they offered to send a different model as a replacement. Because this model that I originally bought was not in the best working order, I can't give 5 stars, but I'll give 4 because the company was willingly to work with me. Even if the product isn't perfect, I can respect a company that wants to make their customer's experiences a positive one. Thank you for that..If you do buy this product, just know that I had pairing problems with Apple products, never tested with windows. Upon watching a video, the voice would be out of sync at times and on higher volumes there is annoying static. Maybe my headphones were just defective, so knowing all of that, buy at your own risk. Even if you get a bad one, the company will work to make it right.",0
5.0,Great Sound and Very Durable!,"October 14, 2018",Yes,"Fantastic battery life - I've taken these on 9+ hour flights no problem. They sound great and block just enough sound to stand long flights, but not too much that I can't hear cars while on my skateboard. Which brings me to the thing I like most about these headphones. They are SUPER durable. I've had these headphones for just under a year and a half, and in that time, I've taken enough falls off my skateboard to really determine their strength. They don't usually go flying when I stumble, but I took a few really bad falls without doing any damage to the casing. They finally did crack after the 1 year mark when I fell and broke my hand, but they still work perfectly. So well in fact, that I put off getting a new pair until just over a week ago. I thought it was time to give them a rest. The new pair work just as well, so far. Will purchase again!",2
3.0,Just Meh,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"I was looking for cans that were comfortable affordable and sound good.  I took a chance on these based on reviews and have to say I am disappointed..  And it’s past the window to return them (sigh).  In all fairness, these are well made and certainly seem sturdy enough however....Comfort: Epic fail here.  After about 20 to 30 minutes of use they hurt!  Adjusting the head band doesn’t help..Cost:  Only reason I even gave these 3 stars.  The price is right AND if you aren’t expecting much AND if you have a smallish head these might suffice....that being said.....Sound:  While the sound of these is decent,  they are bass heavy and seem unable to handle some musical styles.  The treble is almost too crisp and  midrange gets lost.  Just as 20 to 30 minutes was enough for these to be uncomfortable, so did the sound hurt my ears.  I am not an audiophile but do recognize good sounding headphones. These are ok but not great.  Perhaps I was expecting too much at this price range...I really wanted to like this product but ultimately I will be looking for something better...*****Update 3/23/18****** -  I updated  this to a 5  for the following reason  - First and foremost - excellent customer service.  Shortly after I posted this review, the seller (Patazon) contacted me to ask if i would be willing to try a different set  and i agreed.

5.0,Best Bluetooth headphones I’ve ever had,"August 31, 2018",Yes,"I’ve had beats and skull candy headphones before, but they don’t compare to the mpow ones. I’ve owned my pair for about a year now and they work wonderfully. The battery lasts me most of the week, and I use them for about 5 hours a day. I’d say you can easily get around 20 hours of battery life for only about an hour or two of charging. I also love that they can be wired or Bluetooth, because even if I run out of battery I can still use the headphones corded. They’re pretty comfortable now, although they take a little bit of time to get used to, about a week of regular use. Lord knows I’ve dropped mine several times (I’m a bit of a klutz), but there isn’t even a scratch on them. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants quality headphones without paying over $100 for them.",0
5.0,Worth the money,"June 2, 2017",Yes,"They say you get what you pay for and in this case you get a wee bit more. Superior sound quality for the price, comfortable to wear for extended period of time. What I like the best are the control buttons, I have big ole fingers and the buttons are just as big and my finger is not pushing two buttons at the same time like many other head pones I have had in the past. Great base and not over powering in Db's. For $36 they are well worth it and I would recommend these to anyone one a budget, not all of us can afford the $300.00 head phone.",2
5.0,Buy these.,"August 22, 2017",Yes,"I was hesitant to buy these based on the price. I figured that since they were $37, they would be terrible. I was wrong. The. Artery life exceeded my expectations. The fit is great. The fact that they fold up and fit in my backpack is awesome...The only thing that I find wrong with them as far as I can tell is that they sound a little muffled and bass heavy. This is just my opinion since I listen to more rock-type music...Great buy, would recommend. They also work great at the gym. Another plus is that if you lose, or break them, they were not expensive.",1
3.0,"Excellent for awhile, Right speaker now broken","March 17, 2018",Yes,"First review:I love these headphones, have been in almost constant use for three months after purchase for my christmas present to myself. I love the sound quality and I am satisfied with the range. I often use the headphones for several hours at a time, and they are great to drag around my college campus. There is, as I found out in the instruction manual, a 1 in every 6s blue flash to show that the bluetooth is connected which does not bother be but is not information I was able to find before purchase and might change some people's minds (one of my friends was considering them before seeing this)..Update: Now it is about 4.5 months later, and I am disappointed to say that the right speaker is at about 1/4 the volume of the left speaker. I do not know how it happened but it is very annoying and I love them so much that it makes me sad that they are mostly broken now after less than half a year. I guess I might get another pair eventually but that is alot for things that break so fast.",0
4.0,Great headphones but treble is dull,"December 14, 2017",Yes,"These are great BT headphones for the price, I just didn't like that they sound a bit flat to me. I read many reviews before choosing these but honestly, my cheap BT earbuds have better sound quality. I wanted an over-ear set to drown out background noise in my workshop, and they do a good job of that and are very comfortable but the highs aren't very bright. The bass is fine but I enjoy crisp cymbals and other treble-y sounds in the music I listen to and these just don't deliver that. I'm giving them to my grandson for Xmas now and looking for a better set lol.",1
5.0,Best Bluetooth headphones at this price point,"December 30, 2017",Yes,I use these at the gym so when I'm busting out 9000lb squats and grunting like a hyena the complaints I hear from fellow fitness doers falls on my deaf ears. Bluetooth works at a good distance. Battery lasts for I think is almost forever. Buttons are responsive. I initially had Bluetooth difficulties where it would not play music for like a 1/4 a second but that problem has disappeared. I run with them and they stay put very well and not gosh darn heckin cord to worry about which is a plus. The head size adjustment is solid and doesn't shift unless you want them to,1
4.0,"Comfy, high quality for price, good battery, long-lasting battery, but large and clunky","November 9, 2017",Yes,"Decent sound quality, especially considering the price. The headphones are fit nicely on my enormous head, and are very comfortable around the ear; they don't squish your ear against your skull like some headphones do, limiting you to only being able to wear them comfortably for a couple hours. I have had these headphones on for as long as 8 or 9 hours (speaks to how great the battery is, too), without feeling discomfort around my ears. Additionally, the Bluetooth connectivity with my iPhone 6s and 2012 MacBook Pro works without error every time...My only complaint with these headphones is that they are not the most stylish, though they seem to be the most functional for the price. I would prefer to wear more low-profile headphones, but these are on the larger side, which makes me feel like they stick out a little been when wearing them in public. Regardless, I would still recommend these headphones if you're on a budget.",1
5.0,"Extra great for my rough 11yo son! Good sound, good looking and durable!","September 23, 2017",Yes,"I bough these for my 11yo son who goes through a pair of headphones every 2 weeks. He destroys every single pair he has had. So far, these are holding up very well. He loves them. He keeps them charged and will plug them in sometimes, just because...He loves the look of them and how durable they are. He ends up shoving them in his backpack, which is a war zone. They are very durable and are taking the hurting he puts on them...The sound is clear and muffles the sound enough for those sitting next to him to only hear a little bit of the sound when he has the volume jacked up.",1
5.0,These headphones are great they have a soft protein memory that is super ...,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"The Mpow Wireless Headphones and are bluetooth compatible, but also include a 3.5mm detachable cord for people you prefer wired headphones. These headphones are great they have a soft protein memory that is super gentle around the ears and on top of the head. These headphones have an amazing range of 33 feet and have an excellent driver of 40mm on each earmuff. The bass on these headphones is amazing it is like you have a subwoofer on your ears, when I was listening to a bass test I could feel it on the back of my neck. The only thing that I dislike of this headset is that the headband starts to slightly hurt after about two hours on your head. On Amazon these headphones are $34.99 and at Walmart they are $37.99. These headphones have amazing quality and are great for traveling, if you need to save space in your small bag these are great. Also if you like to use your headphones or earbuds for calls these are fully compatible for bluetooth calling and also if you prefer wired headphones these have a detachable cord. When you receive the package you will find the Mpow bluetooth headset, a 3.5mm detachable cord, travel bag, and a charging cable. Also these headphones have a battery life of 13 hours when fully charged and a 15 hour battery life when you use these headphones for calls, and have infinity hours when you use the wire. The headphones feel amazing they are super comfortable and plus I have a big head and these are a great fit without being uncomfortable on my head. I have dropped these headphones a few times and they are super durable I mean I obviously have not dropped them off a building and they are perfectly fine but just a few feet off of the ground without any damage. These headphones are probably directed more towards young adults like teens and adults that like to take calls with your headphones or just chilling and listens to your jams. These headphones I would definitely buy them again because they are super comfortable and are suitable to me style of living and listening to music.Also this product is worth the buy because they are amazing, they work perfectly the fit amazingly and they are fully compatible with any device that is able to connect with bluetooth items.",1
5.0,The best headphones I've ever owned,"May 13, 2018",Yes,"These are easily the best headphones I've ever owned. Now, I'm no audiophile, so I've never spend over a hundred bucks on a pair. But I appreciate good quality, high-bass, deep audio for my music, especially while programming...Beautiful sound.  Very comfortable and fully adjustable, great quality and excellent, modern but not d**chey look. Great, clean and strong bluetooth connection, pretty quick to charge back up. They frickin plug in too and do not require power when plugged in, as they come with a male-male aux sound cord! I use them plugged in on planes, when the battery is dying, etcetera...Anyone who buys the hyped up Beats when this is on the market is a sucker.",0
5.0,Most bang for your buck; no problems worth writing home about,"August 31, 2017",Yes,"These headphones fit well (I don't have big ears, but I can never find hats, etc for a head as big as mine). If your ears aren't too big, you can wear it for hours and hours with no discomfort...Good sound quality. Blocks enough sound, too, that I'm not distracted in a room full of people, but, with the volume at around 40%, I can still hear someone calling my name (perfect!)...Battery life is ridiculously long. Bought mine more than a month ago, been watching a TV show or two with it every day, and it's still at 45% power! (Truth is, it's been so long, I forgot where I put the charger! I hear an Android phone charger works just fine.)..No connectivity issues. I use it with my phone (Android) and laptop. Decent range. Unobstructed, you can get signal across a room from your device, but I do get the occasional tiny pause in my music when my phone is in my pocket and I bend or turn, obstructing the signal...The pause/play button doesn't work as you'd expect for all applications (works perfect for my music app, but only works as a pause for my video apps--Hulu, Prime)...Overall, an excellent pair of headphones, especially for their price range.",1
3.0,Don't buy these!,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"Update:  May 29. 2018- After the company sent me back the headphones, they still didn't function properly after first charging them.  HOWEVER, when instructed to try them on different devices a couple of weeks later, the headphones worked just fine.  I haven't had a problem with them sense then.  The company was very helpful and bent over backwards to make sure I was satisfied...April 2018-Received the headphones earlier today.  Charged them as instructed and was excited to try them out.  Plugged them into my laptop and started playing youtube music videos.  Volume was low on the headphones and I couldn't hear the voices in the song, only the music.  There was also a distorted sound in the background.  Very disappointed!",0
5.0,Great headphones for casual listening,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"These headphones work for my purposes. I like to listen to audiobooks while I do household chores and these work great for that. They're comfortable for over an hour, and if they get uncomfortable after a longer time I can just adjust where they are sitting a little bit and it's comfortable again. I like the over-ear design...I'm not a sound connoisseur, so they sound just fine to me. They do block some amount of noise, and in fact I would not want headphones that block it completely because I need to still be aware of what's going on around me...The Bluetooth functions were easy to set up. Just had to read and follow the instructions step by step.",1
4.0,"Good value, but some issues","January 14, 2018",Yes,"You get what you pay for with these headphones. They're not an amazing deal for the price, but the build quality is solid and they're comfortable and durable. The sound quality is the biggest issue, and is simply not very good. There is a lot of reverb and the bass is *extremely* overbearing. The sound quality is a bit tinny as well. However, for the price you can't expect much better. The only other issue i've had with the headphones is that the cord they come with is very short. If you plan to use the bluetooth functionality, this isn't an issue, but if you prefer wired like me you'll need to replace the cord with your own. Luckily, I have a few male-to-male audio cables lying around. Unfortunately, the port on the headphones themselves is encased in plastic and is very small, so neither of my standard audio cables could fit - I had to take a knife to one to whittle down the protective rubber around it in order to get it to fit fully inside the jack. If you plan to use the headphone wire and want more than a foot or two of cable length, you'll probably need to invest in a male-to-female audio cable to extend the length, or a male-to-male cable with a low diameter audio jack. Just something to keep in mind.",1
4.0,"A Good Pair of Headphones, Very Light","July 19, 2017",Yes,"They are much lighter than I thought they would be. That's a plus, as I was looking for a pair that wouldn't fall off my face every time I looked down...After wearing for a couple hours, I did feel a bit of discomfort on the top of my head, but it's nothing I couldn't put up with. About the not being over-ear part, they are over-ear; However, I have small ears, and the cups are a bit small for anyone with larger ears. I let my brother try them on, he has large ears, and he did say they didn't feel like over-ear headphones. So, keep that in mind...The cups themselves are on a free moving pivot and allow for more conformity, something I found helpful...The battery lasts as long as I need it to. Haven't had them die on me yet. I don't listen to music for extensive periods of time. They come in the box half charged as far as I could tell. You will need to charge them fully for first time use...The only thing that makes me worry is the micro-USB charge port in the right headphone. It seems precarious. It is tight on most cables I have and it might get pushed inside the plastic if you're not careful. There isn't much glue holding it there. If it becomes a problem later, I will update this review. I will most likely take the plastic off and superglue it if and when this happens...The manual is quite small, in order to fit in the box, but I could read it just fine. The text is small, but not unreadable to the naked eye. Maybe it is harder for older people to read. It has everything you could ask in it and I saw no typos or weird wording...As these are folding headphones, I was initially worried that the movement would chafe the cables inside the headband. I immediately checked this first. This does not seem to be a problem. The cables are held in place and hardly move when folding. There is no visible slack either. The hinges are made of metal, so I doubt they will easily break...The button ring on the side is not raised, so there is no tactile feedback, but the configuration is easy to remember. Top-volume up, Right-forward, Bottom-volume down, Left-back, Center-on, pair, off, accept calls, pause/play...I'm not a sound aficionado by any means, but I think they sound great. Not very intense bass if that's what you're looking for. Good for everyday casual use, but not for specialists...I hope this was helpful and I'll answer any questions you might have.",1
5.0,Look elsewhere and spend a bit more.,"January 18, 2018",Yes,"EDIT 3/14/2018: I was contacted by Bella in the customer service department regarding my original purchase of the MPOW headphones. After talking with her, she sent me a new pair of the MPOWs that work fine. No static/chopping, battery life is great, and they're COMFORTABLE. I updated this review because of both the product, and the customer service...You get what you pay for. Sound quality isn't great. They're pretty comfortable. My biggest problem is that I always get static/chops when walking with my phone in my pocket, so I'm guessing the bluetooth receiver used is pretty low-end. This is my first pair of bluetooth over-ear headphones, so I didn't want to go too high end incase. That being said, I wish I would've found something a step above these mpow's.",0
2.0,Do not remove from computer!!!,"September 30, 2018",Yes,"The head set is very comfortable, the sound is really great. But..... do not ever ever ever remove it form your computer to another one and expect it to work in the first computer again. I'm looking for some sort of de-install method to remove every vestage of the drivers and maybe try and re-intall...I cannot find a method of installing a working driver. The cd does not install a functioning system the second time and a driver downloaded from the site tells me my bluetooth device is not authorized. I'm not going to reformat my hard drive over this...They do still work with the wire attached. Which is not the reason I bought them...Update: MPOW sent me a replacement set as response to this review. They are the fold-up model. Very nice. And very nice of them. They read these reviews and and good customer service. After uninstalling the driver and rooting out the registry I re-installed and all is working well.",0
5.0,Very happy!!! Very comfortable and sound is good. Great Value,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"While some people may receive a defect product and give it a bad review, mine was fine. The real purpose I bought these was for work. I work in an open environment and my number 1 reason was something that was comfortable and reduced noise. I thought if I could find a cheap pair that could play ambient music I would be very happy. They aren't BOSE, but for the price I don't think there is anything better, I really don't. They are very comfortable, the ear cup fits all the way over my ear for noise reduction. Sound is great with a cord! Of course any music/sound quality is going to be reduced by the bandwidth of bluetooth, but these really sound very good. Very happy!! I've only had these 2 months now and I leave them on my desk at work so I expect them to last, but we will see. If they go bad I'll update the review. See ya!!",0
4.0,I love this Bluetooth headset,"July 20, 2017",Yes,"I love this Bluetooth headset. Powers up and connects quickly to my cell phone. The adjustable headset fits comfortably and just about blocks out all ambient sound. If someone wants your attention, they either have to shout or throw something at you! The only downside for me is the bass. I wish there was some sort of tone control to bring up the treble. All in all, a good buy..10/10/17: Had a slight hearing problem in my left ear that cut down on higher frequencies. Problem fixed and I can appreciate the sound from this headset. It is beautiful! I'm a Liquid Mind listener and the sound is awesome!",1
5.0,Great Bluetooth Headphones for the Price,"January 16, 2018",Yes,"I have been using these headphones for the past few days and I don't have many complaints about them. I love the design, I love the premium feel they have, the black finish is fantastic. The build of these headphones is great, they feel very sturdy in the hand, and they don’t feel cheap. I like the ear cushions they fit over the ear nicely, and they are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time...The audio quality is good, bass response is enough to where it doesn’t take away from the audio experience, but I do think that the audio could be improved, highs are great, mids are ok, and bass is good. I would have liked it better if they were more noise canceling, they muffled outside noise more than cancelled it, but once you start playing music loud enough, you won’t be able to hear anything going on around you. For the price of $39 I definitely would recommend these headphones to a friend or family member who is looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.",0
3.0,"Great sound, brittle headband.","November 17, 2017",Yes,"Excellent sound quality, though a younger person may quibble on that. Nice over ear fit, and somewhat adjustable. Multiple pairing is a good feature, but the headset beeps when one of the paired devices is out of range. Pairing is pain free...Con: the headband is sturdy side to side, but not “twistable. Mine showed stress cracks on both sides and gave way after five months. I often move one cup behind an ear to be able to hear when others try to get my attention. This set clearly was not designed to give a user that option...I’d highly recommend it for general use but not in situations where you need to free one ear.",1
5.0,Great Headphones for the Gym or PC,"October 10, 2018",Yes,"The sound quality isn’t the best, it’s actually much less than a pair of Sennheiser‘s or Dre beats. However this is a very comfortable set of headphones, and I was very skeptical before I purchased it. If you’re looking for a cheap pair of headphones that you can use it to gym,  and something that won’t fall apart so quickly, but these.  They are just like the draperies, except the sound quality is it and center.  They are just like if I dre beats  except their sound quality is it 100% I would give it about 75%. The volume isn’t really high, but that doesn’t bother me, because it’s still a high end quality item. Purchase these if you want to use them to listen to music on the pc or at the gym.",0
4.0,"Great headphones, but flawed","September 5, 2017",Yes,"I have had these headphones for a few days now and I will say that I am quite impressed with them for the price. However, there are some flaws. The battery charges super fast and seems to last for a very long time. I charged them for an hour when I got them(went to 100%) and it is now 5 days later and they are at about half. I have used them everyday, so I am happy with the battery life. Another pro is how comfortable they are. I have worn them for about 2 hours at a time and they never hurt my head.They are very nicely cushioned. My final pro is the sound. Honestly, they sound great. Very comparable to Beats Solo's. I use them for listening to music and videos, and the sound is perfect...Now on to some issues with them. First is more of a personal preference, and it may not bother some people.There is a flashing light on the power button that consistently flashes when the headphones are on. It's fine during the day, but if you use them at night it gets annoying. My second flaw is with the power/pairing button. It takes like 6 seconds of holding in the power button to turn them off. Which, personally, is a bit much. I think this is because when you hold the button to turn it off, it tries to pair a device before turning off. Again, not a huge deal. My third, and biggest issue, might be a technical flaw in my pair, I am not sure. Every so often, the sound goes out and gets very ""grainy"" or the sound will get ""stuck"" and repeat the same thing over and over. I know it is the headphones because once I turn them off, the sound is fine. I am not sure why it's happening but the headphones were only $23 so I'm not too mad about it...I wanted a cheap pair of headphones for traveling, and this is a great option. They are great quality headphones, but I won't be disappointed if they break. Minus the technical flaw, I'm happy with my purchase.",1
2.0,Plus the sound isn't as good as my corded LogiTech G230 pair,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"I have huge ears and these crush them after a short amount of time so I rarely use them.  Plus the sound isn't as good as my corded LogiTech G230 pair.  I bought them because I was sick of the cord getting tangled, but still use the other pair because they feel and sound better...edit 5/17/18.Patozon sent me a new pair of headphones and has outstanding customer service.  Unfortunately my ears are very large and this model is simply uncomfortable for me.  I wish my review of the product didn't negatively reflect upon the seller.",1
4.0,Definitely recommend,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"I bought these because I wanted a decently priced pair of headphones that would go with the iPhone 7. My husband had bought me a really nice pair of wired headphones 2 years ago for Christmas and I didn't want to replace those, so with the price and reviews of these bluetooth headphones, I went for it. I was blown away by the sound quality, considering the price. You can tell that these might be a little fragile, so just make sure you take care of them. I got them for when I travel and I want to be able to charge my phone and continue to listen to music/TV shows/movies. Overall, I would definitely recommend these.",1
4.0,A bit tight on my big head,"September 23, 2018",Yes,"The are are too tight on my big head so I can't wear them for very long, but they are great for the money, so I'll give them to my sister when I can replace them. Bought these because I lost a much more expensive pair and can't function without them..I have owned the Beats wireless studio headphones and JBL Bluetooth headphones as well and these sound better than both.  Honestly, only the original Beats were any good, the ones they've had for the last several years since the company blew up are all quite cheaply made and just a name.  My $400 Sony's were definitely better than these, but at least they measure up to Beats! :)",0
5.0,Impressive!,"October 20, 2018",Yes,"I have a Dell 24 inches All-in-One computer, I always use it for watching movies, TV shows,.....etc.  I don't want to sit too close to it since it is not good for the eyes; therefore, I look for a good quality of wireless headphone, so that I can sit far away from it and enjoy...I have found out there are lots of positive reviews of this headphone.  It looks good in the appearance, several different colors to choose from, and the price is pretty attractive, so I go ahead to purchase one to give it a try...It is my first time to use Mpow product.  My first impression is:  Pretty good!  What a surprise!  I always think the quality, appearance, performance, and reliability may be average for me.  When I receive this product and try it, it is out of my expectation.  Not only I like how it looks (the color is sharp!), but also I enjoy the sound quality and the noise cancellation it comes with.  Wow!  Amazing!  I admit although I am not an except in the sound (how well/bad), I am an audiophile.  It does sound good overall!  I like it!  If the bass is a little better, it will be wonderful!..Overall, I enjoy this product so far.  Last but not least, thank you very much for the prompt delivery from the seller.  I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a budget with better than average headphone, it is the one you should get.  I understand different people have different preferences; however, you won't be disappointed with this product.",0
5.0,Great headphones for a Low Price,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"Very impressed with these headphones for the price I paid for them. I got sick of purchasing cheap headphones just to get by and I wanted to splurge a bit, but not too much. These came up as highly rated, and I was not disappointed. First and foremost the sound quality is very good-- it comes out clean and crisp, with a good range of volume. Setting up the bluetooth and the controls was very easy, and the range is decent. I've had trouble with other wireless headsets that cut out while moving between rooms, and I've not had any issues with these. They're made of what seems to be quality material, and they sit comfortably and don't irritate my ears after long periods of wear. I also liked the color, aesthetically, probably my only regret is that the pink ones I wanted were sold out at the time I purchased these! I'd recommend these to anyone wanting quality but on a budget.",1
5.0,If you like over the ear headphones you will love these.,"June 20, 2018",Yes,"Don't claim to be an audiophile but these headphones sound great!  What is more important is that my very ""pickey"" 15 year old music loving grandson liked them so much that when the first pair I bought him was stolen he asked me to order him another pair.  (He paid for the second pair which tells you that he valued them enough to spend his own money.)..I also can't speak too highly of Patozon.  They quickly honored the warranty on a set of in ear Mpow Bluetooth phones that I purchased for myself.  I promptly re-purchased an updated Mpow product as a replacement...Love the products and love the seller.",0
5.0,Worth a second chance!,"December 8, 2017",Yes,Had to send the first set back....malfunctioned...I immediately ordered a new set cause they are awesome! (I did receive a refund)....works like it should...good range....the audio quality is the best I've ever encountered with a Blue Tooth device and I have used many....the ear pieces fit me (they are usually too small for my size 71/4 head)...and they cut off all outside noise....all connections are clearly verbalized by audible messages from the headset..A little spendy but well well worth the investment.,1
3.0,They were slightly too tight on my ears but not uncomfortable and may have got better with more use,"October 13, 2017",Yes,"I ended up returning these, but it was a close call.  Big issues: the bass, as several has commented, is too soft in the mix (and I'm far from a ""Beats"" person).  And I would have preferred a little higher maximum volume.  They were slightly too tight on my ears but not uncomfortable and may have got better with more use.  On the plus side: the sound was otherwise really good and they seemed well constructed.  I'm new to bluetooth headphones but I suspected I was being forced to sacrifice - for now I'm keeping the cord.",1
4.0,"They sound great, they look great","July 5, 2018",Yes,"They sound great, they look great, they are easy to use and the battery lasts all day, but the plastic on top is easy to break and I've had to just decomission my second purchase of these headphones due to how fragile they are after taking them on and off my head a bunch of times...Edit: I was sent a replacement pair from MPOW and so far, the replacement pair has been working perfectly.  I am a little more cognizant of not pulling the earphones off my head by putting a lot of stress on them.  The headphones last all day and still sound great.  I'm updating my review score to 4 stars thanks to MPOWs customer service and my experience with the replacement pair.",0
4.0,Breaking them made them better,"October 27, 2017",Yes,"Perfect headphones AFTER I made an adjustment. They were slightly too snug around my head, so I slowly spread the headband hoping to stretch them out. What happened was plastic tabs popped out just below the silver metal band on both sides, making the fit much looser and far more comfortable. So basically breaking them made a 3-star purchase into a 4-star. The curse of having a larger than average brain.",2
5.0,Got the pink ones and I'm satisfied!,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"The build, the color and the battery life is killer with these babies. I absolutely love them. The only thing with these headphones is they don't have allot of base but once I go through my phone and mess with my built-in equalizer that's a whole other story. The battery has never ran down on me either but I keep them charged anyway. I had to get another pair of bluetooth headphones after my other ones started acting up after months of buying them but that was a whole other brand and I'm very pleased with these and I don't have to deal with that annoying disconnect because these are much more powerful.",0
5.0,HAPPY CUSTOMER,"March 6, 2018",Yes,"***UPDATE***.I received replacement today, customer service contacted me... really, what company takes the time of contacting customers when they are not completely satisfied? THEY DO... Patozon sent me an email informing me that I should be getting my replacement soon, (without asking for a replacement). I can tell you that I am so happy with them, and for sure will be buying more from them, their number 1 priority is customer satisfaction, and I am completely satisfied... Highly recommend..***ORIGINAL POST***.Let me start by saying that I was in love with this headphones, I bought a $250 ones for my husband and to me, this were much much better, that until they stoped charging... I only used them a few times on my free time (like once a week) but sadly can't use them any more",0
2.0,Great sound...but won't always connect to my bluetooth device,"April 13, 2018",Yes,"This is related to folks wanting to watch/listen to TV via Bluetooth with these. The positives are great sound with good range of highs and lows. Also, the noise cancelling is pretty good, almost too good; I can't hear my wife calling me from the next room. The negatives are; for TV watching and lounging the earpieces are a bit bulky. I found when laying down on my couch with my head on a pillow the earpieces feel crowded. Also noticed when laying down the Bluetooth connectivity was a bit choppy. Almost like if anything is around the earpiece the signal is being blocked. Finally, my jaw was hurting a little after about an hour. The spring keeping the headset pressed against your ears is a little tight...Update: I ended up returning this. It was having issues connecting to my bluetooth device. About half the time I would have to resync instead of it auto connecting as it should.",0
5.0,Very Happy,"May 21, 2017",Yes,Their Loud and Comfortable on my ears.  Really like and is enjoying them.. Thanks,16
4.0,Best bang for your buck imo,"March 15, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these after reading numerous reviews on them, and my only complaint is the bass is not as powerful as other headphones I've tried; however, for the price point, you can't beat this quality. The range is fantastic, once paired with a phone it syncs immediately when turned on, and battery life is phenomenal (I use these in the gym 5-6 days a week for 1-2 hours per session, and I charge these once a week). The fit is great, they hold up even during plyometric or explosive movements (I use them while jumping rope, heavy lifting, and calisthenic workouts), and they handle noise cancelling very well. Would highly recommend if you're on a budget or need something strictly for exercise so you can keep your $300+ headphones pristine.",0
5.0,Great Bluetooth headphones-very sturdy materials,"October 22, 2017",Yes,"Great Bluetooth headphones-very sturdy materials, not cheap-better constructed than other “high end” brands  for sure...These are exactly what a $30 pair of good headphones sounds like. The fact that they’re over ear &amp; blue tooth and  I’m not sure if they’re advertised as ANC, but I can’t hear a thing when I’m wearing them are all a huge plus...These are not $500 studio headphones for an audiophile.....but an audiophile should know this fact based off the excellent price. Have I heard clearer and more bass in other overear headphones? Yes, but for $400 more....for my needs, the extra bass and clarity does not justify the price of higher costing headphones. (Don’t misconstrue what I’m saying, these are good sounding headphones,they’re exactly what I hoped and more than I expected for Bluetooth headphones at this price point)..Highly recommend for someone looking for a good sounding, great durability Bluetooth over ears at a great price. Would recommend to an friend and would def buy again.",1
5.0,Mostly blocks screaming baby noises,"May 24, 2017",Yes,"I am very pleased with these. My absolute favorite feature is that if the battery ever dies they come with an optional audio cable so I can use them no matter what...I'm not enough of an audiophile to tell whether the quality is great or not, but it sounds good to me and they're relatively comfortable for such chunky headphones...I'm wearing them on a long bus ride right now and I can barely even hear the screaming baby behind me, so as far as I'm concerned these headphones are doing they're job just fine...For the price I overall feel I got a great pair of headphones, super pleased",2
4.0,"Good Buy, Great Price","December 29, 2017",Yes,"Pretty good product for the price. I needed headphones for my hubby to wear at night because I go to bed earlier than him. I want to make clear that if you are buying these for a TV, you have to buy the mpow adapter to plug into your TV so it syncs with your headphones. It is the only way you can make these work with a tv.  It does have a bit of static background noise, but I am glad I bought them. They are super comfortable and has great sound (minus the minor static background that occasionally happens).",1
5.0,A Good Alternative To Beats Headphones,"February 4, 2018",Yes,"I was contemplating about dropping a few hundred on the Beats headphones when I saw these. I received them immediately once I placed the order. The Bluetooth connectivity works seamlessly with my iPhone and the volume/pause controls on the right ear piece is simple and easy to operate. I like the fact that after a 10 minute charge the headphones last for up to five hours of listening and playback. The headband is adjustable and the cushions are soft to the ears and sturdy. They're perfect for cancelling external noise and the audio is clear. They may appear bulky, but when I tried them on, they felt light and comfortable. The packet comes with a 3.5mm jack and USB charging cable.  I just hope they last a long time!",0
4.0,Good headphone but Weighted and Pairing issue with Computer,"June 9, 2017",Yes,These are pretty good headphones. nice looking and good sound quality. Also the Customer Service is really good (I have added an additional star just for the customer Service)..The only drawback is they are way too heavy and if paired with a computer they cannot be paired with another device (however the company claims that it can be paired with two devices at a time). Because of the  weight and pairing issue I had to return them.,2
5.0,First such pair and I love.,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"I'm not an audiophile but I do appreciate being able to hear the instrumental side of my music. This is the perfect product for me and anyone else looking for a cheap bluetooth headset. I often get headaches and I wear glasses but these headphones did not bother me. I used them for hours at a time for lectures for bar prep and they were also perfect for that. My nephew uses them and says they sound nice to him too - so it's teenager approved. Also, they pair up perfectly every time to laptop, kindle, and android...none of that unpairing and repairing, which I appreciate.",0
2.0,If sound quality is import upgrade to their newer version.,"June 30, 2018",Yes,They look nice and they’re comfortable but the sound quality is horrible. I have to turn the volume up all the way to hear it and everything sounds like it’s in a tin can. My husband put the packaging out with the recycling otherwise I would have returned them...UPDATE * The company was very nice to send out a new set of headphones (MPOW 2) and the sound quality is much much better. The headband portion doesn’t fit as nicely as the original set I ordered and the ear padding isn’t as comfortable as the original set. I wish I had the comfort &amp; fit of the original set and the sound quality of the second set.,0
5.0,Perfect and Exceeded Expectations!,"June 22, 2017",Yes,"My daughter has been having some ear issues and her doctor recommended she stop using earbuds. She's always preferred earbuds because headphones were too bulky. Even so, she looked these up and instantly fell in love with them. Not too sure if love at first sight is real, but she just opened them up about and she's definitely still or even more in love with them. For starters she, or rather we both, (1) love the color red. (2) Fits nice and snug. (3) Super comfortable. (4) Wireless and fold-up convenience. She's currently in college and wears glasses if that helps with any decisions, but definitely recommend!",1
3.0,"Frustrating pairing experience, tinny sound. Will return them.","January 22, 2018",Yes,"The main problem is the one button control to power on, pair, disconnect, and power down. You hold the button for a corresponding amount of time. to do the desired task. For example, 3 second to turn on, 4 seconds to pair, 5 second to disconnect and 6 to turn off. This means getting them paired and not then immediately disconnected from your phone is challenging to say the least as the button is not quite sensitive enough and I constantly heard the ""paired"" command and then the ""disconnected"" command. Often I would accidentally turn them off when trying to pair. It's a very frustrating experience and I often just used the 3.5mm jack which defeats the purpose of the bluetooth...The sound is pretty tinny and uninspiring. You seems to get what you pay for. I got the blue color and in person it's quite light, very near baby blue...They are pretty comfortable to wear and the 3.5 jack is great for use on airlines in-seat entertainment systems. I tested these over 2 weeks with flights to and from the USA and China wearing them for 6-7 hour stretches at a time before noticing discomfort. Battery life seems good, only charged once...Overall, I will be attempting to return these as I'm not happy with my purchase.",1
5.0,Hard to beat the value!,"January 8, 2018",Yes,"I've used these headphones for a couple of months now and am very satisfied with them. I'm thinking of buying my wife a pair too. I mainly use them for listening to music at work, or streaming video in the evening...Here are the highlights:. - While connected over Bluetooth, I no longer have to deal with a cord getting in the way of my keyboard or mouse. - Great price! I thought about looking at Bose or Beats, but thought I would give these low cost a try first. - Great sound. I love music, but wouldn't call myself an audiophile. The sound from these meets my needs and helps me to block out office noise in order to focus on work. - Great battery life. I haven't tracked the exact time between recharges, but I would say I use them for a couple of hours most days of the week and I only have to recharge every other week.. - Good build quality and materials. The headset feels solid, not too heavy, fits comfortably on my head, and the ear covers are very soft...It's very hard for me to come up with any negatives, especially at this price.",1
4.0,Amazing headphones for the price.,"May 12, 2017",Yes,"I love these headphones. They are basically the knock-off version of a $150 other brand pair my wife bought me for my birthday last year. And these are much cheaper and better quality. My old $150 pair broke within a month and were completely useless within one year...Pros: good quality, good sound, the easy access to controls on the side of the headset to pause, play, etc. connects easily to Bluetooth...Cons: perhaps I haven't delved into the instructions well enough but with my old pair, the headset would automatically turn itself off if not in use, but this brand doesn't do that. This means the battery life drains constantly. With my old headset I could go weeks without charging, but with this pair, only a few days...Other than the headset not turning itself off to save battery, I have no complaints about it...Update 7/17/18: I still have this same pair of headphones and I still love them. I’ve found a very easy work around for my prior “con” and it’s to just charge them for 30 mins during my lunch break every day. I haven’t had to truly charge them (from battery depletion during use) for months. Aside from that, one other sight con would be that after MULTIPLE hours of straight use, it did start to eventually make one ear feel uncomfortable, but I can’t imagine this wouldn’t happen with any other pair of very affordable headphones.",1
5.0,"Excellent pair of headphones, highly recommend them.","September 10, 2017",Yes,"Phenomenal price to quality ratio. I own a pair of Bose Quietcomfort 35 headphones as well (~$345) and there are two ways in which the Bose headphones are obviously superior, the noise cancellation and quite frankly the comfort for longer-term listening (hours at a time, such as for a transatlantic flight). But if we set those aside, I have to say, the Mpow headphones absolutely shocked me with the sound quality. I honestly expected nothing from these headphones (merely a good over-ear and wireless option to listen to ocean sounds while studying), but I found myself using them routinely to listen to music. The frequency response is somewhat limited to the midrange but I was surprised by the reach of the bass on some of my hip hop tracks; I had to throw on the equalizer on Spotify to accentuate some of the lower and higher frequencies to get a nice sound for myself, but still, not bad for a $35 pair of headphones. The build quality is actually excellent, waaaay better than I would expect for the price. Solid bluetooth connection, excellent wired option, and the multifunction buttons are well-placed and study. I also took them on a transatlantic flight just to see how they would fare, and quite honestly they did well. The airplane noise was not overwhelming them, the sound came through just fine (actually the highest volume setting was pretty loud), and they were relatively comfortable for long durations. Although they have a bit of a tight fit and can get uncomfortable around the ears if you wear glasses with thick side pieces, they were soft enough when they fit flush against the head when I was wearing contacts. Overall, not a bad option if you are in the market for a lower-end pair of headphones. I wouldn't even go with the ""you get what you pay for"" on this one; I'd say you'll get quite a bit more than you'd think. Although I'll be sticking to my Bose Quietcomforts for most of my actual music listening, these are still definitely worth it for a cheap backup pair.",13
4.0,Pretty good headphones - crack in supporting arm after 6 months.,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"I'm a grocery overnight stocker, and use the headphones to listen to podcasts, and occasionally music. For this purpose they work pretty well. They get banged up and abused quite a bit. I've owned them for 7 months and functionally, they are going strong with the following exception: about a month ago I noticed a fracture along one of the arms (not sure what else to call it). This causes the headphones to sit slightly cockeyed. They still feel solid on my head, but when looking in the mirror I can tell they're just a little... off. If I had paid more for these, I would probably drop the rating down to 3 stars, but honestly, for low cost headphones enduring lots of abuse I feel they've done their job pretty well. The sound quality is acceptable.",0
4.0,Excellent Budget Wireless Over Ear headphones w/ horrendous Noise Cancelling ability,"December 13, 2017",Yes,"*Great news hopefully final update lol*..I am using a Wired connection now (AUX cord AmazonBasics and both sides are emitting sound now crystal clear.  Still having issues with Bluetooth so if by some Divine Miracle those work then Mpow will get 5 stars instead of 4.  Lucky for them I am VERY FORGIVONG lol...*Critical Update* 4/19/2018  - After about a week or using the new black, wireless MPOW Headphones, looks like it has gone defective.  The left earpad no longer emits any type of sound :(  Its unfortunate because when both earpads were working - I really enjoyed using them so will have to give it 3 stars only because the company did make the effort to send me a new pair so will acknowledge that. Womp womp...*Update*  4/12/2018 Mpows parent company shipped me their latest model free of charge :)  I LOVE the sleek, sexy, black design and the simple interface on the ear cup is MASSIVELY BETTER than this red model.  THANK YOU PROTONZON OR WHATEVER UR COMPANY IS CALLED SORRY LOL!!!..3 stars for durability, budget value, sound quality, wireless, style/aesthetic,  and easy bluetooth sync.  Minus two stars for VERY poo.POOR noise cancelling (on a subway you need maximum volume and consequently my ears are in MASSIVE PAIN. The off button is not intuitive and same with the other buttons that are too klunked together.",0
4.0,Great headphones,"June 25, 2017",Yes,"I really like these! They easily connect to the Bluetooth on my phone and my laptop! They're not completely noise canceling but they certainly do a good job...My main criticism is that the power on / off/ pause/ play &amp; connect to Bluetooth are literally all the same button. It all depends on how you push it.... I'm still figuring it out, but I haven't been able to turn it off via button yet. I think it just goes off eventually. And sometimes pausing the music will work but sometimes I have to go to my main device..Otherwise, turning it on and connecting to Bluetooth is super easy.",1
5.0,Great headphones at a great price!,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"Great sound, great fit, exactly what I was looking for!  Ear buds always fall out of my ears (even the over ear hook things) so I wanted to buy some over ear headphones to wear while I work out.  I've had these a little over 6 months &amp; I use them at least 5 times a week while running.  I haven't had a single issue with them.  The control buttons were designed perfectly, easy to use while running.  The Bluetooth hasn't failed me yet!  The sound far surpasses what I expected give the price.  The battery life is great.  I usually charge them once a week, so I'm getting 6-8 hours of use without a low battery.  I don't wait for low battery, so I'm not sure exactly how long they last.  These were a solid purchase!",0
5.0,UPDATE TO: You like how much pain can i take challenges? Buy these!!,"March 24, 2018",Yes,"SEE EDIT BELOW!.I tried to like these. I really did. For the price, the sound is pretty good and I'm an audiophile. I CANNOT wear these for more than 25 minutes without taking the them off for at least 5 minutes. I have an average hat size and ear size. I tried every concievable adjustment point. The cartilage in my ear feels like it was folded into a contact lens case for an hour. Once the pain goes away, I put them back on and they're comfortable again... now only for about 15 minutes. Rise, repeat. These could be improved so easily with better cups..They DO hold a charge for freaking EVER though (though that might be because I don't use them for any length of time...youch)..I'm going to have to stick to my crappy earbuds I guess until I can find something else that fits my ears..Pass on these...UPDATE:.I HAVENT seen this kind of customer service in a LONG time. This company stands by their product. They contacted ME about my unsatisfation. No hassle, prompt returns. They are gonna make it right. They sent me a pair of https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HPB1HQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_NuFZAbD1X39HP which work way better for ME.",0
4.0,Finally an inexpensive brand that actually works!,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"After two disappointing experiences with other brands of Bluetooth headphones, I finally got one that worked properly. I have been using it several times a week with no problems (yet). My previous selections had problems with charging/holding a charge. So far this set is charging well and holding the charge long enough to use for at least a couple of hours. I have not asked them to work beyond two hours at a time. Sound quality is not great. They are heavy on the bass. So much so that they sometimes lose clarity. The highs are weak. Despite the distortion, they serve my purpose well. I use them to connect with my iPhone to play music from my playlists or those of Pandora or Amazon while working out at the gym.",0
4.0,Comfortable with good sound.,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"So far, they work and sound good. The only goofy thing that I found, and it's not a show stopper - just an annoyance, is that to turn them off, you hold the power button for 5 seconds, HOWEVER they go into pairing mode after holding the button for 4 seconds. And if you happen to take your finger off the button in that moment between pairing and off, it takes a little while before you can turn them off for real (locked into pairing until it times out - 5-second hold doesn't seem to work until then).",1
5.0,"Very comfortable, love ‘em","March 7, 2018",Yes,"Great headset and love the sound. It’s clear and crisp. I even changed my music equalizer settings to none and it sounds even better! The only thing that I can find wrong with it is the bass, it is ok, but that is just me. I’m used to my lil earbuds putting out pretty good bass. So for those looking for a decent bass that’s not to loud these are great. Other then that I love them. Very soft and fit my ear well. So far battery life is great. I’ve charged them one time and haven’t had to charge them yet. Even after non use/light use. They are easy to sync with phone but haven’t tried them with comp yet. Overall they are a great headset and I love the blue. Color is true to pic. 😃",0
3.0,Dumb Button Layout and Frequent Fizzle,"September 12, 2018",Yes,"So first of all, these headphones are more than passable, Im pretty happy with them and the sound quality is better than my previous pair. That said, I have some gripes...-Who's bright idea was it to not only make all the buttons on the headphones flush and smooth against the device, but also include a button that auto calls the last person you called, and not have any defining features of bumps or something to easily identify which button is which, so I ended up calling people when I meant to turn up my volume? They went for sleek design and sacrificed readabillity, Im now never going to use the buttons for fear of pressing the wrong one and calling someone. You cant even feel a dip between the buttons to know if youve moved over one and onto another. The buttons are useless to me, thats not the end of the world but its still a pretty stupid yet easily fixed problem they didnt consider...Next, my other issue is that if my phone is in my pocket, sometimes the sound crackles and skips in the headphones. I think it may be if Im near other bluetooth users but it happens far more frequently than my previous pair did...All in all, for the price, not bad, they fit very well on my head and feel comfortable, and the sound doesnt crackle most of the time, but it does do it often enough to bring it up.",0
5.0,Comfortable and qualty sound,"October 21, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this 1 week ago and I use it nightly.  I love that the material around the ear is soft and flexible.  It fits AROUND my ear which I like because it doesn't hurt my ear!  I have a daith piercing for migraines and the in ear headsets were either uncomfortable or I wasn't able to keep them in my ears!  These are a bit on the large size however I don't know how they would be any smaller without being on the ear!  The pad on the top is VERY comfortable as well.  I was worried about the fact that it folds up that it would push in on my head or not fit properly but it doesn't do either, I actually forget once it is on!  All the buttons work and it syncs great with my computer and phone!  I wear them to listen to books and music and the sound quality is fine, it isn't out of this world but sounds fine for the price paid!  I would definitely buy these again and recommend them to anyone looking for an affordable option!",0
2.0,These do not block ANY noise...,"June 9, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality is okay and hey hold a charge for a decent amount of time. However, they do not block out any noise. I can hear people talking at normal office level voices from 2 desks away even with the volume turned up a bit. I would expect to still hear people talking loudly or yelling, but these people are talking quietly in an office and I can still hear them over my music. I may as well just have a radio sitting on my desk playing music. I got these because I work in an office where people care more about socializing/gossiping than working. I needed something to drown out the high school levels of gossiping. These definitely do not do the trick...On a bright side, the color is fantastic!",1
4.0,these are really damn good headphones. I've had a couple of sets and ...,"July 23, 2017",Yes,"For the price, these are really damn good headphones. I've had a couple of sets and compared to the Urbanears they're almost the same sound quality for half the price, and they're Bluetooth. They also come with a connector so if they die because you forgot to charge them you can still listen to them as a wired connector. When you turn them on they connect instantly, no awkward waiting around...2 small issues:.One annoying thing is the volume for the headphones and your phone are different. Meaning if you maxed the volume on your phone, you can still adjust the volume on the headphones. The annoying thing is when you max the volume on the headphones, it beeps and says ""maximum volume reached""..The other thing is while waking the Bluetooth connection will occasionally cut out for a fraction of a second. It doesn't happen always but enough that you notice it...Overall these headphones are great for the price",1
5.0,Attractive for everyday use and long performance time per charge.,"January 13, 2018",Yes,I bought it for my son.  The package was delivered timely.  The box is attractive white.  The quality of box is similar to apple phones.  The manual comes in multiple languages and English portion is of American standard even though he has not read the manual as the headphones are very user friendly right out of the box.  He loves the color and fit.  The quality of material is excellent.  The ear cups are nice and large that covers his entire ear giving it snug and comfortable fit.  Sounds is clear and even from both sizes.  There is a blue light that lights up when headphones connects or disconnect from the source giving visual and audio connection confirmation.  He likes the fact that he can use his headphones with wire that is supplied to use on the phone as our computer does not have built in Bluetooth.  The headphones are keeping charge for a long time and battery gives extended listening time without recharging. The headphones came fully charged in the box.  He has used it for four days without charging.  The product info states they are new version of the product.,1
5.0,Great company that stands behind their products,"August 20, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE: shortly after writing the review I was contacted by Patazon and they are shipping me a new set of headphones. I honestly did not expect such a friendly message and I’m blown away by their speed and customer service...These headphone have been great. Comfortable, good sound quality, perfect price. But 4 months in and the material covering the pad that rests on the top of the band has pulled away from the plastic and I couldn’t be more dissapointed. I loved these headphones, I’ve kept them in their case/bag and I wear them 3ish days a week. 4 months of casual use to all the sudden show this level of damage is ridiculous.",0
5.0,these are fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect since they ...,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"For the price and performance, these are fantastic.  I wasn't sure what to expect since they are low cost; but I use them at work for listening to music as well as participate in online meetings and these have done everything I needed.  I keep forgetting they are wireless, and the freedom I get from being able to walk around my office with them on while still listening on conference calls or to music is great.  They are also extremely comfortable...For the low cost, this is worth trying out for anyone with wireless headset needs.  The sound quality isn't as good as some higher priced headsets I own, but the added benefits (cost, comfort, battery life) make up for it.",0
3.0,I liked this for the first four weeks I owned it,"December 16, 2017",Yes,"I liked this for the first four weeks I owned it, but by the 5th week the control button has fallen off, making it pretty much unuseable.  The button on the headset controls on/off as well as pause and advance. It doesn't simply snap into place, so this is currently an inactive piece of junk. Before it broke, I liked it. It fit comfortably, it paired easily, and the sound quality is good...But the fact it broke within 5 weeks is unacceptable. It was never dropped, it was stored in a safe, clean environment, and it had moderate use...Update 1/10/17: Mpow was very responsive to my concern and has sent me a replacement. I have not put it through a normal stress test to see if the problem I encountered is consistent, but I really appreciate the high level of customer service. I will follow up if/when I have a more thorough review.  I've moved my review from 1 stars to 3 based on the strong customer service.",6
4.0,"Comfortable budget headphones. Snug fit, Okay sound quality.","February 11, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great for the gym. I used to wear  uncomfortable in-ear bluetooth earbuds. I decided to get over ear headphones that were within my budget and these headphones are what I am looking for.  I go to the gym 4 times a week and I always bring these with me. It really makes going to the gym easier. They are comfortable and snug fitting. I am usually very picky about what I place on my head and these do the trick. A minor complaint is about sound quality. The bass is a little muffled and the treble at times can sound boxy, but for budget headphones they are perfectly fine. If you are an audiophile, you may want to pass this up, but for the average buyer, these are great.",0
5.0,These are working great for my workout routine!,"November 24, 2018",Yes,I ordered these to see if they'd work well for my workout music. So far they've been great! The sound quality is very nice and the battery life seems to be holding up very nicely. It's easy to pair up to your phone and the buttons are in great spots. I can turn the music up and down by just a touch on the earpiece as well as fast forward and rewind.,1
5.0,I was surprised how good these headphones sound for the price.,"May 18, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are great!  Great sound, good range while wandering around doing stuff and not worrying about carrying my phone.  I've used my headphones within 30 or so feet and haven't had the disruption I normally experienced with other earbud type Bluetooth headsets.  I use my headphones mostly for audio books and occasional music (wait until you hear Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 on these earphones).  They're comfortable after several hours and have a good battery life.  I got these to use with my hearing aids.  If I use earbuds, I can't use my hearing aids.  But, since these are over ear, they work well.",1
2.0,Good headphones - but uncomfortable and cable stopped working,"October 22, 2018",Yes,"I am always searching for a pair of good, cheap headphones. I bought these and was happy with the design and the audio quality. However, I find these headphones incredibly uncomfortable - the memory foam padding on the band hurts almost like a sharp edge after only an hour of wearing these. But, they were cheap and I liked the audio quality, so I bought a knit sleeve to put on the band and keep on wearing them...I really liked the ability to use the audio cord so I didn't have to worry about keeping them charged, so that was my main way of using them. I did try them bluetooth, and the connection process was easy. However, after only a few months of using these, my audio cable started deteriorating, and the sound would cut out on the left speaker only - I would have to adjust the end of the audio cable in order to get it to come through. Unfortunately, last week the cable finally failed and I now have no sound in the left speaker. It works fine with bluetooth, but I am finding that interference with my bluetooth magic mouse at work makes the sound stutter when trying to use them via bluetooth at work. Since I can't get good sound anymore, I guess that means I need to start searching for another pair of headphones - or buy a new audio cable.",0
2.0,They sound good... of course everyone within 10 feet will know what you are listening too as well and might tell you the same,"March 15, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are comfortable, reasonably attractive, and really quite good at delivering quality music sound at an affordable price. Only problem (and the reason I returned them) everyone around you will tell you how good they sound too... because they can all hear what you are listening too. Even at very reasonable volumes. Which is annoying to anyone not wearing the headphones...which means they really fail at their primary purpose..being headphones...for you.. not an external speaker ..for all.....I returned mine for another set I was comparing that sounded as good...unfortunately were more expensive... but held the music in.",0
4.0,Good headphones for the price,"April 27, 2017",Yes,"Been using these headphones for few weeks now, and I like them. Bought them for the office as I share office with a colleague who is quite loud :-)..With music on they block out most outside noise, with music off I can hear pretty much everything around me, but then these are not active noise cancelling headphones..They sound a bit muffled, and too much on bass to my taste..Battery seems to be OK, I charge them once in several days (but then I don't listen to music many hours, maybe a couple of hours a day)..They are comfortable to wear, heavier than I thought but that's not a big issue...Overal I like these headphones, especially for the price.",1
5.0,I was nervous about them being comfortable for her because she wears plastic frame glasses,"January 8, 2018",Yes,"Got a pair of these for my girlfriend for the holiday season and she loves them. I was nervous about them being comfortable for her because she wears plastic frame glasses, but the headphones fit her comfortably. These things can get extra loud when they're wireless (with individual volume for her phone and headphones), so I guess if you wanted to get these for kids, I'd be weary about how loud they can get. Other than that, these things are good quality at a reasonable price. Now I want a pair!..**Also: I ordered these in less than a week before x-mas and they still came in two days (even though the expectation said otherwise), so kudos to the truck drivers :)",1
4.0,... just relax and listen to music or watch a good movie. The headphone helps me to do this,"December 23, 2017",Yes,"I work with children and look forward to the day when I am off from work to just relax and listen to music or watch a good movie. The headphone helps me to do this. Once you put it on nothing else matters, you feel like you are right there where the music is playing or the movie is taking place. It truly reduces background noise. it sits nice and comfortable on your ears. I would have given it 5 🌟 but I not sure how the material will hold up. I will keep you updated.",1
3.0,DO NOT buy it for gaming and in-game chat,"November 5, 2017",Yes,"DO NOT buy it for gaming and in-game chat. If you use it for movie, music. The sound quality is good and stereo. Good for the price. But when you need to use the Mic to chat. It's just 1 channel, 8000hz instead of the Stereo(2 channel, 44100hz). I playing PUBG, the mic won't work in stereo mode and only work for hands-free mode. So the sound quality is Horrible...In windows 10, right click on the speaker icon in the right corner, choose playback devices and you will see Mpow-059 Stereo and Mpow-059 Hands-free two different profile. Right click and choose properties, you will see the differences...I google it. Seems like Bluetooth headsets with build-in Mic all has this problems.

The sound on this Mpow 059 to me indistinguishable except as noted maybe lighter on bass but actually better for my tastes.  No noise cancelling but I don't need or want that function. This is lightweight, easy to use, long battery. It has totally changed how I listen to music, TV, talk on my mobile phone.  I ditched my work head set and use this only. Update: I love so much I own 2 just purchased for my father that wears hearing aides. He is crazy happy can listen to music, TV and make telephone calls difficult when putting phone to ear but good with earphones.",0
3.0,This is good headphones but there are some bad parts that I ...,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"This is good headphones but there are some bad parts that I faced after having it on for a while that I noticed. There are three main things that I really thought these headphones can improve on which was starting with the sound equality which was good but I believe it could have been better. Another, was the static noise that I always heard when I either opened up my keyboard on iPhone and when music was playing (just annoying when typing and not listening music). Also, this might be my fault but there is a blue blue light that constantly flickers and it is very annoying at night. I read the manual it said couple of vague stuff about it like it was music, low battery, etc. I’ve done what I can to make it stop but it still exists. (Yes I fully charged it for 4 hours)..The good thing I loved about the headphones was the design. The design is the best I like it SOO much. The material is best to be expected. They are comfortable. The pairing process, the fact I have a charging icon shown on top of my iPhone, the moment I power the headphones on it connects, etc. These are things I liked.",1
5.0,Perfect if you want to watch TV and your hubby or kid wants to sleep in the same room,"August 3, 2017",Yes,"I love these!  I can watch TV while my 3 yr old sleeps in the room with me..They are comfy at first, but then become a little uncomfortable on your ears if you wear them for a few hours like I do.  I solved this by just placing the headphones above my ears and turning my TV volume WAY up.  Then you hear it well, but the headphones don't hurt your ears when you're trying to go to sleep with the TV on.  It also doesn't cause eardrum damage that way..Only downside is that the instructions are not that good.  It took me a few days before I figured out how to use it.  My 13 year old electronics genius nephew was even confused when I had to ask him for help.",1
4.0,For the price these are super easy to use and pretty comfortable,"May 4, 2017",Yes,"For the price these are super easy to use and pretty comfortable. I had to get over the ear headphones to block out my cubical neighbors at work since they have no filter and are rather loud all day talking about things I care less about. So far they are loud as usual, and I can't hear them at all with these headphones on. Love it! I like that they are collapsible, not heavy, easy to set up and use and wireless! I have a pair of Powerbeats  which were great, but they didn't block out sound at all, these for a 4th of the cost are so amazing.",2
4.0,Great headphones,"August 12, 2018",Yes,"I didn't have any trouble syncing my device to Bluetooth and the sound is great. People complained about the bass in the comments, but I think it's actually pretty good, and though there is no actual noise cancellation in the electronics, the seal is good enough that it pretty much blocks all external sound anyway. The price is right and the ear pads are very comfortable. I haven't had it long enough to know how well the battery is going to last and endure over time. The only problem I've had is that the top pad could be a little thicker, as it makes the top of my head sore more quickly than other headphones.",0
5.0,Best headphones I have owned,"August 10, 2018",Yes,"I wear headphones at work for long periods to both drown out the noise from co-workers and also to aid in concentration when I am working. I previously had a pair of Beats (solo 2), but they were hot and tight on my head so it was difficult to wear them for extended periods.  I have had the Mpow 059 headphones for three days now and have basically worn them for most of those days. Overall the sound is MUCh better than the Beats, and I couldn't be happier with them. It's not surprising these are the highest rated bluetooth headphones on Amazon, everything that people say about them is true.",0
5.0,"Great buy, even for a skeptic like me that got his ears singed by cheap ass wireless headphone.....these are great sound.","April 29, 2018",Yes,Out of the box pluses are that is a really comfortable headset and it looks quality of my older Dr. Dre beats pain vivid green.  It does not have an indicator that shines green however there is a red light that shuts off when its fully charged.  Watched on my computer and on my iphone and found that quality was really great using the phone maybe due the mixer?.The biggest plus is the bass is great especially if you do ROGUE or crossfit stuff these stay on for the most part (I have a big ass head) so maybe that had something to do with it..Lastly...these were neither free or do I sponsor or get monetary compensation for these.,0
5.0,Mpow hits the mark,"October 25, 2017",Yes,"I picked up this headphone to use when I work out.  I like the over ear as opposed to earbuds, and this is extremely comfortable, and seems to give very clean sound. The telephone portion works nicely, and has delivered clear speech in and out.  I am very happy with this purchase, especially since my last one died after a relatively short time ... I anticipate more from this Mpow.  Fits great, earpads are comfortable, sound is quite nice, balances well for my workout ... have nothing but good to say.",1
4.0,Can't beat it for the price!  Great entry level over-the-ear BT Headphones.,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are great.  Pairs super fast with my MacBook Pro, and they sound really good.  I do not play music at super high volumes, but the frequency range is good, as well a really good for podcasts and audiobooks.  I use them at work to help filter out background noises.  While NOT noise canceling headphones, the over-the-ear design naturally filters out a lot of the more disruptive sounds.  The only issue is the poor sound quality when in headset mode, which is why I dropped a start on the rating.  I didn't get these to use for communication, but I'd would use that feature if the audio quality in that mode was better.",0
2.0,Incompatible with Windows 7,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"I purchased an MPOW 059 a couple weeks ago. I paid a little extra for this one over some other options because the reviews of the device's customer service were good, so I figured if I had any issues, I'd be set--call it insurance...The headset's bluetooth is NOT compatible with Windows 7 without a Bluetooth 4.0 dongle (not included). The company never mentions this. Furthermore, the mic is only functional in wireless mode, which means the mic is also inoperable with Windows 7. Again, that is not mentioned anywhere on the seller's page...The audio cable isn't quite long enough. It needs an extra foot or so for my set-up. The headset comes with a short USB charging cable, but you have to connect it to your own wall adapter--it's not included for some bizarre reason. It does stay charged for a very long time when connected via cable...The earpieces are soft and cushy as described, and it fits my normal-sized head only a little tighter than I'd prefer...As far as the sound goes, for the most part, it's very nice, with some notable exceptions. The quality of the bass and treble sound extremely professional, though midrange is somewhat lacking. There is a faint, high-pitched whine in mine, but it's really only audible at silent points. One other issue that I have is that there's about a 1/4 second delay, even with the cable, which puts people's mouths out of sync and would drive gamers out of their minds due to slower reaction times...I cannot assess the quality of the mic, since it's not functional...Customer service was quick to respond: their suggestion was that I give the headset away as a gift, or they can refund me $3 for my trouble. ""If [I] insist on returning it back,"" I could return it via Amazon. What the snot, company. Take some credit for your product...All in all, I have decided to return this product. I got it for the mic, and I don't feel like shelling out an additional $15 for a Bluetooth 4.0 adapter just for this headset--it has too many other problems.",0
4.0,Issues with Bluetooth connectivity when using USB 4.0 dongle,"March 7, 2018",Yes,"Bought a 4.0 USB dongle for my computer because I had no onboard Bluetooth.  These paired up with the dongle in Windows 10 just fine, and worked at first.  Then I got the weirdest cutting out - it would cut out certain parts of the volume in my games (like just cut out the music, but not other parts of the sound.  Sometimes it would just stop being connected altogether.  I moved my mouse dongle away from the headphones dongle due to possible interference (though Bluetooth 4.0 should be able to avoid interference once paired...).  I have wired MPOW headphones that work great - shame that these have problems.  They are very comfortable and snug...EDIT: I'm currently in process of switching out the Bluetooth dongle, as this may be causing these problems.  Will change my review if it is fixed...EDIT: Recently tried a more expensive Bluetooth dongle, which also has very poor sound quality.  Tried with onboard bluetooth on my phone, and it sounds great.  Likely an issue with Bluetooth dongles, but the inability to use these headphones with a Bluetooth dongle makes these headphones a no-go.  You may want to make sure you have onboard Bluetooth...EDIT: Seller has contacted me several times in an attempt to resolve the issue.  Very happy with these attempts, though I ended up purchasing wireless headset with proprietary dongle, as the connection is much better...EDIT: The company sent me a free pair.  I can use them with anything that has onboard bluetooth and they are very comfortable - decent sound quality.  Not recommended for bluetooth dongle pairing.",0
4.0,"Cheap, worked, rattle, manufacturer defect.","January 2, 2018",Yes,"These headphones were great with the exception of something rattling around inside the left earmuff. Complete disassembly was required in order to remove the particle. The rattle turned out to be a rogue peice of plastic inside the speaker housing which could not be removed without cutting away the speaker grill. (See image, staple for size comparison)...It would appear quality control is poor, do not purchase unless you are willing to put up with annoying defects...Update:..I was contacted by the manufacturer after leaving my review of the defective set of headphones. They sent me a replacement set with no effort on my half. Very happily surprised with the customer service, rating changed from 2 to 4 stars!",2
5.0,MPOW has some gerat options,"February 10, 2018",Yes,"These are OK.  For the price, they are not bad.  the buttons feel like cheap plastic and the sound is OK.  I ended up returning them as the buttons feel like they are going to break when you press them.  My plan is to purchase another model of the Mpow brand as they have a few sets with solid reviews.  These could be good for light use or for children.  Not the best fit for me...Update from 3/6 - After posting a 3 star review, the manufacturer reached out to me direct to remedy the situation.  I have since purchased a pair of MPow H4 as well as H2 and they are outstanding for the price. I would highly recommend the H4's and the H2 are a pretty darn good back up.",0
5.0,"Decent sound quality, work well with Google pixel phone, excellent battery life.","October 7, 2018",Yes,"These headphones connect very fast and have good sound quality over Bluetooth from my pixel phone, although the bass is a little low and it seems to get muddied if I try to adjust the equalizer (in Google play music app) so I've just left it on the default settings. They seem to have finer volume adjustment than my previous headphones which made excessively large jumps in volume when used with the pixel phone due to a flaw in Google's design which they refuse to fix. The Mpow's are much better and mostly hide the issue and I almost don't even care to bother Google about fixing it any longer. So far these Mpow's have had excellent battery life too because I don't even remember when I last charged them yet I've used them for a few hours almost every day.",0
5.0,Great sounding headphones,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"I am a DJ by trade, so as you can imagine I have a few sets of headphones. Some that are wired and some that are Bluetooth. My DJ headset are top-of-the-line v-moda and I will never go away from those for DJing. But for listening to music, in the first 5 minutes I gave this m p o w and absolute five star. It seamlessly sync to my phone and the volume is as loud as you can get it. I like my music loud I can't stand it when headphones have an auto gain on there and won't go over a certain level. These headphones are excellent. And they feel more like $100 headphones than $34 headphones. I'm glad I bought this set.",0
3.0,"Good sound, fair price.","March 4, 2018",Yes,"Very good sound.  Others have commented--- and it is true--- that finding the control buttons while it is on your head is difficult.  I printed out some letters on Dymo raised letter tape and put them on so I can ""feel"" where the buttons are....much better.  Somewhat laborious to mate it each time I turn on my Bluetooth device.  It would be nice if it would ""auto mate"" after the first time. I was also under the impression that the ear muffs could be swiveled so they would lay flat.....they don't.  They turn inward to somewhat decrease the packing size, but turning to ""flat"" would be a whole lot better.  Fairly priced.",0
2.0,"I purchased this headphone on December 17, 2017, ...","April 6, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this headphone on December 17, 2017,  It began to fail two weeks ago -- March 15 to 20.  It no longer connects with the bluetooth transmitters on the devices I have.  The Cowin headset I also bought at the same time continues to work well...UPDATE:  The Mpow company sent me, with my asking, a new set of Mpow 059 Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear.  The new ones work fine.  I appreciate the response from Mpow.  They sent it without any request from me.  I appreciate it very much and say I am much impressed by the response directly from the company on the basis only of my complaint.  I am impressed by the quick response by Mpow though I did not complain the them. Mpow is a good company which stands by their merchandise.  -- Dr. Rex Stevens",0
2.0,VERY uncomfortable.,"February 15, 2018",Yes,"What is with all the great reviews for this product?  The sound is and the features are great.  But it has to be the most uncomfortable headset I've ever worn.  Only about 10 minutes in to wearing them and I have a bad headache.  The padding between my skull and the top of this headset is virtually non existent.  If you can't comfortably wear them what's the point?  I guess I'll have to stop buying these cheap alternatives and finally spend some decent money to get a good product.  You know that saying, ""you get what you pay for""?  Well, this is it...My headphones were replaced FREE OF CHARGE by Mpow, so I am very pleased, customer service is awesome.",0
5.0,Ah-Mah-Zing!,"February 17, 2018",Yes,"I dont even know where to begin! These are just like my Bose headphones but the only difference is theyre Pink! I am honestly shocked and Ah-mazed!!!!! Im listening to my EDM mix on full blast and I feel like I am in a club. The base is strong, and the sound is clear. The ear portions fit nicely with my earings on and are snug, comfortable. Will update with reviews on the battery life and lifespan after a month but if you need a decision now, do it!!!",1
5.0,We're an Mpow family now,"June 20, 2018",Yes,"I received the same pair of headphones (in red) for a Christmas present and love them. They are way better (especially for the price) than other Bluetooth headphones I tried...After my husband broke his third pair of earbuds while working out (from sweating on them), I ordered him a set too. His runs are much more enjoyable because they stay put (unlike the earbuds) and (we hope) he can't sweat on any electronic parts...Charge lasts a long time (at least 12 hours, maybe more) and sound quality is decent. Included headphone jack cord is pretty long if you want to use them plugged in.",0
5.0,"Very comfortable over-ear, good battery life, good sound.","August 16, 2017",Yes,"These are REALLY comfortable OVER ear headphones. Had them for 2 weeks now. Battery life is long enough to last about 5 days of on and off use during the work week. Will update if that changes. Takes a little while to charge, seems like at least 4-5 hours, but not a big deal. Bass is pretty good and music sounds great. I wish the other colors were the same price, but red was $33, Grey and Black was $36, and Green was $38 so I just figured Red can't be that bad and saved a few $$. I would recommend from having tried a few brands while looking for Bluetooth headphones around $30.",1
2.0,Low sounds quality on bluetooth + uncomfortable,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"I got these after reading the reviews. But did not like them:.1. After 5 mins, my head started hurting from the top cushion. It was a bit tight on the ears too. I have an average sized head so had a friend (small head) try them on and they observed the same thing..2. The sound quality was not as good when on bluetooth.",2
5.0,Three Stars,"January 4, 2018",Yes,***Updated rating: In this day and age it seems far too often that good customer service is non-existent and when you write a review or contact a Company it's just going to some dark hole where no one ever sees it.  This seller has restored my faith in good customer service.  They contacted me right away after I posted my review!!  They went WAY above and beyond to figure out a solution to turn me into a satisfied customer.  I am so impressed and will most definitely purchase from them again in the future!  Amazing service!!!!..Original review: Great sound and easy to set up bluetooth. Kills my ears after only a short time of wearing them.,1
4.0,Versatile,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"I bought this to wear at my cubicle during the day. This works great for listening for shorter periods, but if I wear them for most of the work day my ears do get a little bit sore. The sound quality seems good. I like how they fold up and how it came with a bag. It's nice having the option to use them as Bluetooth or with the cord.",2
4.0,What a disappointment.,"September 4, 2018",Yes,"This is now my third time trying out Mpow bluetooth headphone products and I continue to be let down. Returning because when I use these headsets everyone has complained that they can barely hear me which makes them useless. I really wanted to like them...Update: So, this is really a great company. After reading my review they refunded me my money and sent me a newer version of their bluetooth headset. So far the newer version is working great and everyone I talked to can hear me loud and clear! Will continue to monitor these headsets.",0
5.0,Kids and adults both approve.,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"I like these headphones.  This is our second pair after trying another color out last year for a vacation with our kids.  They are a bit bulky but comfortable to wear.  I can wear them, but my kids like them as well.  I like that they fold and I really like that they can plug into a device as well in case you either don’t have Bluetooth on a device or the battery gets low - a feature which is hard to find in headphones.  We have only ever used them for about 3 hours straight at a time so I can’t comment on the actual battery life.",0
5.0,MPOW is WOW!,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"I just received my MPOW headphones day before yesterday, I can't say enough good things about them.  $33.99-really?  What a great price for such a high quality product, sound reproduction is certainly more than adequate, it's downright good.  Fit is comfortable for me (and I wear glasses). It came with simple instructions and after I fiddled with it for about 2 minutes I had it paired to my iPad.  Control panel makes sense and is easy to use while wearing the phones.  I think I am going to buy a second pair Because they are such a good deal.",1
4.0,Weak Power Button,"September 27, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphones for my son 6 months ago. I thought the sound quality was great for the price, decent battery life, and very comfortable. However, the power button easily falls off. I snapped it back into place, but it would soon fall back off. Eventually, I could not snap it back on. Aside from that issue, I thought they were good headphones. I gave a low rating because my son can no longer use them after 6 months...****UPDATE 10/4/18****.I initially gave one star. Without even requesting it, I came home to find a brand new pair in my mailbox. I am very impressed, so I bumped my review up to 4 stars.",1
4.0,Unless you want to replace it every few months buy something else,"July 1, 2018",Yes,"Horrible product. It lasted me some months and now will not turn on at all. Sound is alright when it did work but it has issues turning on and connecting to devices. It worked just fine for the first two months but then it worked when it wanted to and now it's not even turning on. Waste of money. It looked pretty though if that matters...Edit: excellent customer service, they sent me a new one. I'll have to try it out and see how well it works.",1
4.0,Cat-proof,"April 22, 2017",Yes,"Pretty good for my purposes (podcasts and phone calls, not music). Good battery life, *great* range. I can be 40 feet away behind some big old fireproof cabinets and they still don't cut out. Most importantly, there's no exposed wires for my demon cat to chew through...Cons: They can get pretty uncomfortable, as I have glasses and large-ish piercings, but it's not unbearable. I There's also no apparent way to check battery levels, and the voice feedback is WAY too loud.",2
5.0,Good headphone for the price.,"August 26, 2017",Yes,"I bought these headphones after trying some others. I had some Beats, but I didn't like how often I had to charge them. I've shopped around a bit and finally landed on these. I like a headphone that you can listen to with Bluetooth or with a cord if you feel so inclined. The sound quality is really good. I had some concerns when I got the box. The picture with the remote was for scale of the size of the box. Once I took out the headphones out and unfolded them, I was excited to find that they fit over my ears comfortably. For the price, you can't go wrong!",1
5.0,Great Product so we got another set!,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"My husband got these as a gift and liked them so well that I got a set too.  It is so cool that we can use them to listen to the television, especially if one of us wants to listen while the other person is reading, for example.  I like the way they also will connect to my I phone so that I can talk and listen while running around the house doing other things, or cooking.  I would recommend them.  They are a nice product.  If you use them for you television, you may need to get an extra piece for the tv. though.  When our son gave them to my husband he actually had purchased the extra piece of  equipment for the tv.  I could pair mine with it as well.",0
4.0,Started producing static sound after 4 months (updated),"February 12, 2018",Yes,"I've had them for 5 months. They worked fine to begin with - the sound was okay as long as you aren't an audiophile. One downside is that you can't use the microphone over bluetooth - you need the device to be plugged in to your PC. The build quality is nice - and they are comfortable...However, about 4 months in these things turned into garbage. The sound is really staticy now. It sounds like I am listening to AM Radio in a tin can...UPDATE: Seller/manufacturer contacted me over email and sent me a new set that I am happy with atm. It could be that the previous set I had was a bad set. I'll update this if I have another bad experience. If they continue working at shipped quality - I'd rate the product at 4 stars.",0
3.0,won't stop emailing me (poorly thought out features for otherwise good product,"July 5, 2018",Yes,"I thought the headphones were a pretty good product with a couple of unnecessary features that detracted. With mixed feelings, I left a three star review which sums of my thoughts as ""it's okay."" Based on a mediocre review, the company sent me a different model headset which I do not want and have not even opened. What a waste...They have sent me several emails trying to get me to change my rating. It is all very annoying. I just wanted a low-cost bluetooth pair of headphones. I do not want to begin a relationship with company...ORIGINAL REVIEW.Good quality build and sound in an inexpensive headphone. Comfortable. Flashing blue light is no good and there is no way to turn it off. I got these to use on the crowded commuter train and the flashing light is right in other people's faces. The voice feed back about pairing/turning off, etc. is also irritating. Simple beeps are much better.",0
3.0,Overall good but no bass,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"Battery life seems good, used for several days on one charge, still plenty of battery left..Extremely comfortable ( still need to take them off every couple hours to let the ears breathe and relax, but very comfortable while they're on)..Power controls could use some improvement - have to hold power button for about 5 seconds to turn off..Sound quality pretty good overall, except that bass is practically non-existent (in spite of what product description says).  This is main reason I am returning them. I'm willing to pay a little bit more for better bass.  Were it not for this I would probably keep them.",0
5.0,A perfect pair of inexpensive headphones.,"October 30, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are truly awesome!  I have bought and thrown away 4 pairs of headphones in the past 6 months. Each time, I have been looking for a relatively inexpensive pair that work reasonably well.  If it wasn't  sound issues, it was the marginal fit to my head that ended up making me look for something else. I was beginning to think that I needed to spend the big bucks, but even that wasn't a guarantee that I would like them.  These Mpow headphones completely changed my opinion about getting something worthwhile without breaking the bank.  Within hours of receiving them, I have fallen in love with them.  They fit perfectly and are very comfortable.  The Bluetooth paired up perfectly with my PC and phone. The controls are easy to use while I am wearing them and the sound is way above average.  One of the best features was the ability to wear them anywhere around the house without losing Bluetooth connectivity.  At this point, I will gladly say these are the best value for the price out there.  Of course, should anything change, I will update this review but as of right now...These are perfect!",0
1.0,Will not work correctly after 4 months,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"Really disappointed with this brand. Read through reviews of multiple headphones before buying. But these were okay for the first few months. Now they are just worthless! They do not stay locked in place and slide off my ears completely. The Bluetooth connection is always pausing or interrupted which doesn’t allow for any song or show to play without interruptions, beeps, high pitched tones coming through. I didn’t want to have to spend more money buying another headphone set but will be buying a different brand 100%.",0
5.0,A great value and worked very well,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"First of all, these headphone are stylish and ""expensive"" looking. They fold nicely and come with a small gray bag with drawstring. Included is a plug for your device as well as a plug to recharge if using wireless. I purchased these to use on a plane. I still heard humming when in use, but I had to take them off to hear the pilot and attendants when they spoke. Their voices were very faint when wearing the headphones. I watched a movie on my Kindle and the sound was loud and clear. They fit well and didn't hurt my head in any way...I recommend these headphones. A great value and they work great.",0
5.0,Highly Recommend these- Excellent Quality,"August 28, 2017",Yes,My boyfriend and I have a small apartment so we often have to have the conversation of who needs to turn down the tv for the other to rest in the bedroom. I initially was looking at buying nose headphones but after reading the reviews I decided- what the hell. I'll give these a shot- they can't all be fake reviews! So I bought them and it's been awesome!.These are perfect for watching tv (we hook up our laptop to the tv and connect the headphones to the laptop) and for only $36 you can't beat the deal! I honestly feel like this is a steal for how amazing they are. You have to charge them out of the box but otherwise they sync up perfectly- I love these! Recommend! I got all black.,1
3.0,Limited Range,"July 21, 2017",Yes,"I've had $100 headphones and decided to go cheaper this time.  The others had a range of 150 feet and worked well through the walls of my house.  This one has a solid range of 20 feet and a spotty range of 40.  The sound is good, but don't forget to make sure that it tells you 'Power Off' or the headphones will be on and drain the battery.  Good deal for the price.",2
5.0,Super comfortable- glasses friendly - great sound.,"February 18, 2018",Yes,"Update: the company sent me their new model and man oh man did they listen!! These work with my glasses perfectly ! The new material is comfortable and breathable - it does not crush my head, and I can wear them for hours at a time. This is night and day difference and I highly recommend you give these a shot - if you didn’t like the old version the new one fixes all the previous problems .  I truly appreciate the customer Care, and that they made changes to make these a fantastic headset..Old review for comparison:.It will crush your head..It is super tight - Returned it almost immediately..NOT GLASSES FRIENDLY",0
3.0,Fine for the price,"April 3, 2018",Yes,"For wireless headphones, the sound quality is decent, but not great. The volume buttons are fairly annoying, with a loud “ca-chunk” sound with each press that reverberates right in your ear, and the power on/off voice is loud and unnecessary. A simple and unobtrusive audio cue would suffice. They’re relatively comfortable, and the padding feels great, keeping it snug on your head. I have a large head, and while I don’t need need to adjust the extenders all the way, it does feel a bit tight, sometimes pressing against the spot below my ear/above my jaw that triggers my gag reflex. But maybe I just gotta weird head. I’ve also encountered some audio stuttering when pairing it with my TV (that’s less than 10 feet from my couch) that I don’t experience with my Beats X earbuds, but turning it off and on seems to fix it. When working properly, I still notice white noise that is irksome...In the end, these are fine sound dampening headphones for the price, but I’m left unsatisfied...Edit: I was sent out another model for free, without contacting the company. It's a different model, which isn't an over ear style, but it was an extremely nice gesture. I prefer the new model, so really nice customer service.",0
5.0,A Senior Citizen Who Enjoys Listening At A Nice Price,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"I'm very happy with this headphone and fantastic price compared to the very pricey brand names.  Sure the audio quality is probably better, but my 68 year old ears are doing quite nicely listening to my variety of music and play lists.  I take exception to the few people who had difficully fidgeting with the controls.  Pretty standard for all the models that I'ved used or seen.  Now back to my private listening pleasure...I've niw been listening to my music collection through the headphone for over two weeks and I'm sticking with 5 stars.  The clarity/fidelity of these headphones is wonderful.  Good bass, treble and stereo separation is fantastic.  Again, for the great price over very expensive brand names, you can't go wrong if you're watching your wallet.  :-)",0
5.0,Highly Recommend!,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are very sleek, stylish, and comfortable! It can connect to my phone via Bluetooth, and it has a high battery life. It comes with a cable in case you can't listen to something wireless, and it comes with a charging cable and a velvet bag for transport. The sound is great, the cushion is comfortable, and my ears don't hurt after wearing them for a while.  They are also very easy to use.  I highly recommend this product.",1
5.0,Fits great for eyeglasse wearers!,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"I ordered these headphones specifically to listen to my audiobooks. I wear glasses and these headphones fit very comfortably on me,without the usual pressure of over the ear headphones. I was impressed by the sound and quality of them because they were inexpensive. I also like the fact that they are foldable! For anyone that likes the color Pink,these are very nice shade of Pink!",1
3.0,Okay for Price,"May 10, 2018",Yes,"While these are on the cheap end of bluetooth headphones, I am still a bit disappointed.  They do work, but they make obnoxious beeping sound effects that can be heard by anyone around you whenever you turn them on, and they announce ""phone 1 connected,"" out loud as well when connecting. When your headphones get on low battery, it makes an irritating sharp beeping noise every minute or so as well. When listening to anything there is a constant soft static noise. It isn't easy to notice when you are listening to something loud and continuous, but during quiet parts or when nothing is playing, you will probably notice this. Finally, for some reason when I try to play Fortnite on my computer, these headphones do not work for the multiplayer mode, while my normal apple headphones work just fine. Overall these aren't terrible, they just have some pretty basic issues that make them irritating to use at times.",0
4.0,"They quit working, BUT they made it right","July 25, 2018",Yes,"Update 8/15/18: After I left the below review I was contacted by their customer support to let me know that they saw my review, they apologized for the defective product, and that they already shipped out a replacement at no charge to me. I was very impressed by that, especially since it was about two months after I bought it. They are working good so far, hopefully these last longer, and if so I will update the rating to a full 5 stars. As of now I updated it to 4 stars for their customer service response alone...Original review: The product 'was' working great. Bought for my eldest nephew's birthday in May. Now they have completely stopped working. He didn't damage them, they just stopped. They only lasted 2 months, but now the window is closed for returns. Extremely disappointed.",1
4.0,Not compatible with hearing aids,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"This headphone set was overall a very nice quality, comfortable and decent sound. My circumstances and requirements are different as I wear behind the ear hearing aids. I have tried several brands and would've preferred to save money but this set makes my aids feedback every time so I had to return. The more expensive brand is not causing this. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars as it didn't work for me.",2
5.0,I love these headphones,"April 9, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. I can't wear earbuds and need a set of full headphones. I'm not super picky and my cheap pair of $5 ones I had previously worked ok, but they were wired and the ear piece sat squarely on my cartilage piercing, which would get very sore after a short time. These headphones completely cover my ears, which means no discomfort for my ear piercings. They also delivery very good sound quality and the Bluetooth distance covers the majority of the size of my gym and home. They worked great for travel as well. It was nice to be able to put my phone up and continue to listen to my music. Definitely a great product for the money you spend!",0
5.0,Updated pair sent - Great customer service,"February 15, 2018",Yes,"Bought these for my Dad to replace a pair of high end noise canceling Panasonic headphones, and although he said he likes the sound quality of these, he says that after a short period of wear time, they are also uncomfortable. I tried them on and have to agree. Probably wouldn't be so bad if the ear cups had a larger diameter but because they don't, they pinch the outer rim of your ears. Ouch! 3 stars for sound quality and functionality...Update - The vendor, Patozon, is a great Amazon seller. They sent me sn updated pair of Mpow headphones and they have a better fit! Great customer service.Thank you Patozon.",0
4.0,He was happy with the performance,"April 15, 2018",Yes,"It's a shame. Got these for my son who is coming of an age where he is exploring his own musical taste. He was happy with the performance. I was happy with the price. HOWEVER, The first time we plugged them in to charge them the house filled with the smell of burning plastic.  Smoke was coming from the headphones! The area around charging connection on headphones partially melted. Connector of charging wire also partially melted..UPDATE: Decided to give them one more try after Amazon refund. Second pair is working well. No problems with this one. All manufacturers have a defective product once in a while.",0
5.0,Amazing bang for buck quality,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"I am very impressed by the sheer bang-for-buck provided by Mpow on these headphones. These bluetooth headphones are comfortable with their memory foam padding and free-roaming earcups, easy to store with their ability fold inwards to increase compactness, relatively easy to pair to your device, and have an excellent battery life. I can't speak for their durability given that I've only had them for little over a week now. Their sound quality is decent given the budget price. One complaint I do have is sound leakage. Being played at a relatively average volume level, they will leak sound a tad bit. It's not much of a problem for say, a gym where there is constant background noise but in quiet scenarios it becomes a bit annoying as you broadcast what you're listening to others. I'd dock them half a star for this if I could, but all in all, I am very impressed. These may be the best budget bluetooth over-ear headphones on the market.",1
5.0,Great item great value,"May 1, 2018",Yes,What a deal I wanted to purchase the bose or beats but did not want to spend $300 got these for my trip to Asia and they are the best noise canceling headphones. What makes them even better is that they are wireless and were extremely affordable. I was leary about how good they could be for the price but they really are amazing and come in some great colors. I can’t say enough good things about these headphones.,1
5.0,Excellent for the price and perfect for an office setting.,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable for long wearing periods, including with glasses. Easy to pair both with phone and laptop. No active noise cancellation, but a good enough fit that when music is playing I'm not distracted by low nearby noise. Charge lasts forever, and you can listen while charging if necessary. Nice audio quality and has its own volume levels separate from that of the audio source (headset volume control does not, for instance, change laptop output volume). Corded audio backup also available if necessary. Nice storage / protection bag included, as well as the charging and audio cable. I didn't test the microphone but for office listening, which is what I bought them for, this is a great headset for the price.",0
5.0,Very good product,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"Great Bluetooth headphones. Very easy to use and the sound quality is as good as the more expensive brands and these are a quarter of the price. I workout frequently and was looking for a good Bluetooth headset to get rid of cords that get in your way and I tried these and have been very happy. Bluetooth headphones tend to be expensive if you want decent sound quality, but these are the exception. They are obviously much bulkier than ear buds, but that doesn’t bother me. Quality for the price is tough to beat.",0
5.0,Great Bluetooth Headphones,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"These Headphones are awesome! For the price of 40 dollars,  they are one of the best headphones you can get. So far the battery is doing well, and I sure hope they have an amazing battery life..I really find the aux cable port so useful that if your headphones are dead you can still listen to music. The base is great and has great passive noise cancelation. Though the headphones are a bit big but they can fit on people of all head sizes. Overall these are great headphones that can't be beat at this price.",0
5.0,"Can't beat these for the price, stop looking and buy them now","December 13, 2017",Yes,"I'm listening to them as I'm typing this if that tells you anything. For the price you can't beat these. They're comfortable, so far have held up very well. No trouble with connection. There is some ambient sound when they're on and you aren't playing any music/sound however that goes away when something starts. Sound is great and the ear over covers do a great job keeping noise out. They've been a life saver in a cubical environment to zone out and get stuff done.",1
4.0,Huuuge cans!,"February 1, 2018",Yes,"This is a huge set of cans! You gotta have a lot of confidence in order to rock these amongst all the clones at the gym wearing their Beats headphones. I don't know what kind of Dumbo ears other reviewers complaining about the fit are dealing with but they fit over my lobes perfectly! They sound great. Although it took me a bit of time to find the correct EQ setting as they have quite a bit more bass than what I was used to with just a set of earbuds. I only have a couple of small design issues with them:..First, I wish the button controls had raised symbols on them so they could be located with my fingers better. Nothing sucks worse than going to turn up the volume on your favorite song only to accidentally hit the song advance button instead...Second, they have the tendency to get a bit sweaty after a while, especially when working out. Adding some airflow through them would be nice but I don't know if this can be accomplished without compromising sound quality or noise dampening.",0
5.0,You can't find a nicer $40 pair,"July 16, 2018",Yes,"Even despite the price, these are a really nice headset. Allows 2 items to sync, though I haven't tested to see if both could play at once. Battery has lasted for about +8 hours or more on a regular basis. The sound quality seems a touch muffled or maybe the bass isn't there, but otherwise no complaints at all. You would be hard pressed to find a better $40 pair.",1
2.0,Power on time is disappointing,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"I bought it because I like the pink and from the review it seems like a pretty good buy for the value.  After a few weeks now, there started to be noises interfering whatever you're listening to like you dial a wrong radio frequency.  I don't know if it's because I didn't do a full charge of 4 hours.  I think 4 hours is a RIDICULOUSLY long time to have to charge ANY electronics you use often.  I can't imagine if the charging time of my phone is 4 hours how disruptive my life would be like...I'm gonna give it a full all night charge tonight to see if the noise still goes on on bluetooth mode.",0
3.0,The sound is pretty darn good and they are quite comfy as well,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for travel (I'm on a plane 3 times a week) and I needed something on the ear/over the ear as buds wont fit my ear canal anymore. I wanted something affordable but still a decent quality. The sound is pretty darn good and they are quite comfy as well, though my head begins to hurt on the top at about hr 3 of wearing. My only issue thus far is that the volume cannot be at max when not up in the air. I am partially deaf so I tend to listen to my music much louder than the avg person I guess and even with my source at half volume people sitting next to me can hear the music. If my source is at max volume, which is where I prefer it, people 10ft away can sing along with me.",0
5.0,Perfect headphones can handle ultra low volume all the way to booming loud. Soft and comfy for the ears.,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"I am happy to say it has been one of the best headphones i have ever used. I like 3 main features. 1 its super soft on the ears, some headphones foam section is so small your ears constantly hurt after an extended music session. 2. If you want to be discreet with your music or movies, or videos after midnight for example you can lower multiple times and have very good audio still. If the standard headphone let you lower the volume 5 times, this headphone lets you bring it down 12 times without lowering the volume on your iphone. 3. Its loud , when your working out or in public and people are loud you can block them out no issues.",0
2.0,Left channel died after four months,"October 25, 2017",Yes,"Product arrived Jun 29, 2017. It is now Oct 25, 2017. The left side no longer has sound when connected physically or over Bluetooth. The ""Power On"" (and other) audible announcements are similarly only coming from the right side. For headphones to die after slightly less than four months of listening to music and podcasts at my desk is unacceptable...Update: Patozon sent me a replacement pair of headphones. This was a nice gesture, but I'm really not interested, as I have already bought a different product to replace these. I gave them an additional star for the effort. Good customer support; bad product.",2
3.0,Off button is difficult,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"The sound is great and my boys love the fit.  The problem is that the OFF button does not work very easily.  More than once they have pushed the multi-function button to try and turn them off and it tries to pair the headphones again.  I thought it was just the way they were doing it, but even when I try I have the same problem.  Basically, there are too many functions on the main control button.",1
4.0,Great Headphones! But check if your phone is 4 port (TRRS) or 3 port (TRS),"February 6, 2018",Yes,"These headphones were exactly what I was looking for while commuting to work and blocking out the noise of my coworkers while at the office. Initially I was having difficulty with the device due to my phone (LG G6) having a 4 port TRRS jack. These headphones come with a 3 port TRS jack. I purchased a new cable and was able to use the headphones as others have. I have a large head and these headphones fit me at the 2nd to last setting!..Pros:.Long Battery Life, Comfortable, Almost complete noise cancelling, Stylish, Variety of color options...Cons:.Customer Service never got back to me regarding the port issues, I needed a 4 port cable for my phone, Microphone is does not perform well in spaces with any amount of noise.",0
5.0,These headphones are perfect for travel!,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"Love these headphones! Bought them for a month long trip abroad and they never let me down! The wireless Bluetooth feature is a life saver, and the side has a play/pause/skip feature that worked seamlessly as well. Holds a charge for a super long time, I actually never had it die on me, I just plugged it in every few days. I bought the Mpow case for these and really liked that as well. Definitely an upgrade from crappy wired ear buds. Worth every penny!",1
5.0,Work great and very easy to pair,"April 4, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphone.  They are exactly as described. No issues with packaging.  I saw some comment about issue with pairing but I have had no issues connecting them to my laptop and my phone.  There is a small instructional book in the box that tell you how to connect them and the headphones actually tell you when they are pairing.  If I have them connected to my phone and want to connect them to my laptop, I turn the bluetooth off on my phone and then turn it on on my laptop and they pair without issue!  There is also a carry bag that comes with them that I use to take them to and from work where I use them for webinars because they help cancel out back noise in the office while I am involved in the webinar.  One of those items you cannot live without once you have them!!",0
2.0,"I wasn't expecting Beats quality, but I expected something.","January 18, 2018",Yes,"For almost $40, i was expecting a lot more than what these deliver. The blue tooth signal is very weak, and the sound is a weird tinny, muffled sound. Even when plugged in. Volume wise. With my PC volume all the way up, these produce about half the volume of what others are capable of..I've had wireless headsets of half the cost that were better than these..I'll probably give them to one of my kids. I have no use for them.",1
4.0,Really nice!,"December 11, 2017",Yes,"I am not the user, my husband is and he really likes these. Sound is great and the buttons are easy to use. It even talks to you!.A much needed upgrade from a pair that I won in a work contest (The headband snapped after a few months). These are sturdy and well designed...Only downfall is that he needs to pair them each time. He only uses them for listening to the TV when I go to bed so I can't speak to any other functions.",1
5.0,"A little work on setup, but works like a dream.","August 6, 2017",Yes,"I love it! It was a little challenging pairing the headphones with my phone, but I haven't worked with bluetooth much. I got the hang of it after a few minutes, and from now on, if I want to use the wireless function, I can simply tap the bluetooth icon on my phone...On quality, I'm not a big audiophile, but these headphones are pretty good. I sometimes like to watch ASMR videos with these and the sounds are so clear. The bluetooth signal cuts out when you're too far away from the source as expected, but it's way better than being tied down by a 3ft cord...It's a very sturdy build. I'm hoping that they last long because my normal earbuds only last a few months. Make sure to buy a usb bluetooth adapter for computers and laptops because it only works for phones and tablets without it. Overall, these headphones are a dream and I'm satisfied with my purchase.",2
5.0,Very Nice Headphones,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"I use these primarily for when I watch tv. I connect them directly to the audio output via a cable.  I have connected them to other devices and they connected with bluetooth easily. These are well-made inexpensive headphones.  The lows are a bit too accentuated for my taste, not booming but just a tad too heavy. The included audio cable is flimsy but it does work. That's not a dealbreaker as I can purchase a new cable when I have to. I'd certainly recommend them.",1
1.0,Bulky and the music cuts out,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"Not only did my ears get super warm wearing these for a short period of time, but the music would cut out once every couple of minutes. It was like the bluetooth had to reconnect. The same thing happened on my iPhone, Mac, and work PC. I sent them back and got a pair of wireless sports earbuds that work so much better.",1
3.0,"Solid sound for $35, but deal-breaking loud robot lady every time I turn on/off","February 22, 2018",Yes,"For $35 these are OK, but I won't buy them again...The sound is solid, but I hate them because of this ridiculously loud robot woman voice that speaks every time you turn the power on or off. And to turn off, you have to hold for a few seconds, and it has to pass through pairing mode (loudly announcing ""PAIRING"")...every time you turn it off! So basically I can't use it late at night because it's so loud it'll wake up my wife and/or kid. From the other reviews and questions here, there is no way to disable it...This is really deal-breakingly obnoxious. I'm going to use it at work where it's hopefully loud enough no one will notice my robot lady friend, and if everyone notices I'm going to return it.",0
5.0,"Great sound, even greater value.","November 6, 2017",Yes,"I have a fairly large head and I have tried several brands of headphones. After about 30-45 minutes on other sets, my ears start to hurt because of pressure on them. With these headphones I can listen for about 2 hours before the same thing happens, so that was a huge plus for me. For the low price the sound just a good as my friends Beats audio or my sons Bose. Really shows how much people are paying for an image. Also. I don't know if you can do this with other headphones but you can use these to talk on your phone.",1
5.0,"Great fit, build quality, but basic sound. 5 star customer service!","August 26, 2018",Yes,"I bought these based off the good reviews. My Noontec Zoro HD  wireless headphones stopped working so I figured I would try these. Sound quality is no where near the level of the Noontecs. Bass and clarity are nonexistent imo. Fit and build quality are pretty good, but that is all...Update: I have changed ny rating due to the custoner service being beyond excellent. Apparently the company of these headphones do read these reviews. They saw that I was not happy with sound quality and sent the H2 model which meets my satisfaction.",0
4.0,Pretty good,"November 26, 2017",Yes,"It works well for what it is. It plays the music within the BT limitations. Sound is okay, nothing spectacular. I'm 6 foot and it covers my ears comfortably blocking out most but not all external sounds. Since it covers the ears it eliminates the wind noise I get with ear buds and keeps the ears from getting chilled.",2
5.0,good value and work as advertised.,"January 15, 2018",Yes,Had them about 3 months now and they stick work great for the price. They are not studio headphones by a long shot but they do work well corded or Bluetooth. Great  for watching videos or listening to music. My ears start to sweat and itch after about an hour and a half but every headphone I have ever owned did that so I can't hold that against them. They do a pretty good job as muffs too. I have to wear them off of one ear to be able to hear conversations in the room.,1
5.0,"Excellent price for what you get, excellent customer service!","June 19, 2017",Yes,"My first pair had issues with the bluetooth, where it would connect but play no sound. The headphones worked excellent with the aux cord, but it couldn't play audio remotely. Contacted support and returned it with a 70% refund of the shipping cost. 4 days later, I now have a new pair that work excellent! The sound is much more crisp and I'm glad I stuck with it..It's definitely a very snug fit on my large head, but it's much more comfortable as you extend the ear pieces. The bass is excellent, and sound quality overall has given my old Sennheiser HD 429 headphones some competition. These win due to being cordless, and less than half the price!.And if you aren't on the move, you can plug in an aux cord for pristine connection quality.",2
5.0,Seriously Hands Down Best Over The Ear Bluetooth Headphones for the $$$,"September 19, 2018",Yes,"I do not know where to begin because these are as good as the reviews have said, maybe even better!.Battery Life -  Phenominol.Looks - Touch Jet Black.Sound - Crisp, Clear and Loud.Fit - Ultra comfortable.Quality - Top Notch for the price point.Hands-Free Calling - Does the job.Convenient - They fold up and fit nicely in the soft grey carrying pouch.Connectivity - Quick and reliable, have no issues connecting to notebook, iPhone, TV, MP3 and stereo..6 Stars if I could give them!!!",0
5.0,Best ive ever owned!,"July 22, 2018",Yes,Amazing. I love these as these are the best headphones i have ever had. They last 3 days for me and charge in like 2 hours. I took these to a 5 day trip to a hatsune miku concert in texas and they lasted the 6 hour plane rides and the waiting in the lines and the hours of boredom in the hotel i was staying at. These are perfect for anything and can take a beating. They sound amazing too. The only issue i have is that the top plastic part broke but thats only because i over bent them. And also these are wayyyy comfy too! I sleep with these on every night with no issue and wear them all the time and i can even leave my phone downstairs and run upstairs real quick with no loss of connection!,0
5.0,Great Quality for the Price,"July 18, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these Bluetooth headphones to wear to the gym as I do not like earbuds and didn't want a wire hanging about while I worked out that might become tangled.  The headphones are perfect for my use:  they stay on well even when I'm running, have a nice Bluetooth range (50 - 75 ft) so I can leave my phone in my car, and the sound quality is good enough for me.  I really wouldn't change a thing about them and would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a nice set that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",1
4.0,These are great. They pair with my phone easily,"April 6, 2018",Yes,These are great. They pair with my phone easily. Last all day and don't hurt my head or ears when I wear them for long periods of time...They convert to regular headphones with a 3.5mm cable if you have a device that does not connect via Bluetooth so they are very versatile...The sounds quality is good and volume level is great...The only reason I give them 4 and not 5 stars is because they are huge. They have to be to fit over the ears and be noise cancelling (which they are ok but not great at) but they don't have a small form factor. I had a different pair of Bluetooth headphones that we're much smaller but honestly these are fantastic so I highly recommend them.,0
3.0,Good Headphones at a Great Price,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"With over the ear headphones closing in at well over $100.00, you have to ask yourself; Am I buy these headphones because of the name brand? Sure, the sound quality of the name brands may be a little better, but really not by that much. These are comfortable pair of headphone for listening to music while lifting weights at the gym or watching a movie or your iPad. You can have 2 devices hooked up to it. So if you are watching a movie on the tablet you can switch over to your phone with a push of a button. The button is where I have 2 problems with; it seems to be low quality &amp; it does most things. The one button pauses, answers phone, dials phone, turns on, pairs and turns off. I have dialed a number in the middle of my workout when I just wanted to pause. If you hold the button down to turn off, it will say pairing then power off. And with the button feeling “cheap”, I wonder how long it will last. I know that we believe less buttons are bettter, but I would prefer the dial or outside line to be a different button.",0
5.0,Low price but high quality,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"I go through tons of headsets, due to the nature of my work, and I think it's because the integrity of the wires is compromised over time.  I figured it was time to upgrade since I recently purchased a new computer, and for the price, I don't think the quality could be beat.  I was not expecting at this price point to get the quality that I did with this headset. I am actually thinking of purchasing three or four more as standby headsets, and at this price, I can do that.",1
5.0,Fantastic quality at a fraction of the cost of “big name brand” Bluetooth headphones.,"July 11, 2018",Yes,"Unbeatable at this price point. I have owned a handful of different types of Bluetooth headphones over the last few years. These headphones are just as good as a pair I paid $179 for two years ago. My only complaint would be the blue light that blinks while the headphones are paired and being used. I listen to podcasts at night to help me fall asleep, and my wife was annoyed by the blue beacon of light that was blinking in her direction at bedtime. I covered the light with a couple pieces of duct tape, problem solved. Would highly recommend",0
5.0,Used the Headphones for Just a Short While,"October 13, 2017",Yes,"Bought these headphones to use on noisy aircraft and they work extremely well. Had no trouble connecting the Bluetooth to both my tablet and my cellphone. I haven't used the cord to connect directly to the aircraft seat connection, so I can't give an opinion. After looking and listening to some very expensive headphones (Bose, Sony), I cannot tell the difference in the sound. Also, since they are very new, I cannot answer how they stand up to use over any amount of time. They seem, so far, to be well worth the money.",1
5.0,My mom liked them so much that I bought her a pair ...,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"I actually got the green pair for myself when I work out. My mom liked them so much that I bought her a pair of the red ones! We love them. The sound quality is amazing and they have the noise canceling. It’s true you can’t hear anything else besides the music. Especially in a noisy gym. Very happy with this product. Made well too. They mentioned about the headset not fitting well or feeling snug. To me they fit just fine, sometimes they feel a little like they want to fall off but that’s only when I do certain moves. It’s not a big thing at all.",1
4.0,These headphones work really well and have great sound quality,"June 5, 2018",Yes,"These headphones work really well and have great sound quality. Love that my phone/ipad/computer can all be connected at the same time and holds its charge for a long time. The only issues I have is that it is a little bulky around my head and turning it on and off is a little annoying as you have to hold the middle button down, I wish there was a separate button I could use to just turn them on and off.",1
5.0,"Good Quality, Good Sound...","March 2, 2018",Yes,"Love these headphones! Wanted bluetooth headphones that didn't cost a fortune but still had a good sound. I decided to give these a try because of the ratings and the price. These are everything I hoped they would be. Well made, great sound and easy to use. Pairing with my iPhone was quick and painless and because of the way the button's are set up, they are very easy to use and I'm glad they had the blue ones since that is my favorite color. One big plus is being able to use these if the batteries die. In a nutshell, if you want a good set of bluetooth headphones that won't break the bank, these are for you!",0
2.0,Great in concept but not in execution,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"I loved this at first --- comfortable, really solid fit, not much outside noise filtered in. But in the past month I've become increasingly annoyed by them. Sound is disrupted by what sounds like unstable blue tooth signal --- not on the part of my computer or iPhone. It's the headphones. Friends told me the microphone sounds like I'm underwater or in a cave --- although I didn't expect a great microphone so it's not a dealbreaker...But the crackly sound quality, missing parts of words on videos, etc. is annoying enough that I tried to return them. But my window for return just ended. I like them in concept but not execution. I'll buy a higher quality set next time.",0
4.0,Excellent headphones for the price,"January 6, 2018",Yes,"Excellent headphones for the price, however it's a bit misleading that when you are searching through categories, these come up as compatible with gaming systems. Does NOT work with PS4. Trying to find out what dongle I have to order to make it work with the system, which is an inconvenience...**UPDATE** Customer service went above and beyond by responding (unprompted) and sending a dongle to make it work with the PS4. While the dongle they sent still makes things very awkward (it dangles off the controller), it does work. Regardless of that, the level of customer service was outstanding, so I'm upping my rating by a star.",0
5.0,Great purchase!,"August 4, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones! They really cancel out any noise concerns I have. I’ve used them for calls, and they work great. The battery life is phenomenal compared to another cordless, Bluetooth pair I have now. I admit I went by the reviews and still almost purchased one of the similar looking pair of these that cost a lot more. I’m so happy with my choice. My husband uses them to mow the yard and loves them. I couldn’t have made a better choice. These are fantastic! They are just as good, if not better, than the big box names. Get a pair now!",0
5.0,Put to the ultimate test!,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"I've been using them for over a month now no the connection is great! I've moved room to room and even into the bathroom enclosed in tile and still got decent connection. Very impressive. Sound quality is great for the price, not heavy with bass if you're looking for that. I also wanted to make sure I could plug these headphones in and not solely rely on Bluetooth so that's a great side note for these too. I workout in these too and yes I am sweater &amp; that hasn't destroyed them along with doing my homework for hours in them at the library. My only is that wish they were noise canceling and that they came with a hard case because they aren't the sturdiest headphones I've gotten but definitely worth every penny I paid for it.",0
2.0,"Terrible talking interface and distracting light, good audio, physical design.","July 28, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are comfortable and I haven't had any connectivity problems whatsoever.  So that's good.  I've had these for 2 months now and they drive me insane.  The first 50 times of turning it on and hearing  ""power on, phone 1 connected"" and then turning them off and hearing ""pairing ... your headset is disconnected ... power off"" were ok.  After two months now though I'm having buyers remorse.  Having some combination of quick beeps where the number of beeps indicate something you might have to look up would be much better.  The headphones say all this stuff, but after 50 times it becomes much more like nagging.  The blue light on the actual headphones also pulses about every 5 seconds.  This isn't bad unless you're in a room with a mirror that can reflect that light every 5 seconds (like most peoples bedrooms).  Do you really want that as you watch netflix in your bedroom at night?  The physical design and audio of this product are great.  The talking interface and incessant pulsing of the blue light are such big drawbacks that despite the physical design, audio, and the fact that I haven't had any tech difficulties I have to give it 2 stars.  If you plan to use these for more than 2 month I would recommend a different brand that doesn't waste your time with constant nagging and dumb lights that someone thought would look cool but are really just a distraction to anything you do at night.",1
5.0,Great headphones.  Definitely worth the money.,"January 15, 2018",Yes,"I bought these several months ago, to replace my aging Sony BT headphones.  As others have mentioned, when using the microphone, people will have a hard time hearing you, so I mainly just use them for sound.  Battery life is great.  I work a 12 hour shift, and these easily make it through my full work day on a single charge.  I also work in an area that has around 75 decibels of ambient noise, and these greatly reduce (not entirely) that outside noise.  They are very comfortable.  I wear them nearly continuously during my 12 hour shift and sometimes forget I'm wearing them.  I enjoy them so much that I bought a Bluetooth adaptor for my PC, and they now serve as my gaming headphones as well.  I will likely get a second pair soon, one for work and one for home.  My Sony headphones were on hear, not over, and whenever I bent over they would fall off my head.  These remain firmly in place.",1
5.0,Updated review,"December 12, 2017",Yes,"UPDATE: So after I posted this review, I was contacted by their customer service. They sent me another pair of headphones (the MPOW H2) and they are awesome. I transcribe a lot for work so i wear headphones for 5+ hours a day. The H2 fits great, I can wear them for much longer than before, and i like that the H2 had all the same features such as the option to be wireless or not, the easy to use buttons on the ear phone and the padding on the head band. The H2 are ""on ear"" and not ""over ear"", so theres no noise cancellation, but they do a great job of still playing music loud enough to quiet the world around me. The sound quality seems to be the same but the H2 had an option to change the EQ, which I really like. I was not expecting to be sent a whole new pair of headphones and I really appreciate the time and effort the company took to make sure I was satisfied. Thank You!..These are awesome headphones but they are soooo tight on my head. I can't wear them for more than a few minutes before getting a headache. I'm hoping they will stretch out a little bit after some use, but if they don't, I'll have to return them.",1
4.0,About the fitted ear cushions,"April 11, 2018",Yes,"I haven't seen the design of the ear cushions discussed in other reviews, so I thought I would describe them here.  When I first tried wearing these headphones, I just placed the ear cushions flat on my ears, and the cushions felt too small.  However, when I examined the cushions more closely, I noticed that the inside of the cushions did not go straight down to the speaker surface.  Instead, they curved inwards, so that there was more space near the bottom of the cushion than at the top.  So, instead of putting the headphones flat on my ears, I tried placing them halfway behind my ears, and then sliding them forward into place over my ears.  This allowed my ears to slide into the larger space at the bottom of the cushions, with the cushions cupping my ears rather than sitting on top of them.  This felt much better, and my ears had sufficient space.  I should note that the adjustment of the headband spacing is quite sensitive, and I had to tweak it repeatedly to find a spacing that didn't feel like my ears were being pulled up, nor having the weight of the headphones resting on the top of my ears instead of the top of my head.  Once I found the correct spacing, though, the headphones were very comfortable, with the only remaining issue being that my ears grew noticeably (but not uncomfortably) warm after an hour or so of wear.",0
4.0,Good customer service.,"July 22, 2017",Yes,"EDIT: Customer service reached out to me, and shipped me a free replacement at no cost due to the faulty piece. Thank you Patozon for your help and understanding on this matter!..I'm a little upset by these headphones. The sound quality is pretty good, but the headset itself seems to be made relatively cheap. I've had them for just over a month, and the power button just fell off. Completely unprovoked. I went to turn the headphones on and off it came. I really liked these, I have actually recommended them to a few people. I don't think I can do that anymore after experiencing this product defect. I would love to get the set replaced, but oh well. I wanted to like them.",1
4.0,Huge Headphones,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"Okay so these are my 1st pair of bluetooth headphones, so keep that in mind. But I do love them. They hold a long charge (I use them for 90 mins at a time every day and have never experienced no power if I charge every other week). I love the freedom of bluetooth, the comfort of the padding on these. 2 things- they could maybe get a wee louder but they are still burst your eardrum loud. They are huge. I mean, if I were to use these jumping around or leaning forward much they'll fall off my head. I didn't measure or anything but my head isn't freakishly small. They work for now though.",0
5.0,Awesome Headphones!,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"Love my headphones to the moon and back! They are so comfortable on my ears with a great sound quality and a long battery life just flawless! I listen to a lot of music at home and at the gym or just about anywhere and I own a lot of brapnded headphones but this one takes the cake for the ease ,functionality and also for its stylish looks In fun bright colors! Planning on getting them in more colors just for a standby and for later use or maybe even for a gift! Super cute! Five stars and more!",0
5.0,Incredible value for the price.  So good I bought another pair!,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"Loved them so much I bought another pair for my kid.  Build quality is solid.  Sound quality is much better than I expected.  Folding is a great feature as they even fit in my jacket pocket.  Noise blocking of ear muffs is outstanding for non-noise cancelling headphones.  I'm trying hard to find anything bad to say about these.  I guess my only wish is they had ticks on the control buttons so they are easier to find and use, but it's not that bad.  I plan to superglue a little plastic dot to each button for easier identification.  For the price (I see one color is down to $34!) I don't think you'll do better than these.",0
5.0,Great headphones for the price,"September 22, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for my daughter. We went on vacation last month and I wanted something cheap that I wouldn't mind her tearing up. She didn't use them (she's only 2 but always plays with mine) My mom ended up using them on the flights. They are great quality headphones. Threw them in my backpack. I love having the ability to use aux cord and still listen to anything without battery power. Sound is great. Never had an issue. I did not use them for bluetooth listening, though.",1
3.0,"Good fitting headphones, Poor functionality","August 3, 2017",Yes,"Good quality headphones. They feel solid and the metal hinges make the headphones more durable. The oval ear muffs fit my ears nicely and do not pinch my ears like round ones. The sound quality is good and cancel a good amount of noise. Bluetooth was easy to setup and connection is quick every time I turn it on. The headphones come with a nice much and good quality cables. The one downside is that the headphones can only connect to one device at a time, even when using the audio cable. When the audio cable is connected, bluetooth is disabled. The other downside is that it is hard to tell which buttons you're pressing. The buttons need something to identify which button you're pressing. I had to put little stickers on the volume buttons.",0
5.0,I couldn't believe how great these sound,"February 20, 2018",Yes,"I couldn't believe how great these sound. I was so skeptical. Buy my $250 Harmon Kardon SoHo wireless headphones dies, and I'm not in the mood to pay out the nose for a replacement. The HK SoHo's went bad after one year and then my second pair went after two years. These seem just as good! These must be made for Mpow by a larger company, that knows how to produce quality sound. These cranked up just a loud as did my HK Soho's. and the battery is great on this one. The headphones are comfortable for at least 3-4 hours of wearing for me in the studio. BUY THEM! An excellent value for what you get.",0
5.0,AMAZING,"September 19, 2017",Yes,"Holy heck, these are great headphones! I honestly can't say I was expecting much due to the price, but these are fantastic! I wanted wireless headphones, but definitely didn't want to spend hundreds on the Beats. These have great sound, were easy to pair, and are compact for travel. With iPhone no longer having headphone jacks, these are perfect. They also come with a headphone jack cord if you want to use it, but the battery life is so great it's not even really necessary. However, it is nice that they included it. Don't hesitate with these, they are awesome!",1
5.0,Loving My Headphones,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I took a chance on spending a little more for a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones back in April. I wanted to listen to the music on my cellphone. l have not been disappointed. The battery lasts forever and the sound quality is great. Recently l was very pleased to discover l could use these headphones with the Bluetooth Tao Tronics Transmitter and Receiver Wireless Audio Adapter we purchased 6 weeks ago for our bedroom TV. They are adjustable, lightweight, easy to use, and so comfortable that l fall asleep wearing them.  They don't fall off my ears like my earbuds would always do, which was very annoying. These are the headphones you want to buy.",0
4.0,I find them incredibly more comfortable than in-ear buds,"December 12, 2017",Yes,"These have been surprisingly solid over the past few months. I find them incredibly more comfortable than in-ear buds, and I also tend to think they offer somewhat better sound quality. The battery life has yet to let me down. Yes, the construction is a little flimsy, but what do you expect for $40?..The hard-wire feature was an unexpected bonus and has saved me a few times when I ran out of batteries or wanted to listen to a movie on the plane.",1
4.0,Update: Amazing customer service!,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"Great build quality, good fit and comfortable, but come on! High end is muted, mid range is mushy and sounds distorted. Bass is ok. My $40 JBL in ear buds with tiny little drivers are way better.  Will be returning these...UPDATE.Contacted by customer service after return. They sent me, at no charge, a pair of the M2 version. The sound is much better to my ear, not stellar, but performing at a much clearer level than the original pair...All I can say is""Wow!'. Truly fantastic customer service and very good performance from the headphones. Thank you MPOW!",0
2.0,Not Noise Cancelling,"September 21, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these because they said are like the other Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are not and that was my only reason for buying them. I get more noise cancelling out of my earbuds.  But they are comfy, a little large for my head, but not a biggie and don't know how long the battery life is since I only used them in the living room w/ Alexa playing music and my Kindle Fire playing music to see if I could only hear MY music and not Alexa. I heard Both! Not the happiest purchase I've made so far.",0
2.0,Second try - Good customer service,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"***UPDATE*** After my initial review, the sellers sent me a replacement without my asking.  Good practice.  I've been too sick to take care of a whole bunch of little practicalities in my life, but once I give it another go, I'll revise my upgrade if it can last until March 1st without undergoing the same problem.  In the meantime, I have raised my score to two stars, above the original one...Looked great.  Worked great for a short while.  Became increasingly fussy.  Stopped working in about a month.  Collects dust.  Not a good option.",2
4.0,Heads up,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"Decent product. Turn off and on is a little tricky. Sound quality is decent. Not  Particularly impressed with its  Comfort level when wearing it for a few hours. Seems to me it needs to be padded better. Over all a decent  Product,  but is not comfortable for wearing For a long time period.  Better than wearing ear phones in my opinion. Earphones constantly  Fall out of my ears. I do like the fact that I could walk to my kitchen and listen to something on my cell phone Without having the cell phone with me. Will re evaluate in a month or so.",0
5.0,Comfortable and Affordable!,"June 8, 2018",Yes,"I haven't had these long, but I already love them! The ear cups have a 4-way swivel, which makes them super comfortable and fitted feeling. It also helps block out noise, so even though they aren't noise cancelling, they definitely quiet my commute on the train every day, without having to crank up the volume. The controls buttons on the side are intuitive, and folding up is a nice feature. The battery life seems pretty good - I use them for an hour twice a day on my commute, plus 1-2 hours at home every few days for TV/movies - and the low battery noise isn't obnoxious (it's a low boop-boop and fades your music slightly every minute or so, as opposed to my old other brand, which muted my music for a loud BEEP-BEEP-BEEP every 20 seconds). Finally, the price is really good for bluetooth over ear. This style used to always cost an arm and a leg, and I'm glad the price is catching up with demand for wireless.",0
5.0,Pretty and great quality,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"I bought the black and blue headphones, my favorite colors. I have been using these for a few months now. I do transcription and video captioning work and use these for hours at a time for at least a few days before having to charge them. The sound is great, the buttons have easy access, you can also plug them into the computer like regular headphones if the battery is dying so you can keep working. I have no complaints at all. They are exactly what I needed for my work and super comfortable to wear.",0
5.0,I was a little skeptical,"December 6, 2017",Yes,"I came across these and I was a little skeptical. I decided to purchase the headphones based on the great amount of good reviews. I am happy I did, and I am sure that you would be too. I am no audiophile, but I've been listening to music for a long time and from many different sources. And trust me, this sound really good! Add in the fact that they cost a fraction of the price you pay for other name brand headphones, and it is hard to beat. The Bluetooth functionality could improve, but it works well enough to still get a five stars rating overall",1
4.0,Decent sound quality,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these have pretty decent sound quality. I am also very impressed with the battery life.  I listened to music for three days at work and didn't need to charge them in that time...Only criticism so far is that the padding on the headband could be a bit softer.  After long periods of wear the top of my head started to feel soar.  The ear padding was just fine though...I also wish it had a power switch instead of holding the middle button to turn it off and on.  Sometimes when I try to shut it off it first goes into pairing mode before finally turning off since both actions are performed via holding down the same button.",0
5.0,Head phones are awesome. I had bought all of my teenages one ...,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"Head phones are awesome.  I had bought all of my teenages one for last Christmas.....they all have iphones.  I never demo, but all of my teens were very happy with them! Score one for Dad...usually never can have all happy teens at the same time.  My antiquated plug in headphones which I use when mowing disappear.  I was tired of being tethered to my phone with a wire while mowing....not very safe.  I remembered that I had ordered wireless headphones for my kids from amazon and looked it up under past purchases and ordered ola pair.  Wow, huge difference in sound! While I am not sure if these are noise canceling or not....all I know is i did not need to turn the volume up much to hear my music over the mower.  When I am not mowing and need to use the phone, the microphone works well indoors or out.  Very clear!!! The headphones are well built and comes with a little bag for storage.  The only complaint I have is the instructions type is extremely small.  I have readers glasses and needed to break out the magnifier glass.  Other the that...I am happy with the purchase.",0
5.0,"Lasted 6 months, now in the trash! Update: Supplier will resolve damaged headset","February 1, 2018",Yes,"They are nice to look at. When I walk with them on there is this funny stepping sound I hear from my feet because of the fit on my ears. Its weird and distracting but eventually I looked past it. Sound is good enough, pretty light. I often forgot to charge them but I used the aux cord and was fine for the mean time. I've had them about 6 months and the right side has gone out, so for about six months they did what I needed them to do, now in the trash they go...Update: After reviewing this product not even complaining to the actual supplier the supplier heard me and within what must have been a day or two after my review, I received a brand new headset in the mail. I had no idea they were coming. I really appreciate the supplier listening and taking action. Your customer service goes a long way and now I know if I purchase from you and if something goes wrong to reach out and you will do your best to resolve the situation. Thank you!",0
5.0,"Great Look, Very Comfortable, Exceptional Sound Quality, Flawless Bluetooth Connection, Long-lasting Battery","February 27, 2018",Yes,"First of all, this pair of headphones looks fantastic. As a person who loves to wear fashionably on every-day basis, it's a great fashion choice with any casual fashion. Especially, I love those red strips on the head band and on the edges of the headphones..Secondly, the headphones are very comfortable to ""wear"" for a long time because of its great cushions on the parts that contacts the ears and the head. My ears are usually too large for ear cups of most headphones, so usually, it's really difficult for me to wear and use headphones for a long time as most of them apply a lot of pressure on my ears and hurt my ears after hours of use. However, the headphones have very large ear cups that completely cover over my ears fully without applying any pressure on either of my ears, allowing me to use the headphones without any pain on my ears. The bonus part is the extra soft cushion the headband part of the headphones, as this also reduces a lot of stress on my head. I have a pretty large and sensitive head, so any stress or pressure applied to my head for long time causes headache. But the headphones never caused a headache even after nearly a whole day of wearing it on my head..Third, the headphone Bluetooth connectivity is really great and cross-connects and transfers nearly flawlessly (I say nearly, since there are times I have to restart the headphones to connect both to my phone and my laptop, but usually connects automatically without restart). Also, I've seen that the headphones play music without any disturbance on its Bluetooth signal even when I am pretty far away from the device that I have connected the headphones to (by pretty far, I mean approximately 30 feet to 40 feet). I think the maximum distance that it connects to is like 50 feet (at the maximum, the signal starts to distort). The buttons are very responsive, and the microphone works pretty well (all over Bluetooth), too..Fourth, the sound quality of the headphones was exceptional for this price! I was surprised that the headphones gave a good bass while giving very clear crisp sound without any distortion (usually, if there is some emphasis on the bass, the high crisp sound gets little bit of distortion). And those qualities usually come with high-end headphones that would cost at least 100 bucks. So, when I got the headphones and started listening to my playlist with lots of different genre, I was really happy that I got the headphones..Finally, the battery power of this headphones is incredibly good. The headphones lasted on batteries for the entire day when I just charge it for may be two hours. I pretty much have this headphone on me all the time as long as I am awake, and it never gave me that low battery warning throughout the day. After a long day, I plug the headphones to the charger right before I go to bed, and when I wake up to go to school, the battery is fresh and goes on for another day. Moreover, if the battery ever does run out, you have that extra 3.5mm aux cable to use the headphones just like other normal wired headphones. If you use that cable, you can use the headphones without using its batteries. However, I never use this cable since the battery of this headphones seem to last pretty much forever. And what's the point of having Bluetooth headphones if you use it wired?.So yeah, that was my first extensive Amazon review and I give thumbs-up if you are deciding to buy this product..I know it's long but that's because I really like the headphones and would like to recommend it to anyone who are looking for good Bluetooth headsets.",0
5.0,Great for exercising,"March 5, 2018",Yes,"Actually fit ""over"" my ears, not pressing on them. Mainly got these for exercising, and they've been great. Easily adjusted to stay on my head comfortably, and hold my glasses on, while doing core work, burpees, pushups, whatever.!!! Good sound quality, volume and bass. Love the battery life. The first recharge was after a full month of use. That provided an average of 30 min/day, 5days/week for exercising, and I can't even guess how many hours listening to books. Controls, pairing and anything else I can think of, were easy. Gives verbal queues. To power off, continue holding the power button until ""power off"" is heard. 6-8 seconds maybe. Would happily buy again or recommend.",0
3.0,Cute but cheap feeling.,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"My niece asked for some headphones for the holidays. Seeing as I would not be purchasing a 13 year old a pair of Beats, I thought these gave the same sleek appearance. They look the same in person as they do in the picture, however they just feel a bit cheap. Definitely Not sound cancelling. She liked them but hasn't really used them much because of the bulkyness. They did come with a carrying bag (cheap pleather). They are OK.",1
3.0,Mine don't work well.,"February 13, 2018",Yes,"As blue tooth it basically useless but as wired it works every time. Extremely comfortable but sound is lacking. Worked maybe two days wireless then stopped but decided they are to comfortable and for average movies the sound isn't that bad so I'm forgetting the wireless part and will use them as wired headphones. For Music I switch to my Koss Pro4AA, yes they are heavy and three hours is tops.",1
5.0,Great headphones at an affordable price,"September 20, 2018",Yes,I am actually surprised by the sound quality of these headphones. I mainly use them through Bluetooth but when I use the aux the quality is amazing. I know the sound quality is better through cable than Bluetooth but the sound quality you get from these is usually not found at this price range. The battery also lasts a really long time.,1
4.0,"It's great, but buy if on sale $26 or less.","March 1, 2018",Yes,"My workouts at the YMCA have passed me by now that I can listen to my playlist better than when I had earbuds.  The headphones hold the connection well, and it's a little pressed on you all around, meaning you can do your workouts with no worry of them sliding around or falling off, something I wasn't sure I'd expect from $25 headphones.  I'll give it a pass on some troubles with producing a good, clear bass since most of my songs don't have much, and it's good for the price I got them at.  My only issue is that connecting to it has a huge flaw.  I have to play something for about 15 seconds after it says it connected before it actually starts playing.  Meaning I connect it, and play it for that time, before going into the building, or have people listen to what I should be listening to for a short bit.  That I don't like, and it makes me feel like a dick for bothering others with my phone on max volume playing ""Sexy B****"" while working out.",0
4.0,Not that Great to Pretty Good,"January 6, 2018",Yes,"Wouldn't connect to Bluetooth and when connected to the cord, there was an annoying static noise to anything I listened to. Sent it back...Update:.The company sent me a replacement, which I tried out for a few weeks. This time around, my experience was a lot better! My devices connected well, the sound is great and loud (when I need it to be), and all of the buttons function. They're pretty good with keeping noise out but aren't noise cancelling, which is perfect for me. My only complaint is that the mic isn't as good as I'd like for calls, but overall I really like these headphones this time around.",0
5.0,Great product,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"My husband had always been a BOSE user but when his current headphones were on their last leg I decided to get him a replacement set. After reading a multitude of poor reviews outlining the nosedive in quality on the BOSE products, I decided to give these a go. My husband LOVES them had no idea how affordable they were, he assumed they were on par with the several hundred dollar price tag of the competitor. He uses them all the time and the product has been holding strong two months in. Good purchase overall.",0
3.0,Warning: plug in usb cable = no audio,"April 4, 2018",Yes,"Call me crazy, but sometimes I like to use headphones to listen to music on my laptop while charging ithem plugged into the laptop..These headphones will not work neither with Bluetooth nor the usb charging cable that comes with it, while charging..That's like having a phone you can only make calls on once it's unplugged from the charger!.The only way to use it while plugged in is with the 3.5 mm cable which means, you guessed it, its not charging..No Bueno if you ask me. You should be able to listen through the usb cable too.  Or at least, allow it to pair while charging.",0
5.0,"They work!  Hurrah!  I love the green color, and the quality is great!","August 15, 2018",Yes,"These were actually a surprise--sad, but true!  The connected easily with my Chromebook, and they sounded great!  They were really great because I could use them with my older notebook as well, with the provided plug.  They are comfortable.  That is sooo important to me--I had another pair that were smaller and they smashed my ears--OUCH!  These are comfy on my ears, and the sound and quality is great.  I bought them for that , but I ended up going on a trip, and they folded up nicely, and came with a nice carrying pouch, so that was a real perk!",0
5.0,👌👌,"July 25, 2017",Yes,"I have used this headphone for awhile now and I really love it. It fits around my ears and glasses, maybe not completely perfect but the sound is amazing. I compared it to my older Skull candy headphones and these ones are definitely better. I enjoy wearing these while chilling at home or talking a walk..Like all headphones you'll have to take them off after long uses because it may hurt the top of your head/ears, but I usually wear these for longer and I've been fine.",10
5.0,Comfortable headphones and the product I received matches all of ...,"July 23, 2017",Yes,Comfortable headphones and the product I received matches all of the specifications listed. Pretty good quality for the price and everything feels real sturdy. There's a slight electronic hum when you're paired via Bluetooth but it's not noticeable when you actually start playing audio...I'm using it mostly for listening to music while I work around the house. Still haven't tested the full range cause I'm in the habit of carrying my phone around with wired headphones. Had a surprise phone call and despite not having read that section of the manual the interface was pretty intuitive and self explanatory. The caller didn't make any comments about me being muffled or hard to hear or too loud so I'd say that function worked well!..This was my first set of Bluetooth headphones so I don't know how they compare to other brands but I'd consider this a good 1st pair to see if you like this option.,1
4.0,Good Headphones,"August 13, 2018",Yes,"I rate these headphones at 4.5 stars...The sound quality, the comfort and the ease of use of these headphones are all exceptional for the money (&lt; $40 at the time of this review.) They sound good both wired and wireless...I've dinged these headphones half a star because of the requirement to unpair the headphones from your device before turning them off. This is due to a flaw in the headphones' software—to turn off the headphones, you press the power button for four seconds. But to unpair the headphones you press the same button for 2.5 seconds. Meaning you always unpair the headphones before turning them off...There is, however, a way around this—plug the headphones in, while still on, to recharge the battery. This immediately and automatically turns the headphones off without unpairing them. One shouldn't have to do this, but considering price to performance,  it's a small quibble for an otherwise good set of headphones. I recommend them.",0
5.0,you will not find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones,"July 19, 2017",Yes,"I have to say that I didn't think much of the headphones at first but after having them for only a week I knew I had to buy another pair. Now don't get me wrong they aren't anywhere close to Beats headphones but for the price, you will not find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones. I bought a pair for work and another for home and so far so good, I don't have any complaints. I have recommended this product to EVERYONE in my office and since then I've seen at least 4 co-workers with the very same pair!",1
5.0,Very good for TV but not hifi,"October 24, 2017",Yes,"Wow, I was expecting the average so-so fit, but these fit my large head very well, and are comfortable wearing for extended periods.  While the sound is nowhere near studio quality, with the overall sound seemingly 'flat' across the frequencies, it works perfectly for me watching the big screen.  I can hear sounds at low levels with these, that I can only hear at much higher volumes with a high-end sound bar.  The only criticism I have is the gyration you have to go through to pair these with the transmitter (used matching product for that even) and for turning it on and off.  You have to read the instructions for that...not logical, but it works!",0
2.0,... finally found a pair of bluetooth headphones that are comfortable and with excellent sound,"December 22, 2017",Yes,"I finally found a pair of bluetooth headphones that are comfortable and with excellent sound...Update: after using them for just over a month, I am disappointed that I have to return them.  The on/off button doesn't work properly all the time. It sometimes takes a number of tries to press the button just right to turn it on/off.  Sometimes the button gets stuck.  I think the fact that there are three functions on the button and you have to press it in just the right place to get each of the functions is the cause of the problem.  When I am trying to turn it off, it sometimes dials the last phone call I made.  I love the fit and the sound but I cannot deal with having to struggle every time I want to turn them on or off.  So - I am returning them and will look for another pair that has a different type of on/off button.",1
4.0,Solid value for money,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"Lets start with the pros:.-Excellent range.-Holds a charge (charged last week and its still going, over half the battery still left.).-Sound quality is in line with my wifes way more expensive wireless headphones..-Price..Cons:.-Sometimes cuts out but, oddly, only when phone is in my pocket? Works fine when i walk to the otherside of my apartment or leave the room. Still working that one out.-Little bulky; i was hoping they were a bit more streamlined...I like these headphones a lot. They are not your high end model but are perfect for my commute and hooking into my smart TV. If you want some quality, for a much more reasonable price, these would be my pick. For what I paid, I am very happy.",0
4.0,Pretty good but a Funky volume button,"June 19, 2017",Yes,"Sound is good and they are prerty comfy on my big head. I do have to take them off so my ears can ""breathe"" for about a min once an hour. The battery life is also good and the side controls sre very convenient, however the volume up button on my headphones only works about half the time. I will push and hold it and wait and the volume will not increase and I will have go push and hold it repeatedly sometime before it will begin to work. All in all they are good Bluetooth headphones for the price.",1
5.0,"Great sound, comfortable, battery lasts quite a while, very pleased.","December 10, 2017",Yes,"Was a little skeptical on these, as I usually can't find any over the ear headphones that don't give me a headache after 30 min use.  I gotta say though, i've worn these for hours at a time, no issues. Range is very good for bluetooth, sound is very good as well.  I bought these after trying the Mpow bluetooth in ear headset, which i really liked.  I think you'll be happy with these, unless you a serious audiophile.",1

Will definitely shop with them again...***Update***.Looks like I may have a defective headset. The company was response was quick, &amp; apparently...a new pair has been sent to me. #highHopes..It’s baffling how a pair of headphones, this size, have 0 bass response.

4.0,My Unusual Case,"August 3, 2018",Yes,"I work in a call center where I may listen to music/streaming shows on one ear with my other ear on a headphone to handle message traffic.  I HATE BUDS -- they make my ears sore and fall out too often.  I wanted a nice set of comfy headphones for my entertainment.  Unfortunately, when using only one of the MPOW earphones, the other one does not seat well on my head so that my work headphone pad fits on the other ear.  Who would have foreseen this?  Anyway, the MPOW's have great sound when I'm on my treadmill or puttering about the house.  Others I have demonstrated the MPOWs to are impressed and so am I.  I did comparative shopping and sustain the high ratings the MPOW set deserves.  Thank you",0
5.0,Great headphones.,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"I've had these for a couple of months and they work just fine. Just remember that when it says ""power on"", let up on the button, otherwise it will connect/disconnect in an instant; you have to get the timing just right. I learned after a dozen tries. Has a short learning curve if you have any patience at all. I work online and use it constantly but only have to recharge it about every 4 days or so. Remember to turn it off at the end of the day. The sound of your voice through the microphone is a bit echoey, as there is no mic boom. Nobody complains and so I just guess it's expected.",0
5.0,Best for the price. I may buy another one.,"August 30, 2017",Yes,"Just love it. One of my best purchase from Amazon. Sound quality is awesome. I don't own Bose, but compared against it at work. This is a big savings for similar quality..Product is designed pretty well. It looks better than the pictures..I owned few &lt;$100 headsets, and never felt the same with any others. They were ok for the money, but this is just great!..Bluetooth sound quality was poor initially, but after a settings change in windows, it is awesome now.",1
4.0,"Good things, they are soft","June 7, 2018",Yes,"Updated Review..So I did a review a little while ago, it wasn’t particularly a great one. Well the sellers got a hold of me and sent me new headphones. I didn’t want to do a review right away so I could see if the same problems I had before were still there. I haven’t had any of the problems that I had before. Great customer service...————————————..I waited a little bit before giving this review because I wanted to test it out and see if it was worth it...Good things, they are soft, comfortable, work great on my computer and cell phone. Charge does last quite awhile. Hasn’t died on me yet in between charges, I have gone a couple weeks between charges, and I use them a couple hours a day...Bad things, it lags when connected to my tv. I have to unconnected and reconnect occasionally to get the voices and lips to match back up..I also can’t use it for calls, the mic doesn’t work and I can’t hear the other person. I don’t use it much for calls since that doesn’t work, so I try not to worry about it...Was it worth the money? I say it’s a 50/50 for me.",0
4.0,Good buy!,"July 31, 2017",Yes,"Looks good and sounds good.  I am by no means a headphone expert.  It was really easy to pair with my phone.  I also like that there is a voice to tell you power on, power off, device paired, and maximum volume.  Some other headphone just beep different number of times and expect you to know what the beep means...One bad thing is that it cuts off right where my earring studs are and so it presses the earring rod into my face/neck so it is uncomfortable after a few minutes.",1
3.0,"Great sound insulation, convenient, versatile, comfortable.","February 26, 2018",Yes,"Really really great headphones. Good audio quality though I'm not an audiophile, and amazing insulation from sound. Not sound cancelling, but well insulated. All I hear is my music unless people raise their voices, and even with the headphones off of my head, you can barely hear any sound bleed. Battery life is great, and the option of bluetooth or corded is amazing. Volume and song skip buttons are convenient and easy to use, and the collapsible storage is compact. Look great too...A few months into using, battery no longer charges. Still works perfectly when plugged in, but no wireless/bluetooth option anymore. Still good headphones, but nonetheless I'm disappointed.",0
4.0,"They work.  Theyre woth the money, but a bit bulky.","December 6, 2017",Yes,"These are definitely good for the money, hands down.  I feel like they are a little too big and bulky to go running outside with though.  They kinda slide down when I'm jumping rope, and bench pressing.  The sound is good and synching them to my phone was simple.  My wife calls them my Voltron headphones because of the size.  I like them, they're worth the money, but I don't think I'd leave the house with; A little to bulky.",1
4.0,these are great headphones. They connect super easy every time and ...,"April 9, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are great headphones. They connect super easy every time and the battery lasts incredibly long. I've had them over a week now using them every day for working out and I still haven't needed to charge them...That being said, these are music headphones. They are very, very bass heavy and without downloading a third party app on my phone, there was no way to adjust how they sounded. I find the voices in songs are muffled and pushed to the back, and it's even worse when using them to watch tv shows. I wouldn't recommend these for people who listen to a wide variety of music, they seem most suited for dance or electronic. I had wanted these to be my all the time headphones, but it looks like I'll just be using them for music as it's impossible to get them to sound good for streaming shows...Still, they do what they say and it's a great price for bluetooth.",0
3.0,"Packers Beware. Also, don't play with Bluetooth settings too much. Otherwise, the headphones work quite well.","June 23, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have served me well for a long time..First off, most of the time, once I've connected to my computers one time, I don't need to reconnect again. The only times I've had to do that was when I fiddled with the Bluetooth settings myself too much. Just leave the headphones to connect by itself..I've never used any of the buttons on the side except for volume and power and it works well..I like how I can switch from wireless to wired very easily. At those times when I feel too lazy to plug the wire in, I can just use the wireless mode. When I'm not confident about the battery life, it's not a hassle at all to plug in. Just make sure that whatever micro-USB cable is long enough if you want to charge the headphones while in wired mode like I do..Some issues I've had: I've never trusted the mic. I thought I could add a detachable mic through the AUX jack, but that doesn't seem the case. A bigger problem is the construction. After several months of packing my headphones into my backpack, I'm now starting to get cracks on my headset (see the image). I'm not too critical about this since I just want headphones that have good audio and wired+wireless capability, but for those who will pack these headphones often, get an additional headphone case with these.",0
5.0,Worked Great for me!,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"Worked Great, I watched the review on them and that helped me decide.  The ease of use was great.  I used this with the Tao Tronics Wireless Portable Bluetooth Trasmitter to watch TV or a Game while my wife is sleep.  Great for keeping the peace!  Also, I like the way the headphones tell you when they are connected/disconnected.  They also tell you when they are powering off which is good so you don't leave them on inadvertently.  I tried the phone function once, but I really wanted them for watching TV",1
4.0,Big enough to work with piercings and soft enough to work with glasses!,"July 3, 2017",Yes,"I had a decent pair of on-ear Bluetooth phones that I bought at the big blue electronics store, and realized too late to return that they irritated the piercings in my ear cartilage to an intolerable degree. I gave those to a friend and took a chance on these for myself...These cost about half as much as my prior pair so I was a little skeptical, but the sound quality is just as good if not better. The circumaural cups are perfectly sized for me, but I think they wouldn't be for someone with large and/or protruding ears. For me, though, I find that the foam is thick and squishy enough to avoid contact with my piercings and also mold comfortably around my eyeglasses without significant sound leakage...My only significant gripes are with the on-board controls. The play/pause/power button seems to be kind of finicky on the timing (sometimes I hold it down for a while expecting to turn the phones on or off and nothing happens). Also, it's not very easy for me to feel the up/down forward/back controls since they're all on just one continuous ring. I think having a raised symbol or even just a little nub on each of those 4 spots would make it a lot easier to control...Bottom line, though, I'm very satisfied with these, especially for the price.",1
3.0,Not compatible with PS4,"December 13, 2017",Yes,This headset has a good sound but is not compatible with ps4. I had to order a seperate dongle to connect to ps4 bluetooth.,5
5.0,Well worth the price.,"June 30, 2017",Yes,"Amazing. I can honestly say that this item is well worth the money. I have bought headphones 10 times the cost and the quality on The Mpow equals and in some cases exceeds the sound quality. I love this headphones, this are the only ones I use for the gym, relaxation and trips. Keep up the good work guys 5 stars all across the board for me.",3
4.0,UPDATE,"December 9, 2017",Yes,"UPDATE: While I did have issues with the first product I ordered, the sellers were VERY PROMPT in their efforts to correct the situation. They stayed in contact, and actually replaced the item. As I said, I am a big fan of these headphones. This is still true despite my unfortunate first experience..  I want you all to understand that I was so excited about these headphones when I got them. The reviews were definitaly in favor of them. The first time I wore them I did notice that the sound was not quite working in one side of the headphones but then that quickly cleared up. It was kind of bouncing back and forth between the two sides. I also was not able to answer the phone hands-free I had to actually take the headphones off to be able to answer a phone call. Sometimes it did work though. The really bad part of this is that one day I had the headphones plugged up, and when I came back to get them, about 30 minutes later, I smelled an electrical...smokey kind of smell. When I went to pick up my headphones they were HOT and the area where you operate the headohones had MELTED! This was pretty scary! Thank God it didn't start a fire! I did reach out to the company, and they asked if I had use a fast charger or something  with the headphones,  which I had not. This happened with proper use. These would have otherwise gotten a better review, had they not try to off me 😔",5
5.0,microphone and headset,"November 23, 2018",Yes,I noticed that the microphone works very well for when i receive calls.  The headset is a little bigger than another set i have but these are superior even at a cheaper price.  Very tempted to buy the iJoy model to see how they work but these are very nice.  I am not a huge fan of over the ear head sets as you can only wear them for a short period but I am happy with my purchase.,1
5.0,Better than Beats,"March 4, 2018",Yes,"Awesome, just awesome.  Spent 200 on a pair of beats before that I dropped and they broke, unrepairable.  I wasn't going to buy those again, so I found these.  These are great for the price, comfortable, the buttons are responsive, they sound surprisingly good, and the best part is the bluetooth pairing.  They pair to my iphone within 2 seconds of turning them on everytime, i always struggled to get my beats to pair.  Terrible.  These don't do a very good job with voice calls, but I haven't found a pair of bluetooth headphones that I like a voice call on.  Battery life is AMAZING.",0
5.0,Comfortable and Loud Enough,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"I like to listed to music or podcasts while I mow the lawn. I also like to wear ear protection to muffle the sound of the mower engine. These headphones do both jobs well. I am not sure of the actual db protection from the sound of the mower, but they seem similar to the ear protection (shooting headphones) I wore before. The volume gets sufficiently loud so I can hear over the sound of the mower. And, they are comfortable. I've only used them one weekend, but I am happy so far. And the price was reasonable.",0
2.0,Underwhelming,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"With as many positive reviews these things have, I was expecting a half-way decent set of headphones, even at the price point.  To me, the most important factor is the sound quality in reviewing these, and that's where they completely fell flat.  Mids and Uppers were decent, but the Lows weren't even there.  My music sounded completely flat with these.  Honestly, I've had quite a few pairs of $10-$20 earbuds that outperform these by quite a bit.  I've returned these to Amazon to purchase another set from another manufacturer to see how they will perform and compare.",0
2.0,"RETURN HASSEL - Huge, cheaply made product","March 9, 2018",Yes,"BYER BEWARE. You WILL BE CHARGED FOR SHIPPING FOR RETURNS. Not satisfied with product. It is much too large for the average head, and the foam is too soft and cheaply made-VERY likely to rip or puncture. This is not your usual hassle free return item either. YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR SHIPPING*** Make sure you REALLY WANT this product before you purchase. I'll definitely be using amazon less thanks to this hassel. It is MUCH easier to shop for and return items at an actual physical store.",1
5.0,A well made quality product that you can own without breaking the bank,"September 5, 2018",Yes,Mpow 059 Bluetooth Headphones is a good quality product that is well worth the price. There are so many products that simply don't live up to their advertised hype. I purchased the headphones for my eight year old grandson and he  don't want to ever take them off. I can't recall the number of wired headphones that I've purchased for him in the past and they all lasted no longer than a week. But this product although not expensive appears to be a well made quality product. They fit my grandson very well and now I think that I will purchase one for myself. A great product that delivers as advertised and will not break the bank. Thanks.,1
5.0,Great headphones,"September 3, 2018",Yes,"I really like these headphones..I ordered the pink ones while they were on a flash sale..I don't use the bluetooth option a lot at the moment, but I've had no issues with it when I have used it..The sound quality is great in my opinion, my tech/quality fanatic boyfriend said they were pretty good for the price and what not..I wish I could make the head strap a tiny bit smaller, but it's not a big deal..Overall, I'm very pleased and would definitely recommend them.",0
3.0,never got to try em- UPDATED,"September 23, 2017",Yes,"Never got to try it. The one I received smelled funny and wasn't wrapped properly...UPDATE 11/15/17: The company generously sent me a new, properly packaged headset. I have used for about 20 or so hours. There are ok. They are a bit bass heavy in the sound- think beats. They have a great battery life. I would estimate 8 plus hours that used it and it still didnt need a charge- mileage may vary. Customer service was excellent in this instance.",1
4.0,"Pretty good, but there a few issues 1","August 2, 2017",Yes,"Pretty good, but there a few issues.1. The band is kind of small for me so the fit is pinchy.2. The voice notifications when turning on, syncing and shutting off are annoying- would have preferred the information be conveyed with a little light that flashes or changes color. If I had to use this in an area where I had to be quiet I could see this being a problem..3. The design would have benefited from having a syncing button separate from the power button.",1
5.0,Fantastic headphones.,"August 14, 2018",Yes,"I am very dissapointed. Does not have enough volume or bass. I kept going back and forth deciding whether I wanted them. Reviews that said these are close to or like Beats Studio 3 clearly have never heard them. These also sound very muffled. Please tell me this company has a better over the head pair of headphones. I'd like blue. Nice build though. I like music to take me away with volume and bass...Update*****.Mpow sent me another headphone set, the Mpow H2.  I didn't realize I had them, my neighbor was holding them hostage as the post office left my package with them. Anyhow I just want to say that the Mpow H2's are absolutely wonderful.They can get very loud and has a  very nice bass. They also have a nice built onboard equalizer.  Anyone on the fence about these should get them. They're great. Will not disappoint.  Thanks Mpow.",0
5.0,"""Best Amazon purchase I've ever made"" - GF","July 5, 2018",Yes,"My partner bought these after seeing them on some clickbait Facebook article that probably said something like, ""37 of the most wicked awesome Amazon products with a cult-following!""..She needed new headphones, she saw these on that list. Boom! That was that...Fast-forward 10 months.....She says these headphones are hands down her best Amazon purchase to date. She's no audiophile by any means, but she loves the way they sound. And to price really makes them a great band for your buck.",0
5.0,SO FREAKING GOOD!,"April 10, 2018",Yes,"I love love love these headphones . . . . they hold a charge for freakin EVER and I get good loud sound with them.  Are they the best sound quality?  In my humble opinion, yes.  I've had Bose in ear headphones and I like these better.  The noise cancelling is better in these, sound quality is similar.  And for the price? Ridiculously good!  And bonus? The voice that tells you when headphones are on, off, and pairing is a pleasant british lady.  BUY THESE HEADPHONES if you're looking for a good pair of Bluetooth wireless headphones without breaking the bank.",0
4.0,I like everything about these headphones except the manner in which ...,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"I like everything about these headphones except the manner in which they turn off. You have to depress the power/pairing button 5 seconds, but sometimes that doesn't work and even when it does, it seems that I'm pressing much longer...The sound is quite good and I've only recharged them once in 2 weeks despite using them an hour every day. They are a bit on the heavy side, but I'm not bothered by that as I only use them on my daily walk...If it weren't for the power/pairing button not being particularly responsive, I'd give them 5 stars.",0
4.0,Best in class.....BUT....,"August 17, 2017",Yes,"......don't expect fast shipping unless you're a Prime member. Watched my order get taken and noticed,  then watched it take 7 days to pack and ship. Although it did arrive in 2 days (the last expected date)...On another note, don't expect HIGH volumes or HIGH bass if you're used to jamming tunes louder than most. However, do expect EXCELLENT quality and performance when you deal with a $40 investment compared to a $200 one. This is the first time I've ever bought over-the-ear headphones and couldn't be more impressed. Expect to get what you pay for, but don't expect a shattering experience. Expect a lot of quality and well deserved credit for an awesome (and cheaply priced) product...Fast charging..Great product..As described..Best buy...Find something better.....you won't.!!!",0
5.0,2nd pair were wireless but they let in too much ambient noise and the battery only lasted like 3-4 hours,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"My 3rd pair of headphones in the past year.  I just wanted something I could wear to bed and sleep to music instead of being woken up by noises, TVs etc.  First pair worked, but the wire kinda scared me, almost got strangled a few time.  2nd pair were wireless but they let in too much ambient noise and the battery only lasted like 3-4 hours.  This pair isn't noise cancelling, but covers the ear, very comfortable, good sounds, no wires, and the music is still playing after 8 hours.  That's everything I wanted for a very good price.",1

I wear and use these everyday and they never let me down.  It's weird how long the battery lasts.  I've never had it go dead and I just charge it occasionally.  It does say ""phone one connected"" or ""phone two connected"" even if it is a tablet or laptop which is kinda funny and makes you wonder why they didn't just make it say ""device one connected"" but whatever, it works great and that is all that matters.",0
3.0,Sound quality could be better,"June 22, 2018",Yes,"The sound quality could be better when using the headphones via Bluetooth. The sound clarity is more clear and louder when using the AUX cord. Also, the bass could be louder as some songs playback in a monotone pitch that would normally have more inflection..The battery does last a while and they stay paired when connected to a device. -- UPDATE: I received my replacement pair of headphones. I do enjoy the sound quality better with this pair, however, they are not an ""over the ear"" set of headphones which helps muffle background noise. They sit on top of the ear in an unusual way for my personal preference. With that being said, I am grateful for the replacement pair and your attempt to make my experience better.",1
5.0,I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"Okay, where to start.....They fit OVER my ears! They hang on for dear life at the gym and don't let go even when I'm laying back on the bench. They wait until my 60th jumping jack before they move even a little on my head. The sound it great. The bluetooth function is way better than most of the other head sets i've owned. They are so comfortable and soft! No irritation at all. I can sleep in these (if I lay on my back). The buttons work perfectly. They have a great range. Battery life is looooong lasting. They charge faster than my phone does. AND they are super cute. Love these!",0
4.0,Great quality for Chinese merch,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"Great quality for Chinese merch... Great sound, but bad bass.  My ears barely fit inside but once the music starts it's all I hear.  My ears tend to hurt wearing a beanie so I'll expect them to hurt wearing these.  Please fix the non bass issue and make them larger to fit comfortable around the ear.  For $35 I'm not complaining.  Usually Chinese products are garbage but this appears quality.  Very smooth fabric.  Only time will tell if it holds up in daily life and the gym.  If it begins to fail and fall apart like many Chinese products, I'll update according",0
5.0,"Easy Connect, Comfortable, Reliable, Great Price!","September 4, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for my 5 year old daughter to use during road trips and at home on occasions. The Bluetooth is very easy to connect, all you have to do is press and hold one button and the rest is done on its own. Press and hold down to turn on, press and hold down to connect, press and hold down to disconnect, press and hold down to turn off. It's easy as that. The voice in the Bluetooth system tells you what it is doing, so no trying to figure out what it just did. The material is very sturdy, yet soft and flexible. I also liked that it fit very comfortably on both my ears and my daughter's. After you charge it, the battery will last you about 2 days if you just use it in the evenings, like myself. If you're looking for something on the fair price range and have reliability at the same time, this is the Bluetooth headset for you.",1

They reliably pair with my iPhone and computer, and fit very well. My spouse teaches online, and has been using Bose noise-cancelling earphones, and I thought we'd try the Mpow 'phones, and we are very satisfied. These do not have noise-cancelling capability but have substantial sound baffling muffs, and for the price, we are very satisfied. They pair as easily as the Cheetas.",1
4.0,Good for the price,"March 17, 2018",Yes,"Okay headphones and does the job. Sound quality is average, but they are not expensive. I have hearing loss and it is hard to make out speech in the left ear for me. This is less the case with higher quality headsets. Charge lasts as stated. Earcup size is smaller than I would prefer and I have to take out my hearing aides to use them because they bump the setting on top of the aide. No noticeable lag with Bluetooth connection. Reasonably comfortable for multiple hours of use. I used them with a TV that is connected to a Bluetooth transmitter until I got something better (and far more expensive).",0
5.0,color me impressed,"May 26, 2018",Yes,"The Bluetooth range is incredible. I mean wow..The pairing process is pretty cool too. Just long press the power button to switch between paired devices...The Sound is good. They basically sound like loud airpods/apple earbuds. Which isn't a bad thing to me..Very comfortable ear cushions...Wish the Volume could be a bit louder while playing over Bluetooth, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯..For the price, god damn..Strongly Recommend for a starter pair of over ear head phones or a casual listener",1
1.0,Total Junk,"August 6, 2018",Yes,Headphone feels so cheap when you turn on volume up and down it make tap sound that everyone could hear. Mic didn’t work and call disconnects after 30 seconds. I also bought transmitter of same company. While watching YouTube and Netflix voice lag and break every 3-5 second. Customer service is horrible and keep going back and forth with stupid questions that I already have explained in detail. Total junk. Don’t waste you money and time. I thought itya high rated items. It should work fine but It didn’t work for me. Very disappointed.Edited 08/13/18.Customer service people are very unprofessional and don’t have any knowledge of this product. They don’t know how deal with customer issues. They sent me an email after going back and forth over 7-8 times and  said sorry we can’t do anything.,6
2.0,Great headphones all around. Read second update.,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"Good crisp sound, not noise cancelling, but they do a good job of blocking exterior noise. I ride public transportation in Chicago daily, so they are definitely tested. The range is good, never gives out no matter where my phone is, even when it's in my backpack. Not a ton of bass, but not bad either. Comfortable and good battery life, I use them daily and only plug them in to charge every other day and they have never died on me...::update::.The headphones have experienced their first true durability test. I went to put my hood on as I got off the bus and inadvertently knocked them off my head on to the hard cold concrete. I am six feet tall so it was a good drop, enough to scuff up the right earpiece and dislodge the plastic circle around the pairing button. I am happy to report that headphones still work perfectly and the plastic piece popped right back in. No damage at all other than the scuff mark. Excellent headphones...::2nd Update::.Unfortunately these headphones that I loved so much have let me down. After less than six months of daily usage, the left earpiece has given out. There was no triggering event, one minute the earpiece worked and then it did not. As stated before, these headphones did survive a fall a few weeks back. But no events since. The failure was completely random, review reduced to two stars due to poor longevity.",5
4.0,"Great for listening to music. Bad for communication (calls, discord, skype, etc)","July 4, 2018",Yes,"Hello to anyone looking to buy these headphones...PROS:.AUDIO QUALITY: First and foremost. The audio quality is fantastic. It is smooth, vibrant, and lively. You can add enchantments to it via your sound settings (if you're using a pc. I'm using windows 10). Such as Bass boost, Headphone virtualization, and loudness virtualization. Though these settings really don't fancy me so I leave it be. The audio volume is also very adjustable. With a press of a button on the headphones, you can configure the volume of your headphones. On my pc the volume is 50 it is fairly loud but not loud enough to burst one's eardrums. Having my comfortable volume at 50 allows me to configure it to equal degrees on whether I want it softer or louder. On the phone, Android, it appears the volume for the headphones is separate from the volume on the phone. As such if you increase the volume on your headphones it will get louder but it will not change the volume on the phone. Allowing you to slide the volume control to where to prefer...BATTERY: The battery on this thing is amazing. It will last you the whole day. A rough estimate of 14-16 hours with only a charge timer of four hours which may sound like a lot. But if you were to charge it before you were to go to sleep it will fully charge and allow you to use it until it's time for bed. An amazing part of this headphones is that you can use it whilst it is charging!!!..EASE OF USE: It is very easy to use. It comes with instructions on how to use it and its functions as well as details including what charger to use (I personally use an android charger, but I heard an iPhone charger is better or at least faster.). Simply press the center button until you hear it powering on and press it once more for it to start pairing. Once you pair it, it will pair automatically if you are using one device, but if you were to use multiple devices have no fret. It is very easy to disconnect, just simply hold the center button till you hear it disconnect and it will start pairing once more to which you can pair it to another device. Turning the headphones off works in a similar fashion but holding it a few seconds longer. Aside from its function of being able to use it while it charges it comes with cables that allow for a wired connection to your device removing the need to charge the headphones!!!..CONS: The microphone quality is rather sub-par. The mic for the headphones is rather distant. As I was chatting with friends over discord they described my voice as being two rooms away with a wall muffling my voice..___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________..Tl:dr - Great sound quality, Long battery life, short time to charge, and very good ease of use. Microphone is sub-par.",0
2.0,I really liked the travel bag it came with,"November 5, 2017",Yes,"The packaging and construction are impressive. I really liked the travel bag it came with, and the headphones appear well constructed. I especially like the material around the ear. Unfortunately sound is what matters, and that was extremely disappointing. The bass wasn't deep, and the highs weren't crisp. It was a very flat sound I would almost describe as muffled. Neither vocals nor instruments sounded good. The sound quality on the earbuds that came with my iPhone is far superior to the sound these produced. I've already printed the return label.",1

The ""buzz"" got louder when heavy notes/bass notes hit. The Bluetooth was noticeably quieter than when using aux. I ended up returning them...Update: After I returned them and left this 2 star review, they got in contact with me and gave me a different style of headphone for free (MPOW H2). This one works a lot better and I'm very pleased with it. The company has been good to work with and I enjoy my new headphones, but I still wanted to keep my review at 2 stars. Ultimately, the MPOW 059s were the ones that didn't work well and I didn't want to give an inflated review just because they gave me a different type that did work.",0
4.0,Impressive for the price,"October 5, 2018",Yes,"Just got these today, so far impressive.  Seem sturdy enough. Ear pieces are soft and fit completely over my ears easily.  I have a bigger head and these are snug but comfy.  Sound quality is good,  only a slight hiss at times, like others mentioned,  but nothing really distracting.  I bought them for work, since I work in a large, open office with about 50 other people.  They blocked out background noise very well. I could still clearly hear what I was listening to even when the cleaning ladies came through to vacuum.  Took about an hr to charge completely, out of the box.  Have had them on for about 4 hrs now, still going strong.",0
4.0,Update on MPOW Bluetooth Headphones,"September 9, 2017",Yes,"Though running Windows 10 pro 64 bit, my computer is older and I had to take extra steps to insure Bluetooth would be recognizable.  Pairing is good, but nowhere near 30 feet for the signal. Pairing and connection can be a nightmare, as well as trying to use the controls on the Right earpad...MPOW was kind enough to send a their latest bluetooth headphones and the improvement is incredible good.  Pairing and placement of the controls are exceptionally user friendly.  Thanks!",1
5.0,Update...,"December 24, 2017",Yes,My first set had Bluetooth and charging issues. So naturally I put up a negative review. A few day's later they emailed back apologizing and notifying me a new set was on it's way. Work's as described no problems. My son's first Bluetooth headphones. He really enjoys them.,2
2.0,"Utterly disappointed, the cheaper Mpows are much better and a steal for the price. Returning these ASAP waste of money.","September 11, 2017",Yes,"I'm utterly disappointed in my headphones. other than amazing exterior build quality they need to focus more on sound quality. The balancing of voice to background music is overwhelming almost no sense of quality base just a bare vibe sounding for base. I previously bought Mpow headphones before for cheaper they didn't look as good but they were about 10 dollars cheaper and sounded noticeably better  the only thing these had on my previous one was build quality, comfort and better external sound buffering. I'm an avid listener of music and with these it just seemed off and not pleasing in overall sound quality like i said before the cheaper not so good looking Mpows are a much better buy. and for the price i expected better sound quality than the cheaper Mpows I'm giving it two stars because of the build quality and the shear comfort they provide. But those really doesn't matter if the sound is horrid.",6
4.0,Customer Service Treated Me Right,"July 12, 2018",Yes,"Their customer service reached out to me with another set of headphone. Understand they reached out to me with another set of headphone, which worked alot better. The new headphone fit a little different but sounded much better, the sound is ok to very good, about 4 stars. For the price them are an outstanding value. The customer service seems to be really motived  to corrected the issue with me, I would give customer service 5 stars.  4 stars for the headphone, 5 stars for customer service =  4+/5 stars over all..Original ad--.Title was ""Not that good""..Bass was muddy and treble sounded like a digital artifact. Check it with a bunch of music to see if it works with you and the music of your choice.",0
5.0,Perfect for my needs,"June 12, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these before a trip to Hawaii.  Knowing that I couldn't use bluetooth on the plane, I opted for a lower cost set of headphones, because I intended to use them on the plane almost exclusively.  Even without active noise cancelling, I could hear my entertainment perfectly over the engine noise. On the flight home, there was a family directly in front of us with an infant who screamed and cried the duration of the flight. While I felt bad for them, I was not bothered by him at all due to my gratefully purchased headphones. I would recommend them to any casual user. I haven't charged them for bluetooth use, so I cannot review anything other than direct connection.",1
1.0,volume is a way too low ... constant buzzing/humming sound makes we want to vomit ...,"July 1, 2018",Yes,"Bought it for my new iPhone X. The design and connection is good..However the volume is a way too low even when I set both of the equipment and headset at max volume..The constant buzzing/humming sound makes we want to vomit --  literally, it makes me about to vomit..Very disappointed with the quality of the sound.",1
5.0,Great hearing protection and the phone mic really works.,"February 23, 2018",Yes,I work in a wood shop with a lot of machinery. I bought these so I could have some hearing protection and listen to music while monitoring the incoming calls. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out I could connect to 2 bluetooth devices at the same time. I can listen for calls on my cellphone and tune into music from my laptop. I can easily answer incoming calls from my Samsung cell phone and the callers can hear me every time. This is one of the best headsets I have for noisy areas. I can hear the music over the machinery without having to turn up the volume to a damaging level. They fit comfortably for long durations of wear. I'll be sure to take them on my next flight to drown out the noise  from the jet engines.,0
5.0,Better than expected. Great for the $$,"May 6, 2018",Yes,"The wife loves these. They seem to be very well made and easy to use. Connecting them to her ipad was very quick with few steps. The sound quality is decent and they are very comfortable. We've only charged them three times but the charge time is fast and the usage time is good. Don't know exactly how long they last in hours as they are used a lot but on and off during the day, but so far the time to empty has been uneventful so I'd say that it's going to be fine...If anything should change regarding this I'll be back to update.",0
3.0,well I'm not happy with the features,"July 12, 2017",Yes,"I haven't had any issue with the unit operationally. However, I purchase this item based on Amazon's ""Best Buy Recommendation"", well I'm not happy with the features. I purchased a similar set of headphones from Amazon that are much better. The Mixcder ShareMe headphones have far more features...It appears every time the Mpow headphones activate, they have to pair with the transmitting device. In addition when you pair or if you loose pairing, you don't know it until you hear something or you don't hear anything. The Mixcder ShareMe headphones tell you when you're connected and when you are disconnected.",1
5.0,review for Mpow Bluetooth 4.1 Receiver and Transmitter,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"Eventually got 2 Mpow bluetooth headphones paired with transmitter connected to a Samsung Galaxy S3. Sound cut in and out, never could get volume very high (headphones individually were good)...Purchased for a long plane trip, not impressed but too late to return for something else..UPDATE:.Contacted and heard back from support who provided a solution to my problem. Updated the rating to show this...But will be checking with vendor/manufacturer.",0
4.0,Give these things a try. I don't think you'll regret it.,"May 26, 2017",Yes,"Very good headphones. I had a number of people ask me about them and they commented on how stylish they were. I don't really care for style too much as long as they do what they should. The ear functions like volume, play/pause, and next song worked perfectly. Synced up every time with my cell. Not quite noise cancelling but once you turn the volume up you can block out all the coughing, baby cries or other annoying sounds while on a flight lol. For the price you can't beat it. Definitely worth the buy!",1
4.0,... have the Bluetooth earphones from this brand and I liked them so I gave these a try,"April 29, 2018",Yes,I have the Bluetooth earphones from this brand and I liked them so I gave these a try. Earphones no mater what never stay in my ears so I needed something that I don't have to constantly ajdust while working out and I'm pleased with them. Four stars because the sound isn't amazing but I like them and because I think they're worth $25 -$30 instead of the $35 I paid for them.,1
5.0,These are great! My first set of bluetooth,"May 24, 2018",Yes,These are great!  My first set of bluetooth.  It took a couple of time wearing them to get used to the added weight of over er headphones.  Sound quality is great and they cancel out most noise (or put the rest of the noise down to a muffle).  They look and sound like higher priced headphones.  I am going to be buying a second pair for home.,1
4.0,"Comfortable, works great, long charge, wireless headset","November 15, 2017",Yes,"These are very comfortable (although heavy and will hurt after about 2 hours).  The charge lasts really well, and the sound is actually quite good.  My only complaint outside of the weight is that all wireless headphones I have tried have a really LOUD voice that tells you it's on or turning off, that you can't change the volume of.  I will know when they are on and off without the audio blasting my ears.",1
1.0,Muffled sound quality and not noise-canceling!,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"I returned these within a day for a refund. What's the point of headphones when everyone in the room can hear what you are listening to when you don't have them very loud? Also, the sound quality was horrible and sounded as though there was a plastic film over the ear cuffs making everything sounds muffled. My computer is Bluetooth capable, but I could not get these to connect.",1
5.0,Great headphones for the price.,"May 10, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are spectacular. While they are a little weak on the low end, they produce a sound that defies their price. They are crisp, and clear on most tracks, and if you are looking for a comfortable set of cans to wear, these will fit the bill. They are even comfortable with glasses on. I have not yet tested using the chord for the operation of these, however, I will have the opportunity to shortly as I am traveling internationally with them soon. If anything I experience changes my opinion, I will update as necessary.",1
4.0,takes super long to charge,"July 22, 2018",Yes,"Honestly the product is highly overrated..It dies really fast, takes super long to charge..It has zero bass, I mean zero, really..I bought into all the hype, the youtube videos ect..TRUST ME. These are not good.. if they're not DEAD the sound is clear, but not bold..Spend 130 on skull crusher wireless..trust me..just save and spend that much. Stop buying new headphones constantly. Pay one good fee and enjoy amazing music with amazing bass...P.S However they sent me a new one that didn't seem of same value, but nonetheless months later they sent me one which alone is impressive. They weren't for me personally, but you should give them a try for sure. If you're on a tight budget.",1
5.0,Great value. Comfortable over the ear and good sound quality,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"Snug, comfortable over the ear fit that effectively block out outside noise. Great sound quality for the price. Very simple operation - automatically pairs up with my phone when I turn it on, and the volume / next / previous track operations are easy to find and use. Sturdy feel. I have tried a number of Bluetooth headphones looking for a decent pair that didn't cost an arm and a leg and am very happy with these.",1
4.0,Sounds great,"June 26, 2017",Yes,Good range for a bluetooth device.  Sounds great and is easy to connect.  The only issues I have is there needs to be raised areas on the control pad so you can actually feel the controls.  It is too easy to pause the song when all I want to do is go to the next song...nearly impossible to feel the controls when they are on your head.,2
5.0,The Sweet Sound of Music,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"Let me start off by saying Mpow really stands by their products. I had an issue with my headphones and wrote my review without contacting them 1st. I really love these headphones phones, the sound they pack and the price I couldn't ask for more. Oh and the battery life is amazing. Mpow saw my review contacted me right away and informed me they were sorry that I had the problem and sent me a pair. THANK YOU, THANK YOU THE SOUND OF MUSIC IS BACK. Anyone looking for great sounding headphones that won't break the bank try these 1st.",2
3.0,Comfortable. Sound good. Solid Bluetooth performance. Microphone is garbage.,"May 5, 2017",Yes,"I just got these last night. Used them for about 3 hours and battery still shows 100%. The sound quality is really good and they are comfortable...Bluetooth performance was solid. I have JBL Bluetooth headphones that I use with same phone and same environment and sound was choppy. These mpow headphones were solid...Update after a few months. These are great headphones, but they are absolutely horrible for talking on the phone. No one can hear me talking.  Therefore, I dropped my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. Amazon no longer show an option to contact seller so I guess I'm stuck.",1
5.0,Going strong over 1 year!,"September 7, 2018",Yes,My 12 year old daughter loves these! She wears them every single day and has since July 2017. She has the green ones and is very happy with them. We charge them up overnight and they never run out of battery on her. Works great with ipad and iphone bluetooth connection. I'm glad we didn't buy anything that cost more because these are perfect for her. I highly recommend these.,1
3.0,"While the sound was fine, the headphones were too tight and didn't totally ...","April 18, 2018",Yes,"While the sound was fine, the headphones were too tight and didn't totally cover my ears  They were uncomfortable after a short time.  I returned them for a different product...*** Editted 5/3 ***  While I did return these, the seller, Patozon, contacted me and offered to replace these with the newer H1 version (I will review them separately.)  But huge kudos for Patazon's customer service.  Not a lot of sellers actively try to satisfy their customer.  I've increased this rating by one star for such excellent support.",0
5.0,I've used them for months now and I am very pleased with the purchase,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"-General-..For it's price, these headphones are a steal! I've used them for months now and I am very pleased with the purchase. I use the headphones with my phone, laptop and through the audio jack connection at the controller, I use them with my PlayStation as well. I've never had an issue where the device didn't connect with another or drop a connection when it was established. Once the headphones are paired with the phone or laptop, connection is instantaneous when the power is turned on...-Battery-..Overall, I'd say the battery lasts about a week. Athough it's a 10-15 days on a charge as the norm for me. When I use them to watch things on the PlayStation or my laptop, I usually use the aux-cord (it uses no juice that way) and connect wirelessly at school, while studying etcetera. Battery life is a non-issue with these headphones, you'll be amazed...-Size and Fit-..They're a little bulky - I agree. However the size of the headphones is comparable with name brands (Bose even beats), to me there isn't much difference in size. The parts that go over the ear are quite comfortable. I have big ears as well and even if I have them on for a long duration, I don't feel any discomfort...-UI and Buttons-..I had used another set of wireless headphones long before buying these and because the buttons were sticking out on the edge of the ear-piece towards the bottom left, they stopped functioning. The buttons on these are flushed on the flat surface of the right ear and they're sturdy! All of the functionality that comes with the buttons have worked with all my devices. Meaning, I can answer/reject calls with it, skip a song/go back to the previous one, adjust the volume and etcetera. I know, to mention this seems a little too redundant as the buttons are supposed to be functioning anyhow, but, the buttons function and they do so on all of the platforms (tried it on laptop/desktop, Samsung S8, S7 and iPhone 6s Plus and no problems so far)..-Recommendations-..1-) If you're someone like me, who bought four or five of the cheap earphones with pices ranging from $10 to $20 and want to stop wasting your money/time on backup after another then this is a frugal / worthwhile option...2-) Buy a case for it. I bought this one ---&gt; https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LVVZYN4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_TXVKAbSD97XH7..It fits in my backpack, spacious enough for me to store other items such as the aux cord, my phone charger and so on. Great help for organizing and protecting your products...3-) Buy a backup. :)..Cheers",0
5.0,* The sound is Great. * Battery Life is Long,"September 10, 2018",Yes,"I'e owned another MPOW device &amp; it did well, especially for he low price.....And Yes, the 'Bang for Buck' is High..* The sound is Great..* Battery Life is Long.  I like the option of a wired setup to save on the battery..* Pairs So Much better than other Bluetooth devices that I've had before...* My only criticism is that the comfort can be better...Still, it's pretty good &amp; for that I'd only deduct 1/2 Star...so, I'll give it a '5' on the star count.",0
5.0,No brainer for economy headphones,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"I have a marked hearing loss due to loud live music exposure when I was young so I cannot testify to all frequency response of these headphones. I won’t waist my money on a $300 set of cans to be able to hear the highest frequencies ( which I probably can’t hear anyway) What I can say is these are comfortable, good bass response ( important to me since I play electric bass) and I can discern cymbal response I’ve not heard in recorded music in quite a while. I’m seriously satisfied. Controls are easy to use and intuitive. What more could you ask at this price point.",0
4.0,great product at low price.,"September 10, 2017",Yes,"I think this is a great headset. It is easy to pair with my iPhone, MacBook and Amazon Fire. The sound quality is very good for a low cost device. it is very comfortable to wear while standing or sitting. It could be more comfortable while lying down but you can''t expect everything for the price. When I purchased the headset, I was unaware of the 18 month but it eases my mind as some of the reviewers complained about early life failure.",1
5.0,A perfectly nice headset.  A good price.  Great to use for walking and hiking.,"July 23, 2017",Yes,"Hello from Alabama - Gnat Capital of the World.  This headset arrived on time and works great.  The sound is fine - no fading in and out like with some of the Bluetooth earbuds I have.  The fit is fine and most importantly, they fit over my ears to keep the gnats out of them when I am walking my dog Hootie.  &lt;see attached&gt;",2
5.0,AMAZING QUALITY! GREAT BUY!,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"really awesome, great sound quality , actually bought these to wear at night when my hubby is in town so I am able to sleep, he snores very loud due to sleep apnea, and I cant hear a thing once im playing my sound scapes, so great noise cancellation even though these are not noise cancellation headphones, I can also switch between the app i listen to my sound scapes on and my music on my ipad, and the battery life is awesome it lasts all night and then during the day too. very glad i bought these. High quality product without having to pay the high quality price!",0
5.0,Not a big headphone user but WOW!,"July 24, 2017",Yes,I sit in an office where I have to screen cases. I started off using rock candy basic plug in headphones. I liked how my Supervisor could get up and walk around and listen to his music. I looked up headphones and also at Walmart. I found these after not wanting to spend a lot of money. I just got these and they are so comfortable. I almost could fall asleep with them on they are so soft. The sound quality is so crisp and clear! I made a phone call while listening to music and had no problems. I am not a headphone guy by any means. But I just may have started to become one of those people that walk around with them on. The price is perfect! Sure I’d love to own a pair of Bose but you honestly can’t complain! I’ll recommend these to everyone! I’m not one to write reviews but you guys make one perfect product!!,1
2.0,mixed emotions but too heavy,"June 9, 2018",Yes,"these seem like they'd be good, i didn't see how they sounded because i always check how they fit on my head first and these were just too heavy. super nice design, folded very smoothly, and were very pretty (i got the green) and there were very sturdy on your head, not flimsy, didn't move around too much. but they fit awkward on my head and i still kinda have a headache from wearing them.. and that was about a half hour ago. it's not that they squeezed too hard, they did a little bit, but mainly they just felt like a huge rock sitting on my head. i know this isn't a popular opinion of these since they have such great reviews 😅 but that was my story with them.",0
4.0,"Good headphone, ok mic overall good for price","November 8, 2017",Yes,"Pros:.1. The headphones fit perfectly, and even after wearing over time they do not hurt my ears..2. The bluetooth setup really very easy.3. So far after using them for 8 hours no charge needed....4. You dont look stupid wearing them..5. Works for cell phones anfcomputers... (you can use the mic for gaming also, aka discord)..Cons.1. audio quality isnt bad, better than stick in your ear headphones. However, they are nothing like Bose..2. The mic isnt so great with background noise... so walking on the streets and talking on the phone has noise issues..3. They could feel a little more soiled, as they can feel a little cheap, 'little'...4 Stars because everything I wanted is there and works perfect. Thank you",1
4.0,Good for the price,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"If your lookin for bass forget about it. But for less expensive bluteeth headphones these alright. I use them to listen to podcast while landscaping,an can hear pretty good over most outside nosies. Was using for about a month an alll of a sudden they wouldn’t connect to the Bluetooth got frustrated an had to use the aux cord that It thankfully comes wit later that day after I tried a few things was really simple fix. I went on my phones Bluetooth list an hit forget device then simply reconnected an back on track. For the most part the Bluetooth connection is good sometimes cuts out but I’ve gone through a bunch of these cheap head phones an they stay connected better then most",1
5.0,I have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"I have been shopping around for some good over the ear wireless headphones for a while, and decided on these. I looked at Bose Soundlink II, Beats Studio Wireless, SkullCandy Crusher Wireless, Sony Xtra Bass wireless, and more. I finally decided to get these, after realizing that $200+ was just too much for headphones. I have yet to be disappointed...These headphones are, most noticeably, built surprisingly well. They are a glossy black with red trim, and the red is a soft rubbery feeling. The sliding mechanism is stainless steel, and the folding has a tactile 'click' into place when opened...The audio is good. It's not mind blowing, nor is the bass, but it's fairly well rounded and a solid performance, especially for anything in this price range. For the price, they're amazing...I've used the mic for only one phone call, the other caller was unaware but did not complain and I never had to repeat myself, so I guess it works well enough though that's not why I bought them...The headphones pair easily enough with two devices, and can play from either one at a time. Powering off if slightly awkward, as it tries to go into pairing before finally shutting off (holding the power/call/pause/play button)...These headphones come with an aux cable to connect them to a standard headphone jack, which was an absolute requirement for me, as I don't want to be reliant on a battery all of the time. They seem to sound slightly better when connected with the backup audio cable, but that might just be my prejudice. The wireless function, if already turned on, will silently deactivate/power off when the aux cable is connected saving the battery. However, because of that, you lose audio/talk controls when using the aux cable. Not a big deal, most wired headphones don't control the music...Battery life is rated at 12 hours, but I cannot accurately judge that as I usually use them wired. Projected battery life based on what I've used would seem that a 12 hour rating is probably pretty accurate, I havent drained them down past 80% according to my iphone's battery display (yes when paired with iphone it will give the headset's battery level)..Overall, I am ecstatic with these headphones. They even come with a nice velvety drawstring bag to pack them in when not in use. Good sound, good comfort, good battery life, good features, great price.",5
5.0,Nice Headphones,"January 5, 2018",Yes,My Beats3 were stolen from the gym locker room so I said no more $300 headphones and went with these. I've had them for 2 months now. I must say they are rather large and it took some time to get use to but for the price they are pretty good. They charge fast and hold the charge forever. The sound is good in comparison with the Beats. Obviously they won't sound the same but as long as my music is loud and I can feel the bass I digs it. Good purchase!,1
4.0,A Pretty Decent Pair of Folding Wireless Headphones,"March 30, 2018",Yes,"This is a pretty decent pair of folding Bluetooth headphones for the price.  The sound isn't the greatest, but it serves its purpose and does it well.  I like the fact that you can also use it wired, and the button controls on the right side of the headphones are practical and easy to use.  All in all, a very decent pair of wireless headphones!",1
5.0,Outstanding Deal - Great Audio Quality,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"These are the best headphones that I have bought over the past couple years. I've been buying headphones from unknown manufacturers with good reviews on Amazon for a while in search of a deal. However, most would develop a significant problem quickly. These headphones have excellent audio, block a good amount of background noise, and are very comfortable. They also look nice, and the bluetooth is great. I have nothing negative to say about these headphones other than the bluetooth was a little confusing to set up for the first time. I would definitely buy these again.",0
5.0,Great headset for metal detecting!!,"January 23, 2018",Yes,"This wireless headset is great!  I use it most of the day and into the evening listening to music for the last week and a half and have not ran out of power yet.  I turn it off when I am not listening to it and then back on when working around the shop or backyard.  I also use it in the hills looking for nuggets with my metal detector with the TaoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter TT-BA11 plug into the detector. No more tangled cord and having your headset torn off your head when you are working in the brush!  There is NO noticeable latency between this two products~ very important when shooting for nuggets and pickers AND this headset is very comfortable to wear with great sound quality.  I have had this now for about one and a half weeks now and I have not had to charge this unit during the day and it does recharge rather quickly getting ready for the next day of use I would highly recommend this headset.  For those who metal detect, you cannot beat the combination of this headset and the TaoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter TT-BA11!!",0
5.0,Good Headphones,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"After using the Headphones for a month I have notice they are super comfortable to use for some long periods. I use them at work and have used them for travel. I have been using them both wired and wireless and so far have not had the need to charge them. They feel comfortable on the ear, not a lot of pressure. The head band can put some pressure on your head and typically I would just expand the band and that works. Sound quality is good, not great. After an hour or so of use my ears do get sweaty. Quality of the headset is good. It looks like it might last a long time. The buttons work great, have not had any issues when changing music or adjusting the volume. I have not tried to call or answer on them yet.",1
1.0,Disfuntional product and kind of a hassle to return,"June 17, 2018",Yes,"Took them out of the box the night I got them...read the manufacturer's instructions, charged them with the supplied charging cord. At this point the noise cancelling function seemed to work. Got up the next day and took them to work with me. (Whole reason I bought the product was peace and quiet at work) Upon plugging them into my laptop it became apparent that the noise cancelling piece no longer worked, it wouldn't even light up. Immediately tried to start the process to return them, but it only came up as ""troubleshooting"". Troubleshooting? Really? They're headphones. I've been too busy and I doubt it would be worth my time to press the matter. I'm using them as regular headphones to drown out the noise in my office.",1
5.0,Headphones for Lifestyle,"January 20, 2018",Yes,These headphones are fantastic. They sound amazing and super loud. The Bluetooth is easy to connect and work without interruption. The cushion surround the entire ear and they wrap around the head comfortably. The rechargeable battery is very convinient and USB charger work. The cord is a little short but no real issue..The option of using the mini jack cord when the battery expires is worth the while...The design is very slick and modern. Highly recommend the purchase of these headphones. They eat out the competitors by far especially for the price.,0
5.0,He is not the one to recommend 5 stars to any product,"November 14, 2017",Yes,My 10 year old use this for playing minecraft on pc (windows 10). He is not the one to recommend 5 stars to any product. But for this he says give it 5 stars. For me its 4 star as it was difficult to use as windows 10 headphones and the manufacturer should have given clear link to install bluetooth driver..For once i gave up and but found bluetooth driver with trial and error and it works flawlessly.,1
5.0,good bang for the buck,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"Day one: so far so good.  I've never owned high-end headphones so I can't really compare my experience with anything else (Bose, etc.).  But, despite being concerned about them feeling tight and uncomfortable when I first put them on, everything finally loosened up and I quickly forgot I had them on.  Good sound, the charge seems to last forever, and the Bluetooth has better range than any BT device I have ever owned.  I have gone two rooms away and I didn't lose connection.  But, if there was an interruption, it would reacquire very quickly.  I've only connected with one laptop so far but I remain confident it will work with everything I have",0
5.0,Perfect in every way,"October 23, 2018",Yes,I have seizures and these are the perfect headphones for me. They cancel noise and when you are listening to music you can hear nothing! No outside noises to cause seizures. I got them in a beautiful pink color and they have a nice gray suede bag to carry them in. I paired it with my I phone with no help just glancing over the directions. I have dementia and usually do not do well with new tasks. This was very easy for me and I am sure it will be for you too.,0
5.0,Best Headset,"May 16, 2018",Yes,"Love the color and the softness of the padding. I also like how you can  fold the headphones and put them away in the little gray velvet bag they came with in the packaging. Easy to set up instructions. Lastly, I really like the feature to answer calls while listening to my music or books. Great buy and really good quality.",1
5.0,Great customer service!,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"Update:.Excellent customer service. The seller contacted me to let me know that they have sent a replacement!..  I purchased two of these. Within a week of use by my 10 year old daughter, there was no sound coming out of one side on the red headset. The charging cord was loose in the port on the headset.  The headsets look nice and appear to be of good quality.  The blue headset hasn’t been used much and is still working as expected. These were Christmas gifts and I threw out the packaging, otherwise I would have returned/echanged the red headset.",0
2.0,The headset is very easy to carry around and they fit comfortably around my ...,"June 1, 2017",Yes,The headset is very easy to carry around and they fit comfortably around my ears (my ears are considered large). The buttons are easy to access and the pairing was straight forward...The downside that made me return this is the sound quality. Audio coming from the speakers sounded like it was coming from the other end of a tunnel and with a lot of static. No one could hear me from the built in mic. It is a shame because I really like the design.,2
4.0,Worth every penny.,"August 2, 2017",Yes,"Nice quality. Very comfortable. Good sound. Good bass. I don't have anything bad to say about them. I do, however, get swamp ear after a while because they seal so well around my ear. I wish they were vented. I can see why these are a 'best seller'. You may be asking why only four stars. Well, I haven't used them wireless yet so my review is incomplete. It's not meant to be a negative reflection on the product.  These are really nice, especially at this price...Mpow, if you're listening. Should you decide to refine this design. Make them vented, not full open back, just vented. Also if they could be a tad bit lighter, that would be nice...- kryptor",0
5.0,They work great!,"December 3, 2017",Yes,The other reviews of this item sounded mostly positive so I decided to buy a pair when the volume on my television started acting up. There were certain shows that were hard to hear and I didn't want to have to use subtitles. I didn't want a pair of ear buds but I also didn't want to spend a fortune for over the ear headphones. These worked exactly as expected. I'm definitely not disappointed. I would buy these again. They were super easy to pair to my tv and the charge lasts a long time. I think I might have used them for at least 5 or 6 hours without any problems. I did charge them before I used them again but I've had no issues so far. I'd recommend this pair of Mpow Bluetooth headphones.,1
3.0,The Bluetooth capability is fine on these headphones for my iPhone 7/iPad Air2,"June 29, 2017",Yes,"The Bluetooth capability is fine on these headphones for my iPhone 7/iPad Air2.  Sound quality is only average with a slight ""tinny"" quality to my music.  These are in no way 100% noise cancelling headphones....more like noise muffling. My major complaint is ear cup comfort.  After wearing the headphones for more than 30 minutes, my ear skin/cartlidge starts to get very sore.  Maybe ear cups need to be a little larger.  I am not a big guy and have a fairly small head.",1
4.0,NOT CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH ANYMORE- Update Success !,"February 8, 2018",Yes,UPDATE;.The Support person for the company contacted me regarding the problem. They gave me a directive to follow for getting my headset back to factory reset..I tried it and it worked !  So thanking them fir helping me out right away ... I did not have to wait long for assistance..————————-.Bought these in October 2017 and they will no longer.connect to my Bluetooth.  Do not know why..I’ve tried and tried . I will have to consider getting another brand. When they worked they did sound awesome but not anymore.:(,0
5.0,Surprisingly good for the price,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"Ok, so I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I am someone who with a more discerning ear than most.  I can easily hear the difference between 128kbps and 320kbps MP3s. I can tell when spotify is on the low audio quality setting, etc, etc...Anyway, these headphones are comfortable to wear, the sound quality is good enough and the battery lasts me at least a week at work. Build quality is good and I saved a lot of money vs buying some mass produced beats headphones...Are these headphones studio quality? Heck no. But they are good enough for using around the.office.",0
1.0,Do not recommend!!,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"I am a little late on writing this review. I bought these for son who like the over the ear headphones better than ear buds. He loved them and said they were comfortable to wear and had good sound and worked good on keeping sound out. The price was good and my son loved them. But after only six months they quit working. I couldn't believe it. No warning, nothing, just stopped working. I will never buy these again and would not recommend them to anyone. Save your money.",0
3.0,These are just ok.......,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"After reading the reviews, I bought a pair to use while at the gym.  After the 4th or 5th use, it randomly disconnects and reconnects to my iPhone 7 at a distance of less than 2 feet.  It's very aggravating and disappointing.  Second issue is, I have to attempt 2 or 3 times to power down before it successfully powers down.  All in all, I probably got a defective pair.",1
4.0,Four Stars,"October 4, 2017",Yes,"Too tight for me.  But OKay. Update 10/25/17 - Vendor saw my review and sent me another pair.  Fit my wife fine and she likes them.  Mine have loosened up a bit with use.  So, great customer service and I imagine they would be quick to replace if you had a defect.  I am still using mine and have added a star for the very responsive customer service.  I did not request another pair or declare they were defective.",1
5.0,Amazing headphones!,"August 11, 2017",Yes,"I have somenthing to say about this well-designed headphone, that's amazing! The best thing is just cost 30 dollars,what a competive price! The headphone is so soft and make you feel very comfortable, you can also listen for a least one hour without notice that you are wering. The only thing not so good it's the noise rejection, even you listen with high-volume, you continue hearing outside,but the quality of the song is pretty good! Also,is easy to operate, you can pair with a computer or smartphone just using the singlecenter button. You can adjust the sound level or switch songs with buttons around the center one. And there is more, the foldable design is what I love most, which makes the head phone takes less room. Another flexible design is that you can easily switch between wired mode and wireless mode. As for the battery which people care about a lot, once after taking a while tocharge, it can works at least ten hours! The head phone cannot work while charging but it will not be a big problem because I don't use it all the time.For me,the thing that makes it even better, is the really fast shipping, it onlytook less than 24 hours to deliver to me! I don't think anyone should miss it.",1
5.0,I am completely happy with this purchase,"October 2, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this for my son. These are not noise cancelling headphones but, they have remarkable quality. My son has expressed nothing but positive remarks. I am thrilled as I can afford these and not have to spend $300 on another product. I am completely happy with this purchase. A few customers mentioned discomfort with long use but, my son has had no such complaints and we all know how much a teen uses headphones.",1
5.0,"For the price, excellent headphones.","August 8, 2018",Yes,"Functional, good wireless range, easy to setup, okay sound. I have a pair of Bose headphones ($300 at purchase time) that are far superior at every level for sound and a better build quality, but if you factor price in, these headphones are the clear winner.  Equalizer adjustment is needed when using these headphones - highs and lows are muted. I would definitely recommend to the average consumer for TV, phone, and music listening but for audiophiles, you will not be satisfied.",0
4.0,it works great. Enjoying listening to my Country Music without bothering ...,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"The instructions on pairing with the Mpow adapter with this - were not exactly clear mainly because of the ability to clearly distinguish  on the adapter the correct buttons.  Also if you are wearing the earphones to hear the voice cues, you can't be watching the flashing lights that indicate its pair(ing)ed)  Once you futz with it enough and get it paired, it works great.  Enjoying listening to my Country Music without bothering my hubby.  I still haven't figured out to pair with my car radio through the bluetooth though?",0
5.0,Excellent quality of construction and good sound for the price,"February 16, 2018",Yes,"Excellent quality of construction and good sound for the price. Battery life is very good. Comfortable. Have been using them about 1 month, almost daily. I don't like the flashy appearance as I wear them for utility, not for style--wish they had a non-glossy option...Microphone quality is average or slightly-below-average. When using for telephone conversation, I sometimes must repeat myself due to not being heard or well understood by the person on the other line...The ear cushions are starting to flatten after heavy use for one month.",0
1.0,Let's be honest guys...,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"I understand it's not a high-end audio equipment and not very well known brand... But it described having a very good sound quality and a rich bass. The very moment I put these on I wanted to take them off and never use again. There is NO BASS whatsoever. I agree that highs are playing well and it creates that disconnection from the outer world when you put them on... but it has an absolutely disgusting bass line and I don't wanna use it never again. Basic iPhone earpods got a much better quality than this piece. I even gave it to my friend to try them on and his reply was like what the heck is this... IDK what other 17k people are talking about, it's absolute crap. I'm really sorry..For $40 and for the size it could've been done much much better. I'm returning it.",0
3.0,"Bass is lacking, and cushioning is uncomfortable *Update*","July 17, 2018",Yes,"Great value, battery life is awesome, and the aesthetics are pleasing...However the cushioning on the headband itself and the ear cups are pretty underwhelming and I found myself with a headache after only a few minutes of use...Can't expect too much from cans at this price I suppose, however my biggest gripe is the lack of bass. It is so incredibly weak...**Update**..Mpow reached out to me regarding my dissatisfaction and offered to send me a different headset to try for free...I received the headset which is a Mpow H1, and it was indeed more comfortable. However the aesthetics of the headset in my opinion were really not great and far less attractive than the 059...I will give them 2 thumbs up for great customer service and am very pleased with their effort to improve upon their company and customer satisfaction.",0
4.0,Great great headphones for under $100!,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"Compared to other headphones up to the $100 price range, these are a very good set of headphones. Plugged into your device they sound fantastic, with crisp highs, clear range of mids, and smooth low bass. However, I do not like use them as a wireless set. The Bluetooth connection works great in the controls on the headphones are very easy to use and work great. My 11 year old uses them in Bluetooth all the time and loves it, especially when she's dancing in her room and watching YouTube videos. For me it's about when you use Bluetooth on any headphones you lose the overall quality of the listening experience.",1
5.0,Do you hear what I hear?,"August 27, 2017",Yes,"Paired quickly with Amazon fire tv.  Fastest of all I've tried.  Comfortable, but they are still headphone.  Good stereo sound.  Only issue I find is turning them off, but still not anything that one can't live with, just takes a few seconds hold ing button longer than I feel needed.  Be better having a plain on off ssitch, but..Would buy them again and do recommend..Now how about some quality surround sound, priced reasonably?",1
5.0,Get the mpow h1 much lighter and comfortable,"May 9, 2018",Yes,"Okay sound, but they do start to become uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them...Update: the seller contacted me about how these are uncomfortable and offered to let me use a different model, the mpow h1, which is much lighter and way more comfortable to wear.great customer service and I would suggest that people look at the h1 models.",1
2.0,"Uh, I'd suggest you pass on these.","December 19, 2017",Yes,"I mean, they technically work. I just didn't find it worth the money. I don't know if mine were defective, but they had a crackly sound, and my voice didn't come out clear (so I was told). Don't be fooled by the high ""retail"" price, these are not high quality. I took a risk in buying a brand I didn't recognize, and paid for it (although Amazon's return process was easy-- way to go Amazon). 2 stars because they technically do work, but don't sound very good.",1
4.0,"Good, but...","April 16, 2018",Yes,"They look great, are comfortable to wear and have good sound quality. My only issue is that they cut out if I don't carry my phone with me in the house. Kind of defeats the purpose of purchasing them which was to do chores and tasks without having to tote my phone around. That said, I am buying a second pair for my husband to use. He was impressed with mine and said they sound as good as the pricier name brands. He won't be up moving around when listening to them so it will not be an issue for him.",0
4.0,Great seller response.,"August 31, 2018",Yes,"Bought these in June. Paired easily with my iPhone 7. Worked well until September, then stopped pairing with my phone. Tried everything, powered off both phone and headset, turned Bluetooth off and on, still did not pair. It paired with my husbands phone and iPad. After reading my review, the seller  sent me a second pair, no charge. Seller responded courteously in a timely manner, which was appreciated. I rate four stars for the seller, as I am hoping the replacement pair doesnt stop working after two months. A really decent pair for the price, comfortable to wear. Hopefully will still be using them after the next two months have passed.",0
4.0,Great for the Price,"July 31, 2017",Yes,"I certainly wasn't impressed when I first used these, but I wasn't disappointed either. I've gotten used to them over the past few weeks, and I'm definitely satisfied with my purchase. I decided to try out the headphones with a cord a couple weeks ago, the sound quality is better using the aux line. Just for reference, I got these to listen to music (rap, rock, classical, electronic, etc) and podcasts...Overall, these hit the bar for me and I'm fully satisfied with my purchase...Pros:.- Connect to 2 devices simultaneously.- Option to use cord.- They sound good for the price.- Battery Life is more than enough for me.- They are more comfortable than I expected..Cons:.- Bass is lacking (which you should expect at this price point).- Bluetooth does cut out at times, but that could just be Apple's crappy bluetooth.- If you have above average ears, these will be a bit tight and uncomfortable at times.- The buttons are surprisingly loud",1
3.0,"Good sound, but uncomfortable for long periods of use.","February 27, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these for my cubical farm at work.  I was between an angry, techo loop typer and a speaker phone only person.  I was really looking for some good headphones to drown out the noise.  These do just that.  I haven't used the bluetooth connection yet, but the sound is good...Unfortunately, I have a pretty large head and these become very uncomfortable to wear very quickly.  I'm not sure what it is, but the pad in the middle of the headphones hurts.  It's not like there is anything solid or something is poking me, but even after I remove them, I'm still sore where ever the middle pad was resting.  As such, I have to take several breaks through out the day with these off.",0
5.0,Great Headphones,"March 13, 2018",Yes,I'm very impressed with these headphones.  They were delivered on time and came in a plain box with their logo and small description.  I like the idea of the company spending more on the product and not on some fancy packaging.  I bought the black pair and they look great. They're well padded and feel very comfortable.  It was pretty easy to pair with my phone and kindle.  I'm not an audiophile so I can't say if they're any better or any worse than a more expensive set.  In my opinion I think they sound great.  Good base but not overbearing.  No distortion of any kind even at high volume.  They sound much better than I anticipated they would.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone.  Money well spent.,0
3.0,"Music playback just OK,  Phone use pretty good, not much external noise cancellation'","December 15, 2017",Yes,"I love Mpow  products,  especially there collar bluetooth headset.  They gave me a free replacement after I pulled one of the earpieces out, great customer service.  Sound quality is not that great for music playback,  but using as a phone headset is very good.  Not much external noise cancellation.  I guess Bose has ruined me for life,  but damn they are expensive but great product.",1
2.0,"Very good quality, nice dynamic range","April 15, 2018",Yes,"Very good quality, nice dynamic range, and good sound reproduction. Run into a few errors where some audio tracks will stutter on occasion, which are not reproduced when using wired headsets...Update: Well, I've owned these headphones for a few months now (~beginning of April until July 2018). They've been solid, with a few technical glitches that were usually fixed by turning them off and on again. But they just stopped charging. At all. They currently still work while plugged in, but that's not why I bought them, and I have no real way to be able to open them up and take a look at what the problem is, as the screw alignments are placed frustratingly enough that you need a screwdriver with a 90 degree turn in the handle. I recommended them when I first got them, but 4 months is too short a lifespan for me to recommend them as a long term set. Maybe if you're desperate to get something inexpensive as a holdover to a better pair.",0
5.0,VERY good for the money!,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"Just bought this headphones. Was skeptical, but decided to give it a try... Well I do not regret! It gives you really good sound quality for the price range and size. I compare this headphones to my Bose headphones (which costs almost 4 times more). I am happy with this headphones out of the box. Pairs nice with samsung galaxy s7, sound quality is amazing for the price range. Little bit bulky for gym, but I survived :-) and happy. Stays secure and does not squeeze you too much (if you know what I mean). Recommend It!",0
5.0,these are great. When you factor in the price for the ...,"June 6, 2017",Yes,"I've had these for 3 weeks now. I use them daily at work for 2-3 hours and then I also use them while I mow the yard. Overall, these are great. When you factor in the price for the sound quality and the fact they are wireless...you can't go wrong! The sound quality is very impressive. I don't own a pair of the higher priced ones (Beats, Bose) to compare but they sound great for my needs. Also they are not considered noise reducing however the ear padding is nice and thick so you don't hear a lot of background noise. The battery life is very good, I got right around 13 hours or so of playtime before charging again. Highly recommend these for anyone wanting a wireless set without paying a lot of $$.",2
3.0,Sound over Bluetooth is terrible,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"It looks really good. Easy to connect to Bluetooth. Anyway, the sound over Bluetooth is terrible. I cannot even understand what my mom was talking about when I tested calling to her. I'm trying to contact to the seller for replace, maybe something went wrong with my item. Will update again after I got the new one and try it...Update.The customer service is good, they sent me a new one but not similar model, it's H2. It's not bad but still not as expected.",1
2.0,"Amazing headphones on a budget (UPDATED, not so great)","November 20, 2017",Yes,"UPDATE: So it's been 4 months and sadly the headphones have broken. On bluetooth, sound either comes out extremely tinny or only out of one ear. Only reason it's not 1 star is because they still work when plugged in with the aux cord. They're not wireless anymore though :( really disappointed. The instructions don't come with any way to troubleshoot this problem and I've tried charging and resetting...Really great headphones for the price. Sound is great and it's super noise cancelling. I can't hear a single person in my office calling my name even with the volume low. I can't keep them on for too long cause the pressure starts to give me a headache but other than that no complaints.",1
5.0,Very happy with these headphones!...,"March 24, 2018",Yes,"Was hesitant at first cause I’ve never heard of this brand. But after seeing all the great reviews plus the great price, I decided to go for it. Best decision I’ve made this year...Everything about this headphones are great. Sound is great, It’s comfortable and the music playing features/options are fantastic.  And They fold up great for storage(see my pictures)...Very very glad I bought these. And I might be buying another pair in a different color for a backup...Get these now!",0
5.0,"Use while on the riding mower, sound is great","November 17, 2017",Yes,"Use these bluetooth headphones while riding the riding lawn mower. What a pleasure not having a cord attached to my headphones and then my iphone while listening to music or a podcast. A headphone voice tells you when the headphones have been disconnected from your phone, which I really like and the headphones are easy to use. These headphone beat out my high priced  bluetooth headphones I was unable to charge. Happy with my purchase and would recommend.",1
4.0,Excellent sound quality and design,"August 5, 2018",Yes,"Bought this headset.  It arrived on time. It looks very good , great design. Easy connect to my phone. The sound quality is very good and clear no distortion. The range meani g distance from device is very good better than some of the top name brand ones. It's a little bulky  but not overbearing on the bulkiness. However,  this headset is not noise concealing which is a disadvantage  to this model of this brand of headset. The good thing is it still does not take much away from the Mpow 059 Bluetooth headphones.  I would definitely recommend this headphones.",0

I am actually getting it for my friend as his birthday gift.. but I really really really want to keep it now. Lol!! The headset is a lot of lighter than I expected!! It’s easy to use as it’s voice prompt feature will tell you what mold you are at every time when you press the main button. The covers for those earbuds are super soft and comfy!! When I play a song, the sound is great. It’s even better than my car’s speakers. The headset is adjustable and foldable... Love it, Love it!!!! Hope it will last for years!!!",0
5.0,Amazing headphones,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"AMAZING. Last a month without a charge. I am a dog groomer and I listen to them all day everyday at work, super comfortable. Very satisfied with my purchase",2
4.0,Good for music. Not good as a caller headset.,"October 1, 2018",Yes,"I wanted to use this at my office as both my caller headset and my music headphones. Great headphones, but mediocre as a caller headset. I've literally used it for just one day and already got a complaint saying that it sounded like I was in a bar... I was in a quite office with a co-worker who was talking probably 20 feet away from me and the mic still picked it up. Returning it and finding one with a quality mic...Update: they replaced my headphones with higher quality ones. Still not the best mic, but excellent customer service (+1 star)",0
4.0,"Great pair of headphones, poor bass quality","January 20, 2018",Yes,"Its a good pair of headphones. But everybody is different and its good for just laying back, listening to the music and relaxing. But for me, who is into dubstep, edm, and remixes, I would love to hear more emphasis on the bass. I love listening to music when its turned up, even as loud as it could go, the bass just was not there.  Sadly, this pair headphones did not fulfill what I was looking for. Overall, great pair of headphones, poor bass quality. The battery life mentioned is correct so it does last a pretty long time so based off everything, including poor bass, i will give it 4stars to be fair.",1
4.0,these are excellent headphones. The batteries last a LONG time,"February 14, 2018",Yes,"I'm not impressed with the bass response, however, your ears do get use to it. For the money, these are excellent headphones. The batteries last a LONG time ... like over 12 hours on a charge...They lose one star because of bass response and because you cannot listen to these headphones while you are charging them ... which seems like a really bad design decision to me.  But the battery lasts so long, it almost doesn't matter...I use them daily at work, and I would buy them again even with the inconveniences.",0
3.0,The sound is fine when the setting are right on my computer,"October 16, 2017",Yes,"I use this at work - it does keep some of the noise out - but one has to have something playing in it to make it quieter.  I can actually hear my keyboard at this point, so one can still hear things.  The sound is fine when the setting are right on my computer, but that could vary based on your computer and software too - so don't put that much into it.  Battery life is good - I get a good number of hours out of it before it needs to be charged.",1
3.0,"Not the best, but certainly not the worst.","March 22, 2018",Yes,"It worked well up until a few hours ago, though I can’t see any reasons why. Suddenly started flashing red and blue lights and wouldn’t connect to anything... and only powered down when using the main button, never cycling to attempt a connection. Loss of functionality..^^ Issue on old unit. ^^..Update: Customer services communicated with me about the issue and sent a replacement unit in the mail, which I believe was free of charge. The quick action and polite responses definitely bring the meager score up a few pegs...I can recommend this product to people, though only with words of potential caution. Hopefully I just had bad luck. That being said it seems to be a known issue since they are quick to replace things, so I suppose we’re in good hands if things go wrong.",1

I'm not paid to write reviews because I only comment if I'm blown away.......this earphone blew my wig off lol!!! I have been using it while practicing on my drums and it isolates outside noise extremely well. I use these in the shower and it makes it very steamy when u need the music in your ears only.",2
5.0,Decent Product,"March 7, 2018",Yes,"I have had these headphones for about a month now,.Quality: It's great, its comparable to higher end headphones except for base, which is decent. The microphone works, but its not great. Its a little low when speaking to others on the phone. Feels durable (and it is) and doesn't seem like it will break. The battery lasts me for about 3 days of use, and I use it regularly. Ear cushions are still just as good and comfortable, it goes around your ear..Overall: Overall this is great for its money, I'm expecting this to last me for a while and I purchased 2 more exact headphones for my family members , which they love. Microphone is decent along with base. You can cannot with multiple devices and I love the second Sound Control on the Headphones itself to give more variability to sound output.",0
5.0,Uneven Quality Control,"July 1, 2018",Yes,"It looks like you run the risk of getting a defective unit. I ordered one and the initial, straight-out-of-the-box battery charge took under an hour and then ran out just as quickly...It's really a pity because the fit of the headphones is very comfortable with my glasses and the sound quality is also really good, I don't experience any audio lag when watching videos. They feel quite luxe and well-made but something was clearly missed before this one was sent out the door...Update (July 2018) all the reviews raving about the customer support weren't lying. I was contacted, offered a replacement, and received it all within a week and a half. The batteries on the new pair have lasted for two days (+4 hours) so far on a single charge and the headset is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.",0

I’ve had others complain both on the phone and on voice chat on PC. I’ll stick with listening to music with these and giving up on the mic.",0

I can feel it squeezing my head every second I have it one. I tried for multiple times but never once I stood more than 5 minutes before the pain forces me to take them off. I regret purchasing the product and I regret not returning it while I could. This is the first time I give something a 1-start rating...FYI: I do not have an enormous head...EDIT: after several months of bending and twisting, it now fits my head and I do enjoy the sound quality.",2
5.0,Quality that exceeds the Pricepoint,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"I very rarely write reviews online. I tend to reserve doing so for an exceptionally awesome experience or exceptionally awful. These headphones are the former...The price made me hesitant to buy them, given the previous pair of on-ear headphones (non bluetooth) were similarly priced, not very comfortable, and had only mediocre sound quality...I've been delighted that I'm able to use these at work, traveling, and when I'm in a public space and need to drown out sound to focus. The sound quality is not what you'd get from a $200+ pair of high quality headphones, but for the price, it is far superior to the sound of its competition. Lastly, I noticed today that the range of the bluetooth is quite impressive. I was able to walk in my entire apartment without losing connection to my galaxy S9...I'd recommend these headphones to any student or adult who must study, focus, listen to music quietly in public, mowing a lawn, whatever else you can think of (except, probably not working out).",0
5.0,Stopped working after 4 months but seller replaced.,"September 30, 2018",Yes,"I bought these 4 months ago. I used them for a long plane trip and they were great. Now they won't charge and they won't turn on. I plug them in and the light on the side lights up for a little while as if it's charging, but it eventually goes out. And I can't get them to work. Garbage..Update: Seller saw that my headphones had stopped working and replaced the defective pair with a new pair that works great.  Great customer service!  Thanks.",0
5.0,Great product and also a good alarm clock too.,"September 25, 2017",Yes,"Very nice product with great quality. I have fallen asleep with these countless times over the last 2 months now and they are VERY comfortable, haven't had sore ears even once. (please note which ear is left or right, if you have them on correctly you will not have an issue. It comes with a male to male headphone cord for those times that the battery died and you need to hard connect it (like the good ol days) however, you shouldn't have to worry about the battery dying in HEAVY use (heavy being, like me, 24 hours a day of bluetooth connection) for at least 48 hours...I bought these specifically to have some noise reduction while also providing good quality of sound for a low price. I sleep with my meditations on and for times that I need an alarm to wake up, it has helped with waking me up when I needed to be for medication schedules, which is nice since I am a bit of a hard sleeper...Honestly, I would absolutely buy these again and I do recommend them to anyone who is looking for a pair of bluetooth connect headphones.",0
3.0,Paired fine with my iPhone,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"I purchased to use with a USB bluetooth adapter on a Windows 10 desktop.  Nope, it would not pair.  Paired fine with my iPhone, but not the desktop.  Also, I bought a 10 ft, shielded 3.5mm cable to use with it also, but the male plug of the cable was too large in diameter to fit into the small port area on the headphones and the audio cable that came with the headphones is very short and unusable in my opinion, unless you plan on sitting a foot or so from the front of the PC...If you want to use on Windows 10 PC, don't buy.",1
5.0,Incredible at price point!,"June 9, 2018",Yes,"These are PERFECT for office use! Now I can tune out &amp; so much more work done! Less interruptions from people while I'm working...Charged them for a flight. Flew 5 hours the first round, 7 the second round. Took them to work &amp; worked two full days before needeing to charge them again. Freaking awesome!",1
4.0,Great Product for the Price,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Positives:.-Good build quality. Headphones are solid and study for the price..- They're pretty attractive and look fairly upscale in person, do not seem like cheap headphones at all..- Comfortable. The earpieces cover ears completely and are made out of soft materials..- Battery life lasts a long time, used for several days without charge..- Ease of use, turning on/off and pairing is a snap...Cons:.- Sound is a tad bit flat when listening to music, would like the quality to be more immersive.- Sound leaks above maybe 70/75% listening volume...OVERALL: I think these are great headphones for the price. Everyone in this price point would be satisfied with most aspects of the headphone. I purchased these for my parents who simply want wireless headsets to listen to their shows or whatever else on their phone and not have to play thru the speakers. I've also purchased their THOR headphones and these are definitely worth the $10 cost difference... I'd love the opportunity to try out the new H5 headset and see how the sound quality improves but with the purchase of the 2nd set of headphones I'm not looking to spend more right now.",0
5.0,Nice headphones for the low cost,"October 6, 2017",Yes,"Nicely padded ear pieces and I love the detachable cord. I've owned several $400+ headphones with hardwired cords, which shorted out after a few years. I'd like to see this company offer the headphones with a narrower profile, suitable for carrying on an airline flight within my Macbook's carry-on case. They are a little bulky but for the low cost they perform well and I purchased a second pair",1
4.0,"Comfortable fit, descent volume, appropriately priced.","November 17, 2018",Yes,"The headphones look cool, fit comfortably, and connect via Bluetooth quickly.  The stellar battery life is equally stellar.  The material that fits around your ear feels of descent quality, but the material on the top of the plastic connector does not.  It feels very...manufactured? I'm not sure how to describe it.  Its not uncomfortable, it just doesn't feel like the material will hold up. The expanding mechanism is a little clunky, too.  Still, for the price, I feel these are wonderful headphones.",0
5.0,Musician daughter LOVES her Mpow!!,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"Bought for my daughter who has thanked me about 100 times for it.  This is not her first rodeo with wireless headphones, and she finds this to be the best that she has used.  She is a professional musician with a very discerning ear, but not a lot of money for the really high-end headphones.  She loves the clarity, ease of operation, the clear indicator lights, and the fit.",1
5.0,Treble and Bass Beautifully Working Together In Unison.... FINALLY! Thanks MPOW!,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"These are AMAZING - price, quality, great fit, sound and craftsmanship! High and low sounds equalize beautifully with these wireless earphones - especially given the price - Under $40! Cannot complain at all! I had purchased these MPOW headphones after taking the plunge on the SONY 1000XM2 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones for $349.99. Holy DISAPPOINTING! Bass was little to non existent with treble really dominating. Yuck! I'll be returning the SONY headphones tomorrow and keeping these! Thanks so much, MPOW!",0
5.0,100% spot on,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"Amazing sound quality, even went out side 100' away and no drop and had me rocking for hours out of the box. Comfortable good fit, we will see what time tells me...Update: after HOURS of listening to these and using Audition for audio editing, these are outstanding for the price and I have a long back ground in audio, there better than my wifes 150.00 sony's. BANG and she wonders why I am bouncing my head LOL",0
3.0,"Feels cheap, started falling apart quickly, not the best design","November 19, 2018",Yes,"I know I didn't pay top dollar for this, but I still feel that this is a mixed bag..Cons:.- Within a couple weeks the fo leather started to separate from the plastic (as pictured).- One button controls power, sync, pause, play and phone calls, which can get tedious. To turn it off you need to hold the button down for maybe 5 seconds..- All the buttons are right next to each other and completely flat, so you're pretty much guessing which button you're about to press..- If you use them while walking/running be prepared to hear a lot of plastic creaking noises..- Sometimes sound starts to cut out pretty bad, have to turn it off and on again to fix it..- When the battery gets low in starts making this obnoxious beeping sound, which effectively shortens the battery life as I no longer want to use them until I can charge them and get rid of the beep...Pros:.- Decent battery life.- Decent sound quality. Not great, but about what I expected from a bluetooth headphone set at this price..- Look nice..- Pretty comfortable.",0
2.0,You get what you paid for.,"June 30, 2018",Yes,Decent sound. Above average battery life. Cheaply made with inferior materials. Purchased in March with an average of two hours per week usage and the cover for headband cushion came off. (See photo).*Kept at home. Used mostly for listening to audio books. Never used while exercising..Would not recommend.,1
4.0,Really good product.,"June 30, 2017",Yes,These work great.  Sound great.  Connect via bluetooth easily.  They were more on ear than over ear.  So I did not find them comfortable.  My son loves them.  He is 8.5 and they fit him well and he can use all the features.  If the ear muffs were a little bigger I would buy them for the whole family.,2
3.0,What you should expect for the price.,"September 25, 2017",Yes,"Update: lol, after leaving my original review the company sent a very poorly worded email in which I think they said they're sending me a free replacement pair? They quoted one of my positive points of feedback as being negative...Very comfortable to wear. I've got average-to-big ears and the cups fit fine. Headband also fits around my big head. Sound quality is far from optimal. Very much on the tinny side when listening to music. Bluetooth seems reliable. Connects quickly and stays connected. Casing shows fingerprints very easily. About what you should expect for the price.",1
2.0,Look for another product,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"It seemed okay out of the box. Had a cheap plastic feel to it. Sound quality is sub par. You can hear static background noise if charging and using it wired. It has severe problems with bluetooth connectivity at times. It paired with my devices at first but it took some time to detect. Holding the main button to turn it on and connect worked as intended at first however after a couple weeks it began to power off or disconnect randomly while searching for a receiver. It has a voice notification system with a lady saying, ""power on"", ""connecting"", ""phone 1 connected"", ""phone 1 disconnected"", ""power off"" and etc. While holding the main button for a few seconds to reconnect bluetooth devices it would power off or disconnect although the connecting lights were still flashing. Holding the main button again would power off a second time, sometimes the voice notifications would overlap with each other. It still works wired and wireless can be a hassle at times. I now use it as a backup in case my main headset has problems. It's not worth 35 dollars. You'll find better products cheaper or at the same price...PROS:.You can manage it to work somehow...CONS:.Sub par sound quality.Unoptimized bluetooth system.Cheap feel to it.Buttons are clunky",0
5.0,Best Value for its Price,"July 3, 2017",Yes,"Battery had some problem initially and customer service offered a replacement quickly. The sound quality is truly impressive. Comparing this to a wired headphone that I used for a long time, this clearly wins. The noise cancellation isn't active like they said, so it won't drown out every noise. It's actually quite comfortable but I wear them for around 2 hours at a time so my ears get a little irritated.",2
2.0,Failed to charge in first six months,"May 16, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE After I posted the one-star negative review below, the company suddenly remembered their promise to send me replacement headphones, which I received. Since I already bought new headphones from another company, I gave the replacement headphones to one of my sons. If he doesn't have any complaints or issues after a few months, I'll amend this review further...Failed to retain a charge after less than six months of very occasional use. Manufacturer offered to send me replacement but after mailing the broken pair back at my expense I haven't heard from them for six weeks.  Lost cause.",0
5.0,Best Headphones for the Price!,"April 11, 2018",Yes,"These headphones sound good, feel fine, and are easy to use. Best of all, they are reasonably priced. They shipped and arrived quickly, and the seller (Patozon) even contacted me after to see if things were going well..The addition of a 3.5mm cable made these even more versatile too, and they also came with a nice carrying bag. The headphones also fold up nicely and do not feel cheap. There is even a microphone built in that will get the job done well..The only point of improvement could be the comfort. I can wear them for a few hours just fine, but definitely not all day. But the seller addressed this in their follow up email by suggesting your head/ears take a break every 2hrs or so. But honestly, if you are looking for something to wear all day, you're going to have to look at the high-end stuff (Bose, etc). So, this didn't warrant a rating markdown imo..Definitely satisfied.",0
2.0,"Uncomfortable, and little adjustments","October 20, 2017",Yes,"Only one, physical adjustment to the length of one side. Unlike other headphones, there's no width adjustment. I found them too tight, and bending the mostly plastic frame to widen didn't work.  Unpleasant to wear after a few minutes.  This could be fixed by a center, width adjustment, but that isn't an option here.  Really don't like them, although the sound quality is OK.",1
5.0,Best Headphones I Have Ever Owned.,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"For someone who simply cannot abide ear buds these are absolutely perfect...They are adjustable, the ear foam forms swivel so they rest perfectly on your head, and they do go around your ears comfortable and muffle most common noises. I cannot hear my partner when they are trying to talk to me when I have these on even when they are just three feet away...The sound quality is amazing and clear,  the cords are of a tough material and resist kinking. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time as well...I have not used the bluetooth function yet, as I stick to the wired option which suits me just fine. After I bought this pair my fiance decided to buy a pair as well.",0
5.0,Once You Understand That A Standard TV Needs a Separate Bluetooth Transmitter The Headset is Outstanding,"September 22, 2017",Yes,"My Mpow Headphones arrived at the scheduled time.  I didn't realize that my TV required that I also order a bluetooth transmitter.  I ordered one and after it arrived I was able to make the headphones work.  The documentation that came with the headphones was too rudimentary to be helpful to me, but their website helped me to understand what needed to be done.  I use DIRECTV as my provider, and finally realized that I had to attach the bluetooth transmitter to the DIRECTV receiver and not to my actual television...I've been using the headphones for two weeks and am very satisfied with their performance.  My wife is pleased, because she no longer has to put up with the increased volume I used to need in order to hear our television.  The TV still puts out volume which enables her to watch at her level of sound and me at mine...Should have done this sooner.",1
5.0,"Liked the one I got for my son so much, I got one too.","September 10, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable to wear with great sound. I really like the controls on the side of them to control volume, play and pause, in addition to the bonus of being able to answer the phone through them, which wasn't why I got them but it works great. Great value for what they cost.",1
5.0,Exceeded my expectations!!,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"My husband and I live realistically, our 12 year old going on 20 does not! He wanted high priced headphones, so I searched for a pair that would be somewhat comparable, BUT reasonably priced...I can not even tell you how much we were IMPRESSED!!!! I am sure that our 12 - going on 20 year old will be too!!! They exceeded our expectations beyond belief! Well worth the cost!",1
4.0,"AAA+ PHONES BUT IF YOU DON""T HAVE BLUETOOTH, BE AWARE...","February 1, 2018",Yes,"Hi, I bought these in Jan. 2018 and when I received them they were beautiful!  Just want you to know that you HAVE TO HAVE A WI FI ADAPTER (buy separately) to use these for anything that is NOT Bluetooth enabled.  I'm sending them back due to my TV and computer not having bluetooth and becasue I didn't want to buy an adapter for it.  They are a minimal cost but you HAVE to use the adapter on your TV if you don't have bluetooth on it.  Just an FYI.  I didn't have any trouble returning these to the seller EXCEPT that I was made to pay to send back:  $7.00.  I think they're a reliable company.",0
4.0,The cheap headphone that sounds expensive!,"May 30, 2017",Yes,"+ sound quality is superb for its price. I tried Beats EP and personally, this has more pronounced highs and bass, but not overpowering..+ battery life.+ carrying pouch.+ hybrid mode (can be used with included aux cable).+ connect up to 2 devices.average build quality..- voice prompts are loud. I have to remove them when turning on/off/connecting.- ear placement can be tricky. DO NOT use as over ear because it hurts. when used as on ear, it doesn't hurt as much.- may block some noise but no noise cancelling feature.- mic is inoperable when used as wired headphone",1
5.0,"Excellent product, does the job","December 6, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for hubby early Christmas present when they were on special (wish I would have bought me a pair) and he loves them, just need to get the wireless part going and then he can wear them without the cord connected to the computer...he does not have blue tooth on his computer, so I ordered a part that should help connect wireless to his computer.",1
4.0,Good performance! Material... not so good.,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"I had these for a year now and I can safely say that they are worth it! The battery life is pretty good(lasts for a day or so with constant use on bluetooth) sound quality is also great! Especially if you listen to bass type music as well!..The only thing I dislike about the headsets is the the material. The first day I had these headsets, I was about to wear them and they snapped near the folding junction. Also the protein ear pads started to rip too. I can still wear them but it disappointed me that the material is very weak. Other than that these are pretty good headphones to use!",1
5.0,"Really good sound, great value.","January 21, 2018",Yes,"These sound much better than I had expected. There is plenty of sound isolation, but you can still hear if someone is trying to talk to you. I like that it is a good balance. The range of tones is way better that I would have expected. They are comfortable, maybe a little tight, but still new, and will probably loosen a bit over time. But they are very comfortable otherwise. I am also impressed with the range. I can walk around my house and still listen to music, with only an occasional blackout or loss of quality.",0
5.0,Amazing working out headphones,"May 24, 2018",Yes,"I had to purchase these after my BT Headphones stopped connecting through Bluetooth. Earbuds fall out and I actually have to keep my phone on me during my workouts, which I dislike.  So I bought these based on the great reviews. I am not disappointed. I actually like these a lot more than what I thought. They sound great, batter is amazing. I have not charged them and have used them for 10-15 1 hour workouts. They do not fall off my head, they don't bother my ear piercings (tragus, forward helix, lobe and rook piercings). They are still going. I did not expect this for the price I paid to be honest. I can see the bass issue people brought up. The bass is not great, but it does not bother me. Now if this was a car speaker it would bother me. If I ever take my 4 year daughter with me for workouts, she uses the headphones to watch a movie. They stay put on her as well. Recommend these for sure.",0
5.0,Instant Disappointment UPDATED - Love MPOW,"April 8, 2018",Yes,"Sound Quality = great.Comfort = awesome.Noise Canceling = comparable to iphone headphones meaning average.Sound Leakage = absolutely atrocious.Verdict: These are not headphones, it's a portable speaker. I played film scores on Pandora for Game of Thrones and anything higher than 5 clicks up on the volume for an iphone and the sound can be heard CLEARLY as if I'm playing it on my phone's speaker (and yes this is while my fiance' was wearing them snug on her head, not with the headphones sitting on a table). So, if you're looking for a portable speaker that you can pretend nobody around you can hear, have I got the product for you! Otherwise, keep searching for those headphones that you can use for studying in a quiet area that you can use to block everyone out around you...UPDATE.Mpow sent a message to me that they were sorry that I did not like their product and they would send me a new different product free of charge. The following product: Mpow H2 Bluetooth Headphones w/ 4 Equalizer Modes, Hi-Fi Stereo Headset, Both Wired &amp; Wireless Headphones On Ear for Cell Phone/ TV/ PC, is exactly what I expect out of a higher end headphone compared to earbuds. While wearing the headphones, sound is muffled substantially without even playing music, and there is no discernible sound leakage while my fiance' is wearing them. In fact, I can't even set music low enough to be able to hear outside noise (even quiet film score songs)..Verdict: If you want headphones for studying or doing work, I fully suggest the prior linked Mpow headphones, and if you're a DJ or the surrounding noise is so loud that people won't hear what you're listening to then buy the reviewed headphones. Either way, Mpow is an awesome brand to work with. Thanks Mpow!",0
5.0,Comfortable,"June 13, 2018",Yes,"These are the most comfortable over the ear headphones that won't hurt your ears after wearing them for hours. I wear glasses so I can't wear those earbuds that fit around your ear and on the ear headphones hurt after three hours pressed against my ears and pushing my glasses into the side of my head. These are perfect, love the noise cancelling, and love the option to switch to using a wire when the battery needs charged and I don't have time to do it at the moment. Love the option of different colors. This is my second pair, now I have one at work and one at home. This was worth the price. I wear these at least up to 8-9 hours a day, five days a week. I use them at least 6-7 hours at work and at least 2-3 hours at home. On weekends it varies. Best headphones I ever bought and highly recommend.",0
5.0,The good: 1,"April 5, 2018",Yes,"I'm only giving them 5 stars, it'd be 6 EXCEPT the really tiny instructions.  The good: 1.  Sound is good, clear, moderate bass.  2.  Good quality materials  3. Excellent muffling of outside sound.  I'm using them for my TV/Dish Receiver and my iPhone 7 Plus. Pairing is fairly easy...EXCEPT and here is the only little detail.  YMMV.  Pair to the phone first, THEN the second device.  Except for this feature and it may be the iPhone issue, it was a easy process once I figured it out.",0
4.0,Best use if you live alone!,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"Great purchase if you live alone. I bought these headphones about a year ago. They amazed me with how well they actually worked! Every once in a while the audio might cut out, but this did not cause a problem for me. I always wore these while doing everything except gaming as they have no microphone. I noticed that they only seem to be on when they are emitting audio and then go into some kind of power saving mode while nothing is happening. My brother (who does not have these headphones) started lagging in his gaming sessions a lot, to the point where he couldn't move around. He noticed that he only lags when I watch Youtube or Netflix, or in other words when my headphones were emitting audio non-stop. I don't know why this would be what lags him, but we have tested it and it is the only thing that makes sense. Two of my brothers also have these headphones, but they only ever use them with the wire attachment, so they did not cause any problems. I've been living for a while now where I wait for my brother to finish his sessions before I do anything. I hope this review can help you decide whether or not to buy these headphones or save you the hassle of finding out why other people get laggy when you watch videos!",0
5.0,Awesome quality at a great price!,"June 14, 2018",Yes,"i love these headphones! after coveting a pair of BEATS for awhile, i shopped around and read so many reviews and finally settled on this pair of MPOW's. TOTALLY WORTH the price of 40 dollars -- they sound incredible, they fit nicely and they pair very easily with any device i want to use them with. so, Beats sound at a decent price! they get a bit warm when i wear them for longer periods, but what wireless headphones don't? i take these everywhere with me. Amazing.",0
5.0,Absolutely EXCELLENT Headphones!,"May 9, 2017",Yes,"These are probably the BEST set of wireless headphones I've ever owned!  I have tried multiple different types in the past, but others always seem to slip off/down when I'm working out or running.  These headphones ""hug"" the head, but not too much...Just enough to stay in place like intended.  They are also very durable and have a sound that compares to the much higher priced models.  I would most definitely recommend these wireless headphones to anyone in the market!!!",2
5.0,The product gets a 9.3 out of 10 from me,"July 2, 2018",Yes,"This product amazing for the price. I rarly need to charge it, plus it has a backup wire on it incase it does die. I have used multiple headsets from wireless to wired. I've had high end head sets from Sony and from other big name brands that cost 100s of dollars and the comparison between them and this headset is very little in the difference in sound and comfort. Every headset I have had so far managed to brake or they have just fallen apart from use. I use these when I work out and abuse them bad. And with all the abuse, they are just as good as day 1. They survived being dropped multiple times, which is great for kids. The range of the bluetooth on them is comparable to higher end headsets. I leave my phone in my workout bag and go all over the gym and they dont drop the connection to the phone ever. They fold up so it's easy to tuck them away in my bag without them being a nuisance. Theres only a few negatives I find with them. One they are on the bigger side so if you like discreet head sets and use earbuds this may not be your product. The other is the bass on them is not like beats but the sound is just as good if not better.  If you are an earbud person it wont take long to get use to them trust me.",0
5.0,A Better Sound,"October 26, 2017",Yes,"Trying something new and giving the wired headphones a rest.  Testing MPOW Bluetooth headphones to see which one is the best.  Being a first-time user of a Bluetooth device, thinking wired thoughts about how much funnier it will be, using Bluetooth instead of replacing wired headphones ever six months.  Hence, the test is how long with the Bluetooth headphones will last.  Moreover, taking chances with something different is what life is about.  The headphones are great, however only used when data on the phone is turn-off while listening to music.",0
5.0,Too good to be true!,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"I'm usually not the one to write reviews. I have had these headphones for about a year now. The battery has held up AMAZINGLY. It seems to me it actually lasts longer than advertised. Make no mistake about it, I have abused these things. I run heavy machinery. When I wear them they are always in whatever conditions that day happens to be. Up to 95% humidity, 110 degrees, direct sun, and rain. I have even left them out overnight a few times in extreme humidity. Last Wednesday I RAN THESE OVER with an 8,000 pound skid steer. As expected with any headset, they were completely crushed and ruined. Come to find out THEY STILL WORK. I ordered another set within 10 minutes and received them that Friday! I cannot do without these! They make 12 hours a day on machines much more pleasurable. Plus, I know when I get a phone call or text message I actually know. And I can keep working while talking on the phone. It's such a huge time saver in my profession. Getting 5-10 calls a day can eat up time quick. People can still hear my and I can hear them while I work. The ONLY thing I would change about these is this. I think it would be neat if it had a button you could press that would tell you the time. Otherwise I have no reason to dig my phone out of my pocket all day. Amazing headset!!",0
2.0,Sound Volume Deteriorates Over Time,"February 16, 2018",Yes,"I bought these earphones to replace my ear pods since my new daith piercing in my left ear meant that I could only place the ear pods in my right. I bought the headphones in December and I primarily use the headphones using bluetooth. When I first recieved the ears phones, the sound quality was decent (not the best, but given the price, I was content with the overall sound and volume). As time has passed, the volume produced by the headphones become lower and lower. It's now at the point where I can barely hear the music if I'm walking down a busy street. Every outside noise drowns out the music. Forget about listening to the music on the subway, it's inaudible even at the highest volume level. Even in the quiet of the office, I find the volume extremely low. I gave a second star because they make comfy earmuffs when it's cold.",1
5.0,Thank you,"July 25, 2017",Yes,"Great quality and fast shipping. Seller has great communication with customers..I actually bought these for my son to use for this coming school year. But purchased early for him to use on our summer vacation. (10:30 hrs. On the road, in mid-size suv.) And the worked wonderfully!. I couldn't hear games and movies while trying to navigate. And her was oblivious to anything else in the world. Noise cancellation! Great.",1
5.0,I love these,"October 29, 2017",Yes,"TL:DR: They are amazingly great for how cheap they are. I am very impressed...Pros:.- They pair very quickly, with minimal stutter..- They have controls! (I know, I've been living in the stone age).- They don't hurt my ears like the neckbuds from the same company.- Battery seems to last forever, and I use them every day for quite some time (I haven't thought of timing it, leave me alone)..Cons.- Man your ears steam in these things. I straight up sweat in the ear cups even in coldish weather. It's not a dealbreaker for me yet. Hey, maybe they'll double very well as earmuffs when snow weather comes..- If you expect exquisite construction, look somewhere else. The plastic is sturdy but still plastic. And you can hear them creak sometimes with walking or neck movements.",0
5.0,Great headphones for a great price.,"July 24, 2017",Yes,"I got these headphones for my son to use on our crosscountry trip, ended up buying myself a pair. One charge lasts for days, and the sound quality is quite impressive for the price point. They fit my 6 year old, me, and my husband. I like that they fold down, and you can use the cable. Also, you can use while charging. Definitely recommend if you're wanting an inexpensive bluetooth set. Also, the range is great. I can use them downstairs or outside and leave my phone in the house.",1
5.0,Impossibly good for the price,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"I am by no means an audiophile, but these things sound amazing to me. The battery life is incredible as well. I have listened to them for a whole day at work, didn't charge them, and then listened again for part of the next day. They never died on me but I did breakdown and charge them over night the second night. Even if the battery life deteriorates to ONLY being able to handle one work day at a time, that's still better than most of the lower end wireless headphones out there. For the price, these things are unbeatable.",0
5.0,"Comfortable, pairs easily and sounds great.","March 27, 2018",Yes,"Very well-made, sturdy, comfortable and sounds great. I use them to study languages and to listen to shows at night. I am no audiophile but when my friends listened to the headphones they were surprised by the great sound. They fit over my ears which is comfortable for me. They pair easily. I was surprised how much outside noise these headphones block. I have no problem turning volume up or down by pressing on top or bottom of circle on side of headphone; this is very important to me.",0
3.0,"Not bad, but uncomfortable","July 10, 2017",Yes,"Sound quality is fine, connectivity is fine.  Decent value for the price.  My main complaint is that these are very uncomfortable.  They are NOT truly ""over-ear"" headphones, at least for me.  They sit on my ears and the pressure, after an hour or two, is painful and uncomfortable.",3
5.0,Great sound at an amazing price,"August 11, 2018",Yes,"I bought these because I accidentally broke my son's old pair.  They were pretty expensive (over $150) Sony bluetooth ones...Having read a review that these sounded as good as far more expensive pairs I decided to give them a try.  He absolutely loves these, saying they sound every bit as good as the old ones...It was hard to believe that headphones at this price could match what were broken,  but the definitely do.",0
5.0,GREAT Headset!,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"I was expecting a much lower quality headset for the price, but it's comfortable, looks good, has a great range, and sounds awesome.  I did have some issue when I first connected it where the computer was trying to use it for communications as well and that caused the audio quality to take a nose dive, but one I disabled that part of it there were no problems and the computer seamlessly switches between these headphones and the headset I have to talking on the phone.  The only down side is that the charging cable is so short you pretty much have to put them on the floor while they're charging.",0
5.0,"Great battery, very happy","April 20, 2018",Yes,"These are great. I've always been an earbud person, but I got my daith pierced and earbuds hurt, so I bought these. The battery life is amazing. The blue tooth earbuds I have don't last nearly as long. These last for two days easy. I use them for calls and music. The song skip on the headset is great...The only con, is that they are a little tight, but seem to be fitting better with more wearing. Sound isn't as loud or deep as other headsets, but works great because people still talk to me when I'm wearing these.",0
5.0,"Lookin for good headphones. Look no further, get these.","April 25, 2018",Yes,"I fly very frequently and bought these originally because my beats quit on me and I needed something fast and not overly priced. I got these and holy sit they are AMAZING. These are probably some of the best headphones I’ve owned. These way out preform my beats hands down.they are completely noise canceling and have amazing bass. When I’m flying I hear no engine noise or anything. I wear them walking down busy city streets in NYC and Toronto and can’t hear any city noise. Great headphones and now my daily headphones. If you are looking for great headphones with amazing quality of sound and battery that last days then look no further, just order these you will thank yourself.",1
5.0,"Good Headset for the price, better then other expensive price ones.","August 5, 2018",Yes,"Easy to connect with my iPhone 7 Plus. Go range away from phone. Touch button control easy to use. If you like heavy bass sound, this headset is for you. Comfortable on head only complain as other have said, bottom of cup cover to low of ear, need to adjust for good fit.",1
5.0,Fantastic headset!,"June 14, 2018",Yes,These headphones look good and sound great. While they are not noise-cancelling the oval shape of the speakers fully covers the ear and drowns out nearly all ambient noise. They are foldable which makes them easy to travel with. If would be great if they came with a hard case as opposed to a pouch but that's a minor detail which can be overlooked. I had no problem pairing these with multiple devices and have not experienced any connectivity drops during usage.,0
5.0,Lack of volume was my only complaint.,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"Overall these are nice/OK headphones, but they don't get very loud at all. I've gone through all my phones settings, tried downloading different sound controlling apps. But no success...Edit - 3/28/2018.After posting my initial review, the seller contacted me and offered to send me a replacement set. Upon receiving the replacement headphones, the volume issue is resolved. I have changed my review from 3 to 5 stars. The customer service was top notch. Thank you.",0
5.0,Great product so far,"April 19, 2018",Yes,"I've only had them a week, but so far I'm loving these headphones. First off, they're comfortable and relatively light. I wear them for the majority of my work day and they don't hurt my ears. For the price, the sound quality is very good (much better than I expected) whether wired or over Bluetooth. But what impressed me the most is the battery life. I charged them when I first got them, and that charge lasted for around 30 hours. Better than advertised. I'm hoping that stays consistent.",0
1.0,Control knobs and bluetooth not working,"July 19, 2017",Yes,I bought this headset with high expectations but was very disappointed to find out that both the volume controls and the skip track buttons were not working. I was further disheartened to see that the bluetooth on the headphone was not working. I had tried it both with my cell phone and apple computer.,4
4.0,Very comfortable but carpy bluetooth.,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"Overall very nice, comfortable and clear headphones. The bluetooth connection is not so good however. The signal broke up within a few feet. I use them with the included wire connection for video/audio editing and can wear them for hours without suffering from crushed ear syndrome..Would I buy them again? Absolutely but not for the bluetooth.",1
5.0,Can't believe how well they've held up!,"September 22, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for something like $35 what feels like ages and ages ago. I'm using them now - after I've had a few other headphones break down, and they still work like they're new...I have managed to crack them - because my head is massive - but that has caused me to be rather strict on my material ratings. My Astro A40's and my Sennheiser's never cracked - but I paid over $150 each for those. Again, these are ~$35! Crazy value. Highly recommended.",1
3.0,Hurting tips of my ears.,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"I bought the headset because of the price and how many great reviews it had. It's a nice headset and feels like it is built very well, however, the ear pads on them are too shallow for my ears and it feels like the tips of my ears are being crushed all the time. I wear headsets for long periods of time and the pain from these is just too unbearable for me and i have to take them off and rest my ears every hour. I let my little brother try them on and he said they fit him perfect...My advice to anyone that wants to buy these, make sure you have smaller ears so they don't get crushed by the headset..(The sound can be a bit hollow at times).",0
4.0,Headset returned!,"April 6, 2018",Yes,"Not really sure why this headset have these high reviews, the build quality of it looks very cheap, the sound quality is not good either, I could not enjoy listening to music with these, not to mention that it has a terrible sound leakage, you can find better headsets for little more price..Edit: Mpow sent me the new model as a replacement, I'm giving this product 4 stars, the H1 model I got has a good quality build, the sound is decent, the bass is higher than I would prefer, but still good, over all seems to be good headset for the price.",0
1.0,No longer happy,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"Well, I am forced to change my 5 star review to a 1 star.  After only 7 months of satisfied usage, it will no longer work via bluetooth.  Kept thinking it was the charge cord or something, but nope.  I only wish to use this via bluetooth, but now I am forced to used it tethered to my computer.  What further distresses me is that I bought a second pair in July for my son's birthday.  I can only hope that pair doesn't quit as for obvious reasons, but also since I paid more to get a black pair.",0
5.0,GREAT headphones for the price!,"July 22, 2018",Yes,"Love these headphones. They sound just as good when used with the aux cord as they do with bluetooth (which was very important to me). Also, the battery lasts a VERY long time. Listening 2-3 hours a day, I can go over a week between charges. I will say that I think they look kind of dorky, but if that's okay with you, then I think they are a great investment. I bought these for $40, and I think they are on the same level as most of the $200+ headphones I've tried (not noise cancelling, but good for what I want).",1
4.0,"Cool, but...","August 18, 2018",Yes,"Aside from the soreness after having worn the headphones for a while, I really liked these headphones. The color is cute, the quality of sound is ok, honestly, but doesn't bother me much. I also like how theres the option to switch to a cord whenever I want...Overall, I like the headphones. I just wish they didn't make my ear sore after a while. I'm not sure if anything can be done to fix that but if so I am on board with that.",0
5.0,My second review after being in touch with their support team.,"September 22, 2017",Yes,OK first I had difficulty setting up this headphone with my bluetooth but the support team jumps right in and help me overcome the problem. Now it works great! and I highly recommend this product and the company !..Thank you so much,2
4.0,... I hoped but they are cheap and it's way better than trying to turn up my TV to hear ...,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"The top of the headband was not as cushy as I hoped but they are cheap and it's way better than trying to turn up my TV to hear the dialogue on some shows and waking the neighbors with the commercials.  They're a good move if you're not sure how much you really need Bluetooth headphones.  You don't need to put in a code if you're just pairing them with a Bluetooth transmitter like the Taotronics transmitter; just put them both to ""pair"" and they will connect.",1
4.0,Cheaply made audio cord/ Good customer service,"February 19, 2018",Yes,Bought for my daughter for Xmas since she loves music. Sad to say it only lasted for a month and a half. The audio input wire where the jack goes into her iPad broke in half. She has had plenty of headphones and this has never happened so I'm leaning on the side of poorly made and not accidental...Edit..After writing the above review and posting it I received an email from the company letting me know they we're sorry and sent me a replacement cord. I'm still out $8 because I had bought a cord prior to the email. Changed to 4 stars for thier customer service. I still believe the part should not had broke off and is cheap metal.,0
5.0,"Amazing, Simply Amazing","March 21, 2018",Yes,"Oh man these things are awesome. Don't waste your hard-earned money on the high-end brands because these are just perfect. I needed a pair to wear when I went to the gym or walking. I have not fully tested the range on these yet but I have been at least 50 feet away from my phone and the connection has been nothing less than perfect. Turn on your Bluetooth on the phone, press the power button on the headsets for about 5 seconds and it automatically syncs. It's as easy as that.",0
3.0,You could probably spend more on worse headphones,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"Pro: inexpensive headphones.con: cheap headphones..If you're an audiophile... well, you're probably not looking at these headphones anyway, but if you're looking for some inexpensive, comfortable headphones that get loud enough to hurt my ears, then this is a good option. These are heavy on the treble, but really comfortable on my (relatively) small ears. They do a good job of blocking outside sound, so would be good for an airplane, using a lawnmower or some other loud activity...One of my biggest problems with these is the button's don't do a good job of utilizing my phone's built in AI, and the buttons don't have any texture on them. So there have been several times where I tried to pause the music, but instead changed the volume or skipped a track. It seems like an easy enough thing to think about, but all the buttons are kind of close together and hard to differentiate by feel...I'm not so disappointing with these that I will return them, but I want you to understand what you are getting before you buy them.",0
3.0,Comfy but blinky,"February 15, 2018",Yes,"I like these, the sound is definitely decent and the controls are pretty easy to use. They're comfortable enough that I can even fall asleep in them. My only real complaint is the obnoxious flashing bright light on one side. There doesn't appear to be a simple way to turn it off and being that it's around the controls, I can't just put a piece of tape or something over it. When using them in a dark room it is very distracting to see a bright flash out of the corner of your eye at random intervals.",0
5.0,I purchased these after doing considerable research on a good set of headphones under $100,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these after doing considerable research on a good set of headphones under $100.  I am glad I did...I have used these for a trans Atlantic flight as well as listening to music and watching shows on my computer...They are very comfortable, have great sound for the price, and the battery lasts a really long time.  The best part is that they can be used passively with a 3.5mm jack (included)...Buy these, you won't be disappointed.",0
5.0,Best human hearing range ever,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"I'm a junky on headphones and I'm different  from musicians. I'm nobody. I have Grados i80s , Sony MDR(excellent by the way) , Sennheisers and the Koss portable pros. These head phones are right there with them if not better. The comfort and the sound is incredible My first pair disappeared. Why? They stole them. Beats, beware. There is a real sheriff in town. Very good.",1
5.0,Great sound,"May 14, 2018",Yes,"I've used these only as plug-ins so far, but they have worked flawlessly for me. I got them so I could listen to training videos at work and not disturb other people. But I also need to be able to hear things going on around me. These are great! They fit comfortably on my ears, even with glasses. I haven't worn them for extended periods of time, so I can't speak to long-term comfort. For what I'm using them for, they have been exactly what I wanted.",0
5.0,Highly recommended,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I am not a sound geek in any way. However, even I can tell the sound quality on these is good. Easy to set up-really important to me. I didn't rate battery life yet because I have only been using for a few days and haven't needed to charge-so I am guessing it will be 5 stars. The only drawback is that the headphones are a bit narrow. For me I still think it's 5 stars overall, but since some people need a bigger headphone width, I probably could go with 4.5 stars. (btw-I am average sized with a slightly bigger than average head according to my hat size.)",0
5.0,Only worked for 4 months,"December 28, 2017",Yes,Re writing this it was my mistake and I want to apologiez to the vendor. The wire was the one that got damage but that was our fault. Again so sorry please everyone know this product is durable and great. I bought around 13 different brands becuase my brother has a hard time keeping them. And so far this one has lasted amd I hope it continues.,1
5.0,"Good value headset, bluetooth works well/easily, sound quality good.","October 21, 2017",Yes,Quality seems pretty good given the price - very good value..We have the expensive alternatives - incredibly expensive alternatives - and seeing as how you could have 8-10 of these for one of those... this is stronger ROI..My son says sound is good and he uses it - that is a good sign! Blue tooth ops with Microsoft Surface Pro4 so far have been seamless - easy (if not flawless - my son gives up).  Recommended!,1
4.0,Don't expect an exchange if the headphones are defective! (update!),"November 6, 2017",Yes,"I bought these headphones as a gift and it only took days for the recipient to complain to me that they were defective.These headphones feel cheap and sound horrible when plugged to the computer. Also it took me days to finally get a serious exchange offer from them, after several days of them giving me horrible technical advice. To make it an even worse experience they wanted for me to pay shipping. Only if it was less than $6 or else I needed confirmation from them to even get a refund for that cost afterwards. Not very good customer service. You get what you pay for I guess, lesson learned...UPDATE:.Okay so after I wrote this review I received a new pair of headphones and the recipient of the gift has no complaints now. The headphones work and sound good. I just wanted to update this for anyone that is considering purchasing them. I also updated this review to 4 stars.",1
5.0,Fabulous headphones &amp; great customer service,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Best headphones ever. Love them. Super comfy. Long battery life...After about six months they started getting fuzzy and would drop the connection. I updated my review and said that they didn't work well anymore and took away some stars. Later on I got the idea of restarting my phone and they magically worked again, so it wasn't the headphones' fault; it was my phone's fault. Meanwhile, I'd forgotten about my negative review when suddenly the company contacted me that they had read my review and were sending me a new set of headphones. Wow! Amazing customer service. What a great company!",0
3.0,No One Wants to Hear Your Music Through Your Headphones,"July 2, 2017",Yes,"They fit nicely. Very comfortable actually. The sound is pleasant (though don't expect a ton of bass). However, the point of headphones is to keep music to oneself. What I dislike about these headphones is, even on a medium volume, you can hear the music outside of wearing them. No one wants to hear other people's music whilst they've on headphones/earbuds...**Update: Since reviewing this product, the company has sent a replacement product, the Avantree 40 ... Honestly, I have the same distaste. I actually use the originally purchased instead because they're more comfortable.",1
3.0,"Not Bad, Not Amazing","May 18, 2017",Yes,"They're good for the money you're spending..The sound could do to be louder, but on the other hand I'm fairly certain I'm going deaf..Had a problem with people from apps like Skype and ICQ hearing me from my phone but people using my actual phone connection could hear fine..They're comfortable even after extended use..I can't hear anything from the outside world but everyone around me can pmuch hear exactly what I'm listening to and I don't like that much",1
4.0,I really like these headphones.,"March 20, 2018",Yes,"I really like these headphones..I can wear them for hours, without feeling any pressure on my ears...The battery time is amazing. I have these headphones for about a month now, and only had to charge them 3 times,.and i'm using them almost every day...When watching movies, using my phone or amazon fire tv stick, it has no sound lag..The only time i noticed some high Latency is when i watched YouTube over Amazon fire tv stick..But when i'm watching Netflix over Amazon fire tv stick, it has no lag at all, so i guess it's a problem only with youtube over Amazon fire tv..I had some concerns it will have a Latency problem when watching movies, because this was always a problem with bluetooth headphones,.but it's actually very good...It take some time to get used to the control buttons..For the first few times, i had to take the headphones off, to see where is the button i wanted to click on...Also, i wish the charging cable would be a little longer...Overall, i'm happy with these headphones.",0
5.0,Support very helpful with getting me a working pair.,"February 17, 2018",Yes,My experience with these headphones haven't been the best. Not sure if I got a bad pair or anything. These headphones are okay for basic use while they're plugged in but their Bluetooth isn't anything to write home about. The audio for my pair is quite bad while using the Bluetooth connection so I'm only using them now with the wire included to directly connect them to my device. Will change my review if anything changes or if I get a replacement pair with proper Bluetooth sound...Update 2/23/2018.I received a replacement pair and I no longer have my previous problem! Amazing support.,0
5.0,Great Inexpensive Bluetooth Headphones - Buy with Mpow 4.1 Receiver &amp; Transmitter!,"May 29, 2018",Yes,No complaints here! Does exactly what I want. Wireless range is actually pretty good if you have a clear line of sight. Sits comfortable on my head. Pairs nicely with phone and Mpow Receiver &amp; Transmitter. Folds up into a pouch that comes with it. Only request is if future models can come with little nubs or knobs on each of the buttons on the headphones because sometimes it's tough to tell which button I am on when I am just reaching up to change a setting.,0
4.0,In the zone!,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I used them for the first time yesterday and I am quite happy with these headphones. They really are super sound blocking and the colors are great! They were very comfortable while running, I didn't need to adjust them at all. I can see how they may turn a bit uncomfortable if you have them on for a long period of time though. Since I will never use them for over an hour, they are perfect for me.",0
5.0,Great Headphones!,"May 1, 2018",Yes,These are amazing.  Setup was a breeze and the battery seems to last forever.  I use them at work and  I usually charge 'em up on Friday afternoon and they'll take me all the way through the next week.  I don't even bother to turn them off.  They are extremely comfortable to wear...in fact I find myself wearing them with nothing playing at all.  One of those rare purchases that exceeded my expectations.  I'm recommending these to whoever will listen.,1
5.0,"Great quality, love that they are versatile","April 28, 2018",Yes,"I’ve had these headphones for 6 months now, and I still love them. I use these daily at work to block out the sounds around the office. I love that I can connect these to my computer through an AUX cable, or connect them to my phone and/or iPod via Bluetooth and the quality stays the same. I have found these to be super comfy, especially with the padded band on the top of my head. I recommend springing for the hard carrying case for extra protection, but these have held up impressively with being carried back and forth from Home to work every day!..My only gripe is that there is no indicator of what percentage they are at when charging.",0
5.0,Best bang for the buck!,"March 4, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my 96 year old mother...she likes to phone in for her Bible study on Sundays, but was losing her ability to clearly undetstand speech thru her speakerphone. I spent sevetal hours researching cord-free headsets before making this purchase. We are both more than pleased..These phones operate via either Bluetooth or audio cable, so offer more options than most. They are comfortable, with goid sound quality, and the price was phenomenal! I am buying another for myself, and also buying tor christmas/birthdays before the price goes up!",0
5.0,I love these headphones!,"August 1, 2017",Yes,"I have wanted an ""over the ear"" headset for sometime; I happened to see these in an article I was reading from a publication on gadgets.  There was a discount code and I used it to finally purchase these headphones. I charged them as directed and used them the next morning while listening to the national news.  I was immediately delighted with the fit and ease of use.  I used them later a playlist from my iphone and the fidelity was outstanding!  I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone is looking to try an ""over-the-ear"" bluetooth headset.",1
5.0,I highly recommend buying this product!,"August 22, 2017",Yes,"Extremely happy with these headphones. It practically deadens all sounds around you. Good sound but not enough bass.  The Bluetooth link length that you can get away from your phone or device is practically as advertised... connectivity is good and I don't think I can find anything else that I can say about these headphones that I would explain to you how good these really are..Packaging is questionable but I can Overlook that because these headphones are amazing. Would buy again after these break, which I'm  hoping it doesn't anytime soon.",0
1.0,Sound stopped working,"November 18, 2017",Yes,"I was excited to use this product because of the amazing reviews I had seen on it. Unfortunately this product did not meet my expecations. Within one month of using it, the sound in one side stopped working. I was using the headphones with the wire they came with, so I figured maybe I damaged the wire by accident, so I bought a new wire. Unfortunately within 2 weeks of using the new wire, the sound again stopped working in one ear. At which point I realized the issue was not in the wire, but in the headphone. Really disappointed with this purchase, was hoping these would last longer...Update: The company sent me a replacement which I have been using for almost 2 months now. Everything was working well up till now. Unfortunately, the same issue is happening again, where the sound will stop working on one side/the sound will cut out. I tried using the headphone on my laptop and phone to make sure that it wasn't a device issue. But I found that regardless of what device I used the headphones with, the issue was still occuring. I appreciate the company for sending me a replacement, however, I wish that this defect is investigated and fixed so that I don't have to look into purchasing new headphones from elsewhere. I was really expecting these would last longer than this, but I guess this was the tradeoff for purchasing inexpensive headphones.",7
5.0,Good for the price.,"February 21, 2018",Yes,"For the price you pay for these headphones, they get the job done. I'm solely reviewing them based off of the price you pay. My only gripe with them are, they are very bulky and not that comfortable. I mean, for $50 you're not going to expect a great quality headphone. They feel cheap, the material is plastic and the control functions aren't that fluid, but if you're strapped....So be it...I ended up buying the Soundlink II from Bose, but I'd recommend those or the QC35.",0
5.0,Great Sound and Comfortable,"April 5, 2018",Yes,"At my age looking cool wearing headphones is a lost cause.  Tactically, I had previously occupied Planet Fitness sporting the most visually discrete solution I could find – wireless Bose earbuds which, whilst admirably serving my concealment requirements, lacked volume (another necessity at my age).  So, tempted by the good reviews and the audio quality subtleties of same-day delivery, I plunged into the world of over-the-ear sound… what a difference.  These headphones are comfortable and have wonderful sound qualities, the remote control functions are intuitive and the luxuriously padded head band is fully adjustable.  The operation for pairing is easy and, mercifully given my impatient personality, they arrived charged enabling me, just minutes after delivery, to be dancing obscenely around the house much to the consternation of my very confused beagle.  At the gym, as predicted, I do present as a senior reject from a Snoop Dogg video, but with the immersion is such wonderful sound I just don’t care.",0
5.0,"Mild bass, low distortion, worth every penny for the price!","September 23, 2017",Yes,"Pretty decent for cheap headphones.  Was skeptical because of some the bass reviews, but turns out they aren't terrible.  I think it really depends on what type of music (or other entertainment) you listen to.  For youtube videos and reviews, they are awesome.  For movies and bass heavy audio they definitely show signs of a $33 headset.  While listening to some rap/hip hop I was able to get some VERY mild distortion when turned up all the way - but again, there was decent bass.  These of course do not compare to Beats by Dre, but for the money they are absolutely worth it.  If you're reading this review because you want budget wireless headphones, then go ahead and purchase these - They are worth every penny!  Awesome range too, I can leave my phone and walk about 50 feet away no problem.  For those of you who have read other reviews who said, ""there is no bass"", don't listen to them - there is definitely mild bass.",0
4.0,Great Quality! Perfect for students!,"September 14, 2018",Yes,"I ordered these headphones because my Apple earbuds broke. I love the Bluetooth feature and the design. I figured with so many great reviews that it wouldn't hurt to try these out! I am so happy with them too! They don't cancel out all the noise, which is to be expected because that is what the product description says, but if you have the volume up I can't hear anything else but the music! I never thought I would enjoy over the ear headphone because usually it hurts my head because its pressed tight against the sides of my head, but these don't bother me that way at. Super comfy. I mainly use them for studying right now! Great for people like myself that are distracted easily and need to zone into study mode with instrumental music and only that surrounding themselves. I would also use these for running too! Very comfortable, great sound quality, long battery life, wireless and only $40! Love it! Would buy again and already recommended to two friends who used them for a few minutes and immediately ordered a pair for themselves.",0
4.0,I really like how easy that these bluetooth headphones are,"February 16, 2018",Yes,"I really like how easy that these bluetooth headphones are.  I like the headphones being very stylish and the fact that they aren't that heavy.  I also like the fact that they can cancel out noise while I listen to music, but do bear in mind that it can be a bit dangerous depending where one walks around at night.  I give it 4 stars though because the sound from my laptop on bluetooth is a bit different than when I'm listening to my music through my phone, but I have yet to test it with the wire.  There are two settings on my laptop and one may focus on one thing while the other option, which is the bluetooth option, is more focused on bass a bit.  Overall, I think it's fine and I would probably use them more on my travels and such.",0
5.0,Almost as good as beats,"May 17, 2018",Yes,"My beats gave out on me and I needed a new pair ASAP. I work at a place where I need to block out the noise to focus. These are a good replacement. While they aren't the same quality of beats, they definitely do the job. You can tell the plastic isn't as nice when you are holding it, but most people that see them assume they are beats because they look good. The sound isn't that far off from what you get with beats. Will only buy these in the future.",0
5.0,OMG BEST B/T HEADPHONES ON THE MARKET,"May 18, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones, they work perfect on my computer and phone and for the price you can't beat it. They sound quality is excellent...Update: its now jan 2018 and these thing are still amazing i have left them on for days and come back and they still work with out charging . i am really blown away with the quality of these headphones. i dont really write reviews let alone updates but i have to say DAMN im in love with them",1
5.0,I wanted headphones to go all the way around my big ears and glasses; SUCCESS!,"August 13, 2018",Yes,"I dislike headphones sitting over my ear, because I wear glasses and it can get uncomfortable really fast. These ones sit all the way around my ears and don't press my glasses into my head. The bluetooth connection is really strong, I can walk across my house and the music can just get a little skippy, at worst. The buttons all work well, battery life is pretty good and it doesn't take long to completely recharge!",0
4.0,Great headphones at this price!,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"These are great headphones. Sound is a lot better than I expected at this price point...Only issue is not even the fault of the headphones but more with Windows 10, and that is I have to keep removing the headphones from my PC and pairing them again every time I turn the PC off. This is an issue with both my gaming pc and my laptop, not an issue with my phone...Headphones themselves are fantastic!",0
5.0,So far so good.,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"Quick review:.1. this unit came well package, nice and protected..2. as for the close and hold feature, this unit was particularly loose right out of the box and has only gotten looser as time and usage goes by..3. This unit lacks the bass that the bigger company (more expensive sets have) but it does not take away from the sound..4. I still haven't figured out how to pair 2 devices to this even though it says you can. and I'm pretty tech savvy..5. The ear cups are soft enough for long periods of use..6. Im a sweater and use these at the gym almost daily i find that the construction allows for sweat and you wont fear that you will break this unit just wipe them down and get them ready for next use..7. the battery life seems ok. (truthfully I haven't had a moment when they died when I was using them (thumbs up))",0
3.0,Used At the Gym,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"This headphone is plastic construction.  It does fit an adult female with small ears rather snuggly and securely. It is NOT adjustable.  Due to plastic construction, this headset should be handled carefully as trying to over extend will most likely cause cracking or worse.  The interior padding on top of head makes it quite comfortable but by no means do I think it will prevent it from breakage if forced.  The ear pads are comfortable.  The bluetooth easily linked to my iPhone 6P.  It took a bit to connect to an iPod nano, but once connected it now easily pairs.  At local gym, it does connect to the bluetooth equipment but it can take some doing each time to pair.  The range is decent, 30-40 feet, but once out of range, it disconnects and must be paired again.  In terms of sound, using it for standard tv on gym equipment the sound is FAIR;  using it with my Apple device music the sound is GOOD.  It can feel and sound like being in a vacuum which probably is due to the headset being tight on the head/ears.  The max volume is not very loud, when pairing to phone, iPod and television each device itself must be set on the loudest setting.  On gym equipment, the volume is very low even with equipment at max volume and headset at max volume.  The volume control doesn't really seem to work.  I also own a Bose headset and the sound quality of Bose is amazing. MPOW is not amazing, not even close.  Again, this was purchased under $30 for the sole intention of being a headset to use at the gym.  It doesn't flop on head, is secure and serves the purpose it was intended for.  I would not recommend this for anyone that wants a headset to listen to music or surround sound television.",11
5.0,Update: MPOW Customer Service comes through &amp; headphones working flawlessly.,"August 27, 2018",Yes,"Update: Wireless connectivity ceased and I thought the headphones had malfunctioned. I contacted MPOW Customer Service (Which responded immediately) and they very graciously sent out a replacement headphone at no charge. Those headphones have worked flawlessly..I left the original headphones ON and waited for the battery to die. Then I recharged them and they have started working again as..So.. All in all.. The headphones sound excellent, the MPOW Customer Service has been excellent and aside from a temporary glitch the headphones reliability has been good",0
4.0,A solid pair of BT headphones,"July 20, 2017",Yes,"**Update: Mpow customer service reached out to me about my previous review and sent me a new pair of these headphones, free of charge and with no expectation to return the original. I very much appreciate the proactive approach to customer service, and after having used the new headphone set for a comparable amount of time, I have had no issues. Good range, good sound, and great customer support...**Original: The price is nice, and the headphones are fine, but after one month, they seem to not be holding a charge very long, maybe 3-4 hours tops, which makes them bordering on useless. The overall feel of the plastic is pretty cheap.",0
3.0,They get the job done.,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"The product works reliably as advertised and fairly easy to connect via bluetooth. My only issue is with the sound quality. It isn't horrible but these headphones are meant to be used as simply a way of watching tv/computer without disturbing neighbors without being held down by a cable. They don't produce much volume if you feel like blasting it. Has a bit of a stadium/hall sound. They seem to be more bass-centric although they don't do that too well, kind of muffled in the mid and high ranges...To summarize, they get the job done, and have worked reliably for the time i've been using them, no choppiness or lost signals. And on the plus side they have the versatility to plug into 3.5mm aside from bluetooth . I don't really recommend these for folks expecting high quality sound, but at $39 dollars it's going to be a hit or miss...I use these Mpow headphones at home but for the past 5 years I've been using Sennheiser HD 201 Headphones at work which has a very clear Mid/Treble sound (but less powerful on bass).",0
5.0,Hoping for a better run with the second pair.,"August 30, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these in April 2018 to use for my daily work. It's only been a few months and one side has died. Sound only comes out of one side now...Until now they had been working very well, and I had liked them very much...*UPDATE*.After writing my review that the headphones didn't last very long, I received a replacement pair from the company. I received the replacement pair in the last couple of weeks, and have been using them for 8 hours a day M-F since then as I did with my first pair. So far so good. They are very comfortable, and have good quality sound. I can't comment on the battery as I leave them wired to my laptop all the time for work. I'm hoping for a better run with this pair, as I really like the set.",0
4.0,Power button has more than one function...,"October 27, 2018",Yes,UPDATE - the company graciously sent a replacement pair of headphones and they DO pair to my phone now. The power button has multiple functions and it's confusing how long to press it if you want the headphones turned OFF after they've been on for a while. The headphones do block noise really well and sound great...I just got these but cannot get them to pair to my I-phone. The power button (on/off) also does multiple other things and I'm not sure if I'm pressing it long enough.,0
5.0,Thank You Mpow!!!,"May 22, 2018",Yes,Headphones are great and I've always had really good luck with Mpow products.  Here's the but though.  The charging port stopped working.  If you bend it just right it will charge.  That will teach me not to get the extended warranty...UPDATE!!!! Mpow sent me a replacement product without me ever asking.  Like I said I've always been SUPER happy with their products and I will continue to buy them in the future.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.,0
2.0,They spent less than 60 seconds outside of the box they arrived in before being taped up again for return.,"April 13, 2018",Yes,"Where are all these great reviews coming from? I simply don't get it. I just received mine today. I literally took them out of the box, put them on, listened to some music, took them off, placed them back into the cardboard Amazon box then taped it tightly shut for return. They literally spent less than 60 seconds outside of the box they arrived in. All the reviews had me thinking they would somehow sound better than a $39 pair of headphones but they simply don't. They don't even sound like a $45 pair of headphones. They sound precisely like $39 headphones made in China, which is what they are...I give them 2 stars instead of one because they don't sound like they should cost even less than $39, at least not in the US, but don't sound like they should cost even a dollar more either...All of you reviewers out there, you are serious losing my trust on this one. I'll just chock it up to a case of mass hypnosis.",0
2.0,Bluetooth cutouts constantly,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"The sound quality is great up until you get constant Bluetooth cut outs. No sound at all for a second or two, at least twice a song. Very annoying. I have an iPhone X and haven’t seen the same issues with my power beats headphones. These are now my backups in case I forget those. This product is trash..I was pleasantly surprised to find they shipped me a new headset, which was actually a completely different model. It has the exact same issues and is less comfortable. I still appreciate their effort, but I will never be a customer again.",1
4.0,Rediscovering music with this,"December 13, 2017",Yes,These are pretty solid. The battery life is outstanding. Don't think I've recharged mine in two weeks. I only listen to music on my commute to work and traveling in the city so that amounts to maybe 2 hours a day total which is fairly impressive battery life. The sound quality is better than I thought it'd be. I link it up to my iphone and the only problem I've had is sometimes when I put my phone in my pocket it starts cutting out so the bluetooth connectivity is a tad bit weak. This doesn't happen frequently enough for me to dislike the product but can be annoying when it does happen.,0
3.0,If only they didn't scream at you...,"June 28, 2017",Yes,"The sound quality is pretty good. I do find them to be too heavy such that the top part presses onto my head after extended wear giving me a headache. But to be fair, I am studying for the bar and end up wearing them for hours. The bluetooth is very useful in that it allows us psychotic law students to run around the room/backyard without missing a beat.  One major issue I have is how loud the ""power off"" and ""phone is disconnected"" notifications are. Sometimes I fall asleep listening to something soothing on youtube and the screaming ""POWER OFF"" jerks me right out of sleep like a mean slap on the face. I swear if I don't start taking them off before I fall asleep I will start stuttering or develop a nervous twitch. There is just no need for your headphones to yell at you that they will turn off !!!",7
5.0,These are awesome,"April 29, 2017",Yes,Absolutely love these headphones. They fit perfectly. They do not press on my ears and cause them to become sore like others I have used. They are an excellent quality too. They fold up nicely. They are just perfect and I would Highly recommend to anybody. So glad I purchased these bluetooth headphones.,2
5.0,Mic not compatible With PS4,"December 26, 2017",Yes,No complaints about the headset itself but We could not use for intended purpose. The mic does not work when plugged into PS4 remote and PS4 doesn't recognize the Bluetooth feature so these could not be used for gaming with PS4.,4
5.0,I absolutely love these headphones!,"October 12, 2017",Yes,"These are really nice headphones for the price,east Bluetooth set up and very good sound,I'm very happy with these!.These  work perfectly with both my kindle fire tablet and my fire tv. I can listen to music,audio books or movies on firestick. These Bluetooth headphones are nice quality,good sound for the price...but best part,they are comfortable!.I do not like anything ""in"" my ears,so these headphone work best for me..I also use them for my  mp3 player and via Bluetooth on my cell phone.",0
4.0,Updated Review: Replacement works like a charm and is comfortable. Great value for the money,"March 11, 2018",Yes,"Update 4/15/2018: The seller/manufacturer sent me a replacement to try it out again. So I am updating my review to reflect that...1) Build quality: 5/5. For the price, I don't think you can find a better one out there. Its sturdy and doesn't look cheap. The updated headphones have better button quality and then the previous ones and I feel little more confident...2)Comfort: 5/5. The new ones are lot more comfortable and didn't require any break-in. My head is little smaller than my wife and they are little tight for her. So YMMV. Also, I mentioned earlier, if your ears are on the bigger side, then this might be on-ear instead of around-ear for you. They are perfect for me as my ears are on smaller side...3) Sound quality: 4/5. I think they serve the purpose for me. I was not expecting Bose or Sennheiser HD level quality but the sound is crisp (and may be a tad louder). Lot of people are complaining about bass etc but I think you can adjust that from your phone or computer. As long as you don't expect a $300 sound from a $35 headphone you will not be disappointed. Few people in my office have the same headphones for couple of months long, and they seem to happy about it...4) Charging: 5/5. Takes about couple of hours to charge but once charged, it holds the charge for a decent time. I am not a power user and have yet to recharge the headphones (after 2 days of use)but even if serves me 3 days without charging, I am good. The downside is the built-in battery. Once that starts goind bad, then this headphone would outlive its utility value. How long will it take? Thats any one's guess. For $35, if this lasts me a year, I will be happy...5 Customer Service: 5/5. The customer service from the seller has been fantastic. They didn't have to send a replacement, that too free of charge just to change my experience. I definitely appreciate good service when I get it, and this has been a revelation. I am not sure if there are many companies offering this level of service for a $35 product. I think just based on that, I would recommend giving this headphone a chance...I am leaving my previous review for reference. So my change in rating would make sense...===============================.OLDER REVIEW:.===============================.I should have done some research before ordering the headphones. For sake of clarity, I will post a detailed review...1) Build quality - Build quality for the price is pretty good. They feel sturdy in your hand. Fit and finish is top-notch. The power/volume buttons do appear flimsy though. So not sure how they will withstand the test of time. My guess is - these will be the first one to go bad...2) Comfort - Looks like they do require some level of break-in. When I put them on my head directly from the box, they felt a bit tight. However, after few uses, they have loosened up a bit.  I have Bose QC25(wired) and they are extremely comfortable. I also own a cheap Panasonic RP-HTX7(wired) which are pretty good for everyday use(Surprisingly, the price for them have gone up since I bought them) This headphone is still tighter than those two (although both are wired and this one is wireless. I doubt that would be make any difference). I also bought Pioneer bluetooth phones and they were more bulky but just as tight. However, one big issue with this heaphones is that ear opening is bit narrow. The memory foam padding is pretty good and provides a good seal around your ear. My ears are on the smaller side and they fit just about right. If your ears are on the bigger side, then this might be on-ear instead of around-ear for you...3) Sound quality (Wired)- Pretty much what you would expect for the price. Surprisingly good bass response because the phones sit relatively tight around ears. Much better than Pioneer headphones (which are more than double the price). Tonality is flat but I do not expect much at this price. For casual office/home use , this would work fine. I have a bluetooth speaker in my office which I use when no one is around, but I wanted something that I can use in office hours. This would serve that purpose. They are still not as good as Panasonic RP-HTX7 (which I bought for $30 but now for some reason are double the price). Couldn't test sound quality in wireless mode. See below...4) Charging - This is where things start going down hill. The phones will not charge. When I first connected headphones to USB, the charging light turned on. I left it overnight to charge but when I checked in the morning they would not turn on. I connected again and again the charging light came on. I waited for few minutes and the light went off. I thought the charging was complete but phones still would not turn on. I figured my cable might be defective so I used the same cable to connect to a wall-port charger. There was marginal improvement. While connected to wall-charger the light came on and you could turn on the headphones but again the light went off in few minutes , which according to manual implies charging is complete. I tried turning them on - again no dice. At this point, I am quite frustrated and they are going back...The sole reason to get this headphone was to have the wireless mode. The fact that they do not hold charge or battery is defective is a bummer and a deal breaker. I should have done my research before ordering them. There are 12k reviews but most reviews are from people who have just 1 review which is this product. Take them with a pinch of salt. I would say stay away. There are other reviewers who have commented on charging issues and I would say those are the ones you should pay attention to.",4
3.0,Acceptable,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"The pictures are photoshopped. The pink does not have a metallic finish like that. It's shiny, but just regular shiny plastic. Uncomfortable when worn with glasses. Bluetooth quality is terrible, sounds like a radio station partially out of range from two feet away. Works okay with the wire but not the greatest.",1
4.0,"Great blocking sound from outside, not so much the other way around.","April 19, 2017",Yes,"The sound is great on these things.  Blocking out the surrounding sound is amazing too.  I deducted a star because while they block outside noise from coming in, my music is loud and clear for everybody else to hear, even at at low volume.  Not for good use at work in anoffice, but great for everything else.",2
5.0,Best so Far !!!,"November 30, 2018",Yes,I have dropped these  headphones on the floor several times and they still keep working !!  I have had these for a couple of years and they have survived me! Just recently I dropped them. And the button on the side broke off and they STILL WORK!! The problem is at the gym they fall of my head.. so as they get older they get looser. FYI ;) love these headphones!,1
4.0,Enjoying so far - not for use on airplanes if you want true noise cancellation,"November 12, 2017",Yes,"Good for exercising and wearing for a while. I bought hoping the noise cancellation would work for flights.  It's not enough to cover all the sounds in the cabin.  It dampens them, but depending on where you are on the plane, you may need something else.  On one plane, these were great.  On the next, smaller plane, I had to go to my earbuds to hear well...Pairs easily.  Only thing I would consider for next time is getting ear muffs that can rotate so they lay flat on my throat when not on my ears.",0
4.0,Good quality for a incredible price!,"August 15, 2018",Yes,"This wireless headset is awesome! I love the design and simplicity of it, the controls by the headset is a little different, but I believe I can get used to. I've not tested in the GYM yet for durability, however, I believe I won't be disappoint. I have own a wired Republic Headset and it was great until started not working anymore. I don't believe the Hype so I never really got into the ""Beat by Dre"" headset, it is just too pricy!!! (sorry Dre. Love you still). Good price for good quality can't beat it!",0
5.0,"Best you'll get for &lt;$120, I would bet on that.","January 15, 2018",Yes,"My bf and his friends said these would be garbage - not at all the case. Music sounds great, I can't hear anyone with them on (and music playing, but doesn't have to be loud), pretty comfortable. I have small ears, and I haven't quite found optimal comfort yet, sometimes the top of my head or back of my ears get a little irritated, but this is my first time using over-ear headphones for anything. No issues with the mic...Can't speak for wireless though, my computer doesn't have bluetooth (yet) so I have to plug these in.",0
4.0,My First Bluetooth gadget.....and I like it!!!!,"November 19, 2017",Yes,"These are really nice headphones.  I saw a youtube review about these headphones and decided to give them a try.  They paired with my phone (Galaxy S8) with NO PROBLEM.  If you wear these when you workout they will feel warm around the ear, but that didn't bother me.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  Charge lasts a good amount of time as well.",1
5.0,Great Price and Great Headphones,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"I did lots of research prior to buying these headphones, and I was super skeptical, even with the great reviews..Ultimately, I am SUPER happy with these headphones. These headphone are super comfortable  and have a long battery life..The sound is fantastic and great for listening to music or just watching tv. The earpads are soft and don't hurt your ears, even after hours of wearing them. The headphones are also adjustable and great at reducing noise..The overall quality is great and worth the price!",1
4.0,Sound leakage,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE: I just got an email saying they are sending me a new one since mine didn't satisfy my expectations. I am updating my review from 2 stars to 4 stars for great customer service. I will update my review again after I try new headphones...What is the point of putting on headphones if everyone else near you will also hear what you are listening to? This ""headphones"" leaks so much sound that I don't need put them on to listen to music anymore. I can just leave them on the table and I will still hear the music loud and clear. I bought this because it has got so many nice reviews. I thought it was cheap and effective, but I was wrong. This product doesn't even deserve that cheap price tag, because I am not going to use it. I just tossed it away as it is not useful to me at all.",0
4.0,Pretty good!,"March 18, 2018",Yes,"These are pretty good for the price! I'm not terribly fond of bass heavy headphones, but if you're into that, it's definitely worth it! The fact that you can easily switch between wired and Bluetooth with these is really nice, and the battery life is pretty solid! There earpieces are nice and comfy, though I do wish I could extend the headband a bit further. That being said, it's still big enough to fit my unfortunately large head...I originally bought a pair of these about a year ago, and had a good enough time with them but they unfortunately broke after a good few months. The seller was kind enough to send me a replacement free of charge, so many thanks to MPOW and Patozon for that!..All in all, if you're in the market for budget headphones, you like a heavy bass, and you want the option to listen wirelessly, this is a pretty solid deal!",0
5.0,I listed pretty regularly and probably only charge them ever 5-7 days,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"These headphones last for FOREVER. I listed pretty regularly and probably only charge them ever 5-7 days. They have also been awesome for letting my 4 year old talk on the phone while not letting him carry my 1000 dollar iphone around. Plus, he seems to be able to hear and communicate better than when he is trying to hold the phone to his ear. The sound quality is really great, and they are so comfortable. I haven't had any problems with the bluetooth range either. I originally bought them as gaming headphones, but I use them constantly. I also bought a second set for my 8 year old because I liked them so much",0
2.0,No bass at all,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"I got these because of the price and the great reviews..The pros: EXTREMELY comfortable! So much more comfortable than my other pair of cheaper Bluetooth headphones. The part over the ear is big enough that it's comfortable even with earrings...Cons: No bass. I kept increasing the volume, but the sound quality is very cheap. I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones that cost me $20 that recently broke, but they had much more bass than these. That is why I returned them.",1
2.0,Microphone Audio Quality Is Terrible,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"<div class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block"" id=""video-block-R11V9IIJLUKTJM""></div><input class=""video-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A15fg+lubTS.mp4""/><input class=""video-slate-img-url"" name="""" type=""hidden"" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71HBNi-PD8S.png""/> The sound quality of the headphones is alright, Ive heard better but it's not bad. It seems to be fairly well constructed, and I like that they fold up. I probably would have given it 3 or maybe 4 stars but I specifically bought it to use with Skype on my computer and the microphone is terrible. The volume isn't the problem, it's the audio quality. It sounds like your talking through a tin can covered up by a pillow. I didn't expect it to be as good as my wired USB headset, but I figured it would at least be usable. I feel like if I used this to make calls half of what I was saying wouldn't be understood. I'll be returning it as soon as possible.",0
5.0,"Great for a noisy office, much better quality than I expected. May be a great budget solution for TV audio.","November 30, 2017",Yes,"I was not expecting much for a sub $40 pair of headphones, but they arrived with smooth metal band that looks pretty high quality. The soft padded ear cups do a great job muffling sounds from people in the office. The also work well for a guy with glasses. The audio is great for YouTube and Netflix but may not work well for music, but the funny bit of compression or flatness may be the Bluetooth from my laptop.  I listen for a few hours a day and have never run out of battery.  I am very happy with the purchase.  Now I am looking at one of the Mpow Bluetooth adapters if I can find one that works via 5.1 optical from my HDTV.",1
3.0,Pretty good/function but some annoying features,"June 27, 2018",Yes,"These headphones sound pretty good and are decently comfortable, but do start to cause some aching around my ears after about an hour or so. My main issue with them is the unnecessary sound effects. When the battery is dying for instance, the headphones will beep every 20 seconds or so just to let you know, effectively rendering them too annoying to use any longer until you recharge them. There is also a lady who interrupts whatever you're listening when adjusting the volume to tell you when its reached the max, I don't need this confirmation... Beyond that I'd say the controls are generally clunky and a bit annoying but for the price they are still pretty good and easy to use. Just remember you get what you pay for.",0
4.0,on sale these are a steal..  Had to get the red  but.. THEY WORK . will buy a back up pair when on sale,"August 7, 2018",Yes,very comfortable.. the verbal voice feedback  when turned on  is great.. touch switches seem to work fine.  I am using to hear tv.. had no trouble with blue tooth connection...  stays connected when turned off...  Have only had them a few hours but they are COMFORTABLE.. snug on my head..  and they work...  HAVE NOT TRIED WITH CELL PHONE....I purchased a cheaper headphone and returned it when these went on sale.  THE CHEAPER ones had a horrible volume switch that did not consistently work.... and did not fit firmly on my head and the ear pieces were not as comfortable.. I will purchase another  when it goes back on sale.. for use when traveling...,0
5.0,The headphones work just fine. My problem is that I wanted to pair ...,"August 4, 2017",Yes,"The headphones work just fine.  My problem is that I wanted to pair two sets of headphones to our Samsung TV but it takes another little box to connect to the TV to do this.  It turns out my Samsung TV doesn't have an output receptacle for such a device so we can only connect one headphone to it.  If you plan on connecting two of these headphones, be sure you're TV can handle the connector box.",1
5.0,Great over-ear headphones for the price!,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"Holds a charge for days. Comfortable to wear. Easily pairs to different devices. Range from BT source is more than adequate. At first, the sound seemed kind of 'distant', but after using heavily, I adjusted to it (I've only paired it to my phone and an iPad, so there are no adjustments to bass, mids, treble anyway). They aren't noise cancelling, but if you're listening to something, you don't hear anything else. Controls on headphones are easy to adapt to. Durability seems good for use in a home/office environment. The only drawback - no wall charger is included. They recommend that you only charge from a USB port at no more than 5 watts. But I plugged them in to my laptop while I went to a couple meetings at work and they were fully charged when I returned. Since they hold a charge for so long, I don't feel that it's a big deal, or worthy of removing a star. Great over-ear headphones for the price!",0
5.0,I think these are a great pair of headphones,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"I think these are a great pair of headphones. I like the sound quality, the battery life, and I am glad it has an option for connecting to your device using a regular aux cable when your battery dies. I previously had a pair of on ear headphones and I can say that I definitely prefer over the ear headphones. One issue I had with another pair of headphones was that the low battery warning was really loud, so loud it would scare me when I was listening to music and made me hate that pair of headphones. This set had a low battery warning, but it is just a annoying beeping that is not extremely loud, annoying but it does not make me want to throw the headphones away. When turning on the headphones the ""power on"" notification sound is pretty loud, but I just wait to put the phones on my head for a second and it is fine...The only drawback with these headphones was that it did not come with a charger. It came with a usb to micro usb cable, but no adapter. I didn't have a problem though because I have a lot of these adapters from other devices, so I gave it 5 stars.",0
3.0,Good but Tight on ears.,"September 9, 2017",Yes,"Good So far. Jst received it. I find it bit tight on my face, but i think I will get used to it. Voice quality is great. Packagin is ok, but I guess that hows they keeping the cost low. Overall I am happy. Go for it, there is nothing to loose...Updated: I think I will return this. After working with it for couple of hours, I am finding it very tight n uncomfortable. I have tried other headphones, they are much softer on ears. If u r used to tight ones, then go for it or look for somethin else.",1
5.0,The quality is great for the price,"June 26, 2017",Yes,"Bought these headphones for my 11 year old for his birthday. The quality is great for the price. They are easy to use, comfortable, and he loves the colors. The Bluetooth paired easily with his tablet and phone, and he was overjoyed that he can listen to music in the house w/o having to carry his phone around. As parents, we love that his use of the headphones means our music in the car isn't competing with his anymore. Totally worth the money. It's a win/win.",3
2.0,"Not ""Over Ear"" for me.","November 17, 2017",Yes,"Advertized as ""Over Ear"" but certainly weren't for me. And, based on not fitting properly, they didn't sound that good. They got returned. Your mileage my vary but. I'm a 7 3/4 hat size and these just made it to my ears and, though they did make it to them, the cups aren't really big enough for ""over the ear"" for me.",1
2.0,A let-down,"July 18, 2018",Yes,"This is my first product review, and it's not for a good reason. Immediately after testing out the headphones, I could tell that the audio quality was mediocre and muffled. Thinking that the blue-tooth connection had something to do with it, I tested the unit again with the including 3.5mm audio jack cord with the same results...The audio quality is something you would expect to find at your local public library; even the stock Apple earpods sound better. I've had better sounding head-phones at a lesser price-range than this product...Aesthetically they look fine, build-quality is acceptable (beware the side button is mushy), I did find that there was a lot of noise leak, but the cups are very comfortable...Will return and purchase something else.",0
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"The sound quality is absolutely HORRID!!!!!.it sounded like you put cotton in your ear before putting the headphones on.It's not even just the volume, you can have it loud but still be very off balance and quiet...also all the reviews for 5 stars are fake. all of the different listings of the same product has the same amount of reviews and same amount of stars.",0
5.0,Nice set of Bluetooth headphones,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"Nice set of Bluetooth headphones. Have a nice sound and they connected easy to several devices. Easy to adjust the volume or skip tracks right from the headphones. The range seems typical for bluetooth (roughly 30 feet). Very comfortable to wear and charge seems to last the 10-15 hours (3-4 hr charge time.) Have not tried them corded as yet but nice to have that option. They fold nicely in the included cloth bag too. Basically, very happy with purchase and may very well need another pair for the wife.",0
5.0,The audio on these things are amazing for the price and have no complaints on these,"December 15, 2017",Yes,"I bought two of these and they were legit. The audio on these things are amazing for the price and have no complaints on these. Sure they’re not officially noise cancelling but they work damn near as good for the price. Worth every penny if not more. I wear the with my hat or glasses. And yes they work with computers, phones except for I believe gaming systems.",1
5.0,I went to CNET but wasn't pleased with the options they offered,"June 16, 2017",Yes,"I read the reviews before purchasing this product and must admit I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought about ordering the beats by Dre but couldn't justify the price point. So I started doing research to see what else was out there. I went to CNET but wasn't pleased with the options they offered. The more I read the reviews, the more I realized what would be important to me. I soon realized that I wouldn't be happy with an on ear experience so I narrowed my search to over the ear. After scrolling and scrolling, my search took me to this wierd name which made me more nervous. But then most of the reviews I read were positive. Everyone loved them so I ordered on that alone and now I am writing my own review because this wierd name product is absolutely GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! They sound great they feel great and they are practical for what I needed. Great product. Look no further. This is what you need.",1
2.0,Decent Headphones but Really Uncomfortable,"September 11, 2017",Yes,"These are definitely budget headphones so you can't expect much.  Most of the qualities were OK; they connect to bluetooth easily, the battery life is good, and they sound decent.  The real deal breaker though is how uncomfortable they are.  After wearing them for only a few minutes my head starts killing me.  We're not just talking a little unease but a really painful feeling.  The earcups are OK but aren't super comfy either.  All of the qualities of these headphones are meaningless to me since I can't wear them without getting a throbbing headache.",0
5.0,Love these headphones! Cute and functional!,"March 7, 2018",Yes,"I bought these because I hate earbud type headphones and wanted Bluetooth headphones to work out with. So far I love these. They connected just fine with my iPhone. They have a good seal around my ear and they are fairly comfortable on my head when working out. The sound quality of my music is just fine and no one else around me can hear my music. I did call my daughter in the loud gym while on these headphones. She was able to hear me just fine and I could hear her. There's always that problem of speaking too loudly while on the phone wearing headphones so I probably won't use them for that very often. But wanted to note that they work great to talk on the phone, too. All in all, I think they were a good value for the price! Plus the color is pretty! My kids do make fun of me a bit because these things are not small. You'll be wearing a big ole pair of headphones on your head. But the color, comfort and quality is worth it.",0
4.0,Great for their price!,"June 13, 2018",Yes,"I needed these headphones for running outside &amp; working out/doing yoga and for listening to lectures online, and they're great for all of these things. Battery lasts for a really long time. They also look nice/sleek. After a little while though they do feel a little bit uncomfortable on the ears but that's not really a big issue for me. They do have passive noise cancelling, I just wish the clarity of the sound was a little better especially when making phone calls, usually people tell me they can't hear me (unless I speak really loudly.) Overall I recommend! I mean for their price it's definitely worth it! the best part is that they connect so quickly back and forth from my phone to my laptop. Thanks!",0
5.0,Great Buy!,"October 22, 2017",Yes,"Was looking for wireless headphones to use while I workout (treadmill, bike, &amp; elliptical) as I don't care for earbuds. These were the right price and reviews were good so I went for it. So far I love them, they were easy to pair to my phone, comfortable over my ears and snug enough to prevent falling off while I exercise. They also come in different colors. I didn't purchase these to use while on the phone,however, they work great for that also. You can hear clearly and orhers can hear you clearly as well. Overall I am very happy with this buy.",0
5.0,The earphones are good quality and perfect for my nursing audio lectures,"December 17, 2017",Yes,The earphones are good quality and perfect for my nursing audio lectures. I will recommend to my nursing colleagues who are studying.  The ear phones have enough cushion and sound quality is good.  I would like to purchase another one in a different color.  I use it with my iPhone with perfect blue tooth connection. I would purchase again.,1
4.0,"No Charge, had to return","February 28, 2018",Yes,"Unfortunately, the product wasn't great. It wouldn't hold a charge for me, despite being plugged in all day. The sound was fine when it worked, which was rare. That being said, the sellers were great at returns and were good to work with...UPDATE: I was sent a new pair by the seller to try again. This time around, the product worked much better. It held a battery pretty well. The noise-cancellation isn't great, but was still effective on the airplane.",1
5.0,"Works great, sounds great!","December 21, 2017",Yes,"Just tried this last night for first time, im new to blue tooth and even cell phones. Fits over ear nicely blocks out a good amount of out side sound passively. Sound quality seemed quite good. I paired it up to my cell phone the process was pretty fast and easy. I made a call and was able to walk and talk hands free, this is great. I don't know where the mic is located but the person i was talking to herd me just fine while walking in a light wind even. Im writing this after one use that's how satisfied i am with them, hopefully they last.",0
5.0,Awesome headphones for the price level.,"September 17, 2017",Yes,"Really nice headphones for the price I paid. ( got them on a significant discount thanks to amazon prime, and have already recommended them to 2 friends..It's been a couple weeks since I received them and gave them their initial 100% charge. Since then, I have used them every day, walking one place or another (work, school, etc) and have STILL not had to recharge yet. The sound is about what you'd expect for a wireless set. Not perfect, but not horrible. And they get very loud, which is nice for when I walk past construction, or just want to use them as small speakers  when I'm with my friends..My only complaint is that when I make calls, the people on the other end seem to usually report a subtle but annoying screech coming through. This only happens when connected to this set via bluetooth, absent when using the aux cord, and I have yet to confirm what factors affect this or cause it..I can see why this is a popular product and has the rating it does.",0
5.0,"Great value, comfort, battery life, and sound quality","March 3, 2018",Yes,"Absolutely love these! They are incredibly comfortable, the battery lasts a very long time, and they cancel out a lot of background noise. I am currently a physician assistant student, so if you know anything about PA school, you can understand that I sit and listen to HOURS of lectures every day and then go home and listen to more lectures for HOURS. I have used these since receiving them a week ago, and have yet to have to recharge them. I love that these are blue tooth so I'm not locked to my laptop, and that you can play/pause, skip and adjust volume from the headphones. My favorite thing about these, however, are the value; I would probably pay twice the amount I paid for this quality of headphones.",0
4.0,"Not bad at all, and at $40, even more impressive to me..","January 29, 2018",Yes,"Great earphones at this price range. Comfortable-can wear these for hours on end with no pressure points anywhere. Bass is a little too heavy (I understand this is what's popular now)..just for me, I don't listen to music with any bass and it's a bit too much during movies or youtube videos where bass is not needed..All in all, I can't give these a 5, they're simply not at that level. I actually give them about a 3.5 overall but again, at $40 the price for me for what these are (pretty good) bumps them to a solid 4. Get these, you probably won't be disappointed.",0
4.0,Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Short Fast Review,"August 22, 2017",Yes,"Nice headphones, easy pairing,  good sound, for those looking for strong bass these are not for you.  Would be nice if theses had a fast/turbo charger. The controls are functional but it is had to know what you are touching.  Some ridges/raised tactile indicators to separate the functions buttons locations would have been nice. The mic is clear and functions well.",1
3.0,"Cheaply made, you can hear the sound from outside. Wouldnt buy again. Ok product.","May 25, 2018",Yes,"The sound is pretty good, except you can hear literally every sound from the outside, even on a not so loud volume. The top part, the cushion that touches your head, is super cheap. The fabric part that covers the cushion (grey) is practically falling/peeling off and I havent even had these headphones for a year yet. Very cheaply made. Also, the middle button, the pause and play, has fallen off twice now!!  Its easy to put back on but it feels wobbly on the headphone. Im very disappointed but idky i am because they were chesp for headphones.",0
4.0,build quality way better than the sound quality. recommend H2 model.,"July 18, 2018",Yes,"like the build quality and comfort to wear but the sound is not enjoyable. I have no idea why so many good views. Amazon should look into those fake reviews to keep up our faith...Update on Aug 08,2018.Got another MPOW H2 from this company, way way better sound quality. I RECOMMEND MPOW H2.  BUT I STILL DO NOT RECOMMEND  THIS 059 MODEL. change my review from  2 star  to 4 star for their customer service.",0
5.0,Fantastic headphones!!!,"July 23, 2017",Yes,Got them for tv headphones for my hard of hearing grandfather. Had em for about a month and love them!! He wears them all night as he doesn't sleep much and they last 10 hrs easily. He says they're super comfortable and can easily hear the tv and dialogues when wearing them. We love that they were super easy to sync with the blue tooth transmitter that we got to use with these and we can finally sleep without being woken by the blaring tv. Can't reccomend them enough!,1
2.0,They are comfortable and deliver good sound quality,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my husband as he likes to listen to things on his iPhone while I’m watching something on TV. They are comfortable and deliver good sound quality. HOWEVER, even at a low volume, I could hear the song he was listening to, lyrics and all. At a higher volume, there was no point in wearing them as I could hear it as if the headphones weren’t even on his ears! And I was sitting several feet away! If you’re on your own, this wouldn’t be an issue but if you plan to use them in the company of others, these are not the right headphones for you!",1
5.0,"By far the best pair of headphones for the price in it's class. Not too bassy, not too bright, just perfectly tuned. Those&gt;Beats","July 26, 2018",Yes,"I'll keep this short and sweet...About to order a second pair because they are $30 some dollars and they sound/feel better than the $2-- Dr. Beats that sell like crazy..It's a crime but I'm glad people are giving these companies a shot because a lot of them make a better product for a 1/8th of the cost...It's crazy... Anyways, I love love love these headphones, so comfy, the pads are amazing, battery life is great, and Bluetooth sync's right away.",0
5.0,"Great, affordable headphones","September 30, 2017",Yes,These Bluetooth-enabled headphones are great. The controls are intuitive. The cushioned ear cuffs are comfortable. The sound quality is very good. I have used these to listen to music (paired with my Android phone) while stepping on the elliptical and to listen to online lectures (paired with Lenovo laptop)...I am very pleased with my purchase.,1
5.0,"Ease of use, great price!","March 20, 2018",Yes,"Very nice for the price! Although not the absolute BEST audio quality I've ever had, these are very good. I give it five stars for the shear ease of use they have created with these. Rather than annoying beep signals that so many accessories seem to go with, they have incorporated a nice British lady who tells you what devices you have synced with, the volume level, and on off. Love it! The mic works great for phone calls as well, have had no problems. Very solidly constructed as well, and they fit over my big ears.",0
5.0,Replacement is great!,"March 27, 2018",Yes,Updated review!..On the original purchase the maximum volume was too low for me. I was having trouble hearing podcasts and audiobooks when there was street noise or noise from riding a train. The seller contacted me and sent me a replacement and the problem is SOLVED! Yes! The newer version of these has a MUCH higher maximum volume. I haven't had them long enough to comment about the battery life but so far so good! Thanks for resolving the issue!,0
3.0,Don’t have that deep punch bass.,"March 25, 2018",Yes,"lets get something straight, these don’t even come close to the sounds quality of say a pair of beats or higher end headphones. But for the price they hold their ground..If heart pounding bass is your thing, keep looking..They do a better job of playing mid and high frequencies...They are comfortable and look nice. They do a good job of blocking ambient noise...The Bluetooth connected effortlessly and works as expected.",0
4.0,Great Quality For The Price,"October 26, 2017",Yes,"Really great headphones for the price! I had a pair of $60 headphones &amp; I honestly prefer these. They were specifically bass heavy headphones but ended up being muffly sounding so I bought these instead &amp; I can honestly say that the Mpow headphones are better overall, they are very crisp and clear BUT they do not have heavy bass at all. I listen to a lot of bass heavy dubstep &amp; these headphones do not have strong bass in my opinion whatsoever. But on a plus note, as I said, the sound is very crisp &amp; clear &amp; the volume does get decently loud. If your phone/device is at full volume the headphones can still go louder which is great. Kind of wish it had a hard case instead of the sack but that’s not really a big deal. Super comfortable on your head, super soft pads! Also, these headphones are super simple to operate &amp; connect to devices. I would recommend these for sure!",32
4.0,Sound quality = ok Comfort = great Bluetooth = good,"September 20, 2017",Yes,Sound quality = ok.Comfort = great.Bluetooth = good. Don't plan on using the too far from phone; for gear vr..Noise cancelling = none. Also others can hear every bit of what you're listening and makes it seem like you have the volume up pretty high..Price = excellent..I can't complain about the sound quality with the low cost. So I give these things a 4 star.,1
4.0,"dead after 6 months, replaced for free","November 6, 2018",Yes,"These worked pretty well until one day they refused to charge. They would turn on when connected to power but die immediately when unplugged. The construction is such that, taking them apart to fix them would crack the shell...That said, after posting this review, Mpow got in contact with me and sent me a new set. The warranty covers factory defect for 18 months. Pretty happy about that.",0
5.0,Very fine Headphones and an excellent value,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"I have had these headphones for only a few days, but my initial impressions are very positive. They are easy to use and the sound range seems very good, but I'm not an audiophile.  They have been quite comfortable to wear for for several hours at a time.  I haven't yet tested how long they work on a single charge.  I have been recharging them after two or three hours. Bottom line for me is that I'm quite pleased with this purchase and consider it to be an excellent value overall.",0
5.0,Seems of quality,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"These seem to be good quality headphones. My first thought when unboxing then was “wow these feel like good quality!” After I waited anxiously for them to charge, I paired them to my phone and turned on the tunes. My volume was only halfway up and I could no longer hear the endless adventures of the little einsteins, which my three year old watches on repeat. So that is a huge plus. The only thing I’ve found weird is that it comes with a hanging cable but not the usb wall outlet. Minor setback though! They are really comfortable too!",0
1.0,the only main multifunction buttom broke fast and it never pairs with my laptop or phone! What a waste of money!,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"This is not worth it, it never works, to pair with my laptop is a process, after many times if I have lucky that day, it will pair. If not, forget it. I buy it 2 months ago, I barely use it and now the only bottom that has is broken!! nothing works because the multifunction button to turn on of, volume up and down and Bluetooth doesn't work!!! I really want my money back... if I would buy this in a store, I will have a refund or an exchange... this is the huge problem with online orders with third-party sellers...  the only main multifunction buttom broke fast and it never pairs with my laptop or phone! What a waste of money!",0
4.0,"Great value, comfortable","November 16, 2017",Yes,"Great value, comfortable, good sound.  I've tried a number of mid to low price bluetooth over-ear headphones and what immediately distinguishes these to me is clear treble and mid (lyrics, dialog).  The others I've tried around or less than $100 are always muffled in this department.  For my purposes, mostly tv and phone use, I'm considering buying another pair for the office.  In initial testing I am listening to spotify playlists and they perform quite well there too, enjoyably.  They won't be replacing my wired Bose True Sound for extended music listening but still, perfectly respectable.",0
5.0,Very impressed with these headphones.,"December 10, 2017",Yes,"These headphones look expensive, they have a beautiful design. I love how comfortable they are. The Bluetooth works flawlessly. At this price point, they're unrivaled. Don't expect the sound quality to be on the same level as Bose or Beats but hey, these are a fraction of the cost...*** Amazing Customer Service ***",1
5.0,"Great value, super comfortable, pretty pink!","January 9, 2018",Yes,"I love having the option of bluetooth and plugging them in. I didn't want entirely bluetooth and there aren't many headphones that aren't nowadays! The cord is not too long either, so they don't get tangled up in everything. I haven't had any issues with these yet...These are super comfortable and wrap around my ears and don't hurt at all, nor do they get hot and uncomfortable..I love the color and they are sleek and pretty. Gotta go with the pink! Any of the colors looked great though...Great value, couldn't beat the price!",0
3.0,a little tight,"July 6, 2017",Yes,"The headphones sound fine. Plenty of range and plenty of depth. They are a bit tight and earpads are kind of small. I usually have to carefully tuck my ears into the ear pad so it doesn't rest on my ear which is quickly painful. I don't exactly have a physically big head or big ears so I think this warrants a 2 star dock. Like I said, they sound good and gave decent range when connected to my phone.",1
5.0,Five Stars,"September 7, 2017",Yes,"These are awesome. Great sound, range and battery life for an excellent  price...Update: I have used these headphones 8 hours every weekday for about a year. They are showing some superficial wear but battery life is still strong and they still sound great. I am not sure how you could justify a b*se pair with these being the great value they have proven to be.",1
1.0,Started malfunctioning 15 days after purchase,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"I had such high hopes for these headphones. I wanted to enjoy this purchase. And, at first I loved these headphones. The sound quality was a dramatic improvement over what I was using before. However, love quickly began turning to hate only 15 days later when the unit started malfunctioning (suddenly stopping and silently resetting to the first song on my mp3 player). So, no matter how many songs I listen to, I have to skip back (multiple times) from the first song until I get back to the one I was originally listening to. It’s frustrating and takes away from the overall enjoyment of the unit. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.",0
3.0,"Bluetooth headphones 3/5, wired headphones 3.5/5, voip 1/5.","July 12, 2017",Yes,Sound is mediocre. They sound a bit better than a 12 dollar pair of wired on ear headphones I bought from amazon. This model sounds noticeably better wired than on bluetooth. I think I'll keep them but they barely end up on that side of the fence. The sound quality just lacks the separation and clarity I was hoping for.  I would love to find an affordable bluetooth headset that comes close to the sound quality of my jbl charge 2 bluetooth speaker. The call quality is horrible on this headset as well. Sounds like 32k connection.,1
4.0,Great wireless headphones,"September 26, 2017",Yes,They are very comfortable and easy to store. Even comes with small pouch. Bluetooth works great and charge holds for days. It comes with an audio cable so if battery is discharged or bluetooth is not working you can plug it in the old way. They don't feel super tight so that may be a good thing for some people or a bad thing to others. But price-quality is good.,1
5.0,"Comfortable, great sound and foldable!","January 17, 2018",Yes,"Love these headphones.  Love that they fold, that they connect easily, the sound is great and they're comfortable.  One of the things I didn't like about other bluetooth headphones is that when I was listening to a podcast and people stopped talking for a moment, the headphones would, for some reason, not stay connected properly.  When the talking resumed, they would reconnect but would cut off the first few words, as if they were voice-activated.  It was very annoying.  But not with these!  They stay connected even through a bit of silence.  Really great purchase and easy to figure out the buttons.",0
2.0,Uncomfortable with glasses,"November 10, 2017",Yes,Works great but ear muffs are uncomfortable when wearing glasses. If they were a little softer or didn't squeeze so hard it would be better. I originally rated them 3 stars but reduced it to 2 stars to reflect the fact that customer service never followed up on their promise to send me a different pair that would be more comfortable.,1
4.0,The headphone are exactly as expected. It has both ...,"April 29, 2017",Yes,"The headphone are exactly as expected.  It has both Wireless and Wired Versions.  We had a similar version that we were replacing as the expansion joint cracked after repeated use.  We expect that this will do the same over time...however, they were used daily for over 16 months.  At this price, it makes it worth while to get them replaced.",2
4.0,Great but not totally soundproof,"October 8, 2018",Yes,"+: The sound quality on these headphones is great, I used them at the gym with little to no problems while working out. They're sturdy and comfortable to wear at work.-: I get a lot of complaints about call quality when I answer the phone while wearing them. Also, I have to use a white noise app to drown out extra noise while working..Overall, I would say they are worth the price but not perfect if you're going for full-on noise cancellation headphones.",0
5.0,Very Good Headphones!,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I'm not an electrical or sound engineer. I have never owned Beats or even heard first hand how they sound. But I really enjoy music and like for it to sound ""deep and rich"". These headphones are better than anything I have ever owned and  really quiet when it comes to outside noise.  you will not be disappointed in these headphones, for the quality/sound/price ratio.",1
4.0,Sounds great. Works great. Padded headband not so great.,"July 12, 2018",Yes,"Very easy to use. Awesome battery life. Bass felt a little boomy at first, but I don't notice it so much anymore. I mostly listen to podcasts and audiobooks, so you may want to find a reviewer who listens to more music if that's what you care about. Overall, I think the audio quality is excellent for headphones at this price. ""Foldable"" wasn't a feature that I was looking for when I made my purchase, but I've come to really appreciate the feature. When folded, the headphones fit nicely in one of the side pockets of my Timbuk2 messenger bag. My main complaint is the design and/or construction of the padded headband. The rubbery ""skin"" material started to separate from the headband just a few weeks after purchase, exposing the foam padding (see photos). I have since taped this back up with hockey stick tape (see photo). It doesn't look great, but I'm not trying to make a fashion statement with these headphones.",0
5.0,the BEST sound,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"We have several different headphones in our house. When I bought a new digital piano I tried all of them. These have the best sound, far better than others including more expensive headphones..Even if you connect them via bluetooth the sound quality is still outstanding..I like them so much I ordered another pair..My kids also use them, these are more comfortable for kids than other ones.",0
4.0,Spend a little more to get the August EP650,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"Reasonable but not my favorite. I recommend August EP650 Bluetooth Over Ear Wireless Stereo NFC 3.5mm Headphones with Rechargeable Battery, Multipoint and Built-in Microphone for Mobile Phones, iPhone, iPad, Laptops, Tablets, Smartphones. This one has round ear cups, while the August has rectangular ones I like better.",1
5.0,"Outstanding bluetooth headphones, great look too.","January 30, 2018",Yes,"Great alternative for noise cancelling headphones.  Bluetooth pairing works seamlessly and it doesn't take forever to charge up.  I haven't quite figured out how to answer phone calls through them yet, will need to read the instructions again.  While not noise cancelling per say, these do a great job muffling sound.  I wear them at work to listen to music or at the gym and rarely do I hear much other than my music.  Why spend $200 plus for headphones when these do great.",0
5.0,I love these headphones not only is the price right but ...,"June 3, 2017",Yes,"I love these headphones not only is the price right but the quality is amazing. I love the way these sound while I play my music how you came adjust the volume without touching your phone or tablet. I have been using these every chance I get and they go everywhere with me, my family tried them and they said it sounds the same as their Beats Headphones and I agree. I would recommend these to anyone who wants a great wireless headphones but not have to pay a lot for a pair. Only wish they came with a hard case instead of a bagged one but that wasn't a big deal I just bought that along with these and of course got the protection plan cause you never know what may happen down the line ...Total for all that was 55$ (Rounded to the nearest dollar) so if you want some that look cool and sound great get these!",8
3.0,The speaker and headset functions are split and if you use the sound for a headset it's horrible. It's not that comfortable either,"July 6, 2017",Yes,depending on your speaker configuration you may have to fiddle quite a bit with these. The speaker and headset functions are split and if you use the sound for a headset it's horrible...It's not that comfortable either. Ears sweat after only an hour or so..I dunno it's not good for the price i paid. I should have just spent the extra money and got a better pair.,1
5.0,I love how the completely COVER your ears!,"October 10, 2018",Yes,"I LOVE these! I bought them as my back up “gym bag” pair but ended up making them my main “use all the time” pair because they’re so comfy...they go all the way over my ears, so my ears don’t ever get sore. The pads are really soft too. Great sound quality too as far as I can tell. I’m no sound expert but they certainly are not lacking in my experience!! Definitely recommend these!",0
5.0,LOVE these headphones!,"August 24, 2018",Yes,"I've had these headphones for a week and have used them every day, and I absolutely love them! I only charged them when I first got them, and they haven't needed to be charged again since. I use them for about 6 hours a day while at work.  I chose these because they have the option of being both plugged in and Bluetooth. They are really easy to pair with Bluetooth devices. The sound quality is great for my purposes. The ear padding is very comfortable and doesn't irritate my glasses or my ears. They're very comfortable to wear all day long. The only complaint I would have is to turn them on/off, you have to hold the button down for several seconds, which is also the same button that makes calls and plays/pauses music. I wish there was a separate switch for power. Other than that, I love them! I would definitely recommend and would buy again.",0
5.0,Excellent customer service,"January 3, 2018",Yes,Most reviews really bragged these up for having good sound quality but I disagree. They have very low bass that sounds a little distorted. For the price tag they aren’t awful but I was hoping for more after reading the other reviews. They are very comfortable though and connected to my devices quickly with no issues. I just wish they weren’t so muffled...Update: Customer service from Mpow contacted me and replaced these with their Mpow H2 Bluetooth Headphones. The sound quality on the H2 headphones was much better. I like being able to switch between the equalizer settings with the touch of one button.,1
5.0,look no further-  these are the ones !,"August 27, 2017",Yes,"so far so good... these sound GREAT, bluetooth connection was a breeze,and they fold up pretty nicely for travel..i bought these and my wife bought a pair for about twice as much, all i can tell is that hers are bulkier..not sure why i would spend any more; these are comfortable - intend to use on the plane quite a bit, will update review if that doesn't go as planned",1
5.0,Believe all the reviews you read... These are good (and not just for the price),"April 17, 2018",Yes,"I bought these before an 6 hour flight because my phone's headphone jack is, well, jacked. I usually prefer in ear, but haven't found inexpensive ones that can keep noise out fairly well. They aren't noise cancelling, but i was able to turn up the volume loud enough that i couldn't hear much (and even without turning it up someone would have to extremely loud and close (i'm talking to you baby!). They performed outstanding especially for the price. I did get a little sweaty over the long flight and had to take a few breaks, but it was good. I haven't tried the corded function yet..At one point i got up and walked like 50 seats to the bathroom at the back of the place with them on and realized that I left my phone charging in my seat and they didn't drop anything.",0
1.0,Blinking blue light kills the deal,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"WARNING: once powered on, these headphones have a blinking blue light that flashes about every 6 seconds. So... at night, your spouse will hate you and everybody on the plane will become annoyed by the strobe effect.  Sound is good. Battery is good. But the blinking blue light, which can’t be turned off, is a buzzkill.  Cheap headphones with a blue light special fail.",0
2.0,So far so good! I do find wearing it for longer duration ...,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"So far so good!  I do find wearing it for longer duration ( &gt; 1 hr) hurting my jawline a little bit.  Other than that, it works like a charm...I have some additional information to share..BEWARE!!! This headset has a serious problem, at least the one I have.  There is no privacy with this headset.  It plays sounds indiscreetly.  My office mate could figure out all the songs I was listening to from a distance of 5 m.  This is not good at all.  Mpow needs to fix this problem.  All I need is that no sound should leak to others.  I am sorry to be hard on Mpow, but they should have tested this glitch with the headset design long time back.",1
2.0,NOT something too special..,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"The product is not bad, but it was not to my high expectations. The hands free mode is annoying, as it feels the headset was made for actual calls(as in Phone calls) than my little chatting get togethers on discord. what I mean by that is, while I'm in calls(example: Skype) I play music sometimes in my headset, this headset's mic ONLY works in hands free mode. meaning I CAN NOT use it in stereo mode, the issue here is within hands free mode the STEREO ""sounds"" such as my music, are highly decreased to boost the calls voices. I'm a bass lover and these headphones are not fit for those desires, even within Stereo mode, it's just not packing the power I require. I say its something nice to give your kids with low expectations but not someone like me with past experiences on better headpieces. I'll just give them to my younger brother, only way they'll actually be used without wasting my dollars entirely.",0
5.0,Immersive sound quality without the high price tag,"May 21, 2018",Yes,"I had never heard of this brand before, and was a little skeptical about buying. However, these headphones have surpassed all my expectations! The sound quality is wonderful and immersive, and similar to other, more expensive brands I demoed in big box stores. I love that these headphones fold up, too! The folding feature makes them super easy to transport to and from work in my purse. Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great pair of Bluetooth headphones!",0
4.0,... a set of over the ear headphones that would comfortably cover both of my ears until I bought these ...,"May 26, 2017",Yes,"I've never been able to find a set of over the ear headphones that would comfortably cover both of my ears until I bought these Mpow headphones. I have a large head (7 3/4 hat size) and every pair I've had in the past I had to wear on the back of my head instead of over the top. With these, not only do they fit well over the top of my head, but there is still one ""click"" left on each side to make it even longer. The only reason I'm not giving these a five star rating is because the bass is kind of weak.",2
5.0,"Good headphones, good company","April 1, 2018",Yes,"Very low battery life when not in use...The headphones work well, and if I use them immediately after charging, they will play for about 6 hours. However, once I remove the headphones and put them into their case (not turned on or trying to connect) they discharge faster than if I were listening to things. I've tried taking them to work only to find the fully charged headphones are useful for 1-2 hours of use before they need to be recharged...Edit: the company contacted me and replaced my faulty headphones. The replacement works amazingly well and the charge lasts a long time.",0
5.0,"Great headphones, super comfortable and great sound","April 20, 2017",Yes,"I purchased the <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Mpow-Swift-Bluetooth-4-0-Wireless-Sport-Headphones-Sweatproof-Running-Gym-Exercise-Headsets-Green/dp/B00NZTHGN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mpow Swift Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Sport Headphones Sweatproof Running Gym Exercise Headsets-Green</a> and was very happy with the quality of the sound and the fit and the product. I then decided I wanted something to stay around my ears. These headphones are so comfortable, I wear them everywhere and they don't move around. Highly pleased with the price of these considering Beats are super expensive.",1
5.0,Love them.,"August 17, 2018",Yes,"I've owned my pair for like 6 months now. I love them. Comfortable, great sound, holds a charge forever, Bluetooth​ works well. Pretty good at noise canceling too whether I'm working in a busy office or coffee shop. The little velour bag drawstring bag that comes with them is nice quality, and I love that I can fold them up and throw them in my backpack. I like the way they look. They're a little large where I wouldn't want to wear them for working out but I wear them for hours on end working at my computer. I also love to wear them when I'm cleaning the house.",0
3.0,"Good comfort, barely audible even at full blast in a gym.","November 22, 2017",Yes,"Two stars for the comfortable fit, two more for the ease of connecting to my phone.  Minus a star because I have to turn up the volume to three notches from full blast to hear any music in an area that is louder than a library or the lobby of a doctor's office.  In the gym I have to turn it up to full blast or just short of it.  The last two pairs of Bluetooth headphones I used, one of which this was a replacement for, I only had to turn up the volume to half or a little less than half to hear them in the same gym with the same ambient noise level.  What's the point of a pair of Bluetooth headphones a person can't use in a noisy place?",0
5.0,comfy...nice sound... light weight but stay put.,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"Love these for gym workouts and brisk power walks... not sure I could wear them for a 5 mile run though.....easy to connect... nice sound... can hear vehicle traffic along the road as it approaches.....seem pretty sturdy but I just got them a few weeks ago.. and while I'm in the gym 4-5 times a week, I'm a ""soft"" user at 60 years old...love the red!  color of power when I'm in the big boys' weight room!",0
4.0,Good Value,"May 6, 2017",Yes,"I bought these headphones to wear when I workout.  They pretty much deliver what a majority of the reviews say.  They are a very good value so far, but I have only had them for a week.  They are easy to link up to my I Phone, are comfortable for long wear, and sound pretty decent for the price.  No, they don't sound near as good as my $110 Sony headphones, but they really sound decent nevertheless.  I never have cared for plugs and don't want to damage what limited hearing I have left at my age, so I think these Mpow are a good compromise at a comfortable price.",0
4.0,Great Value for the Price,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"I'm really impressed with the number of features these headphones have for the price. The sound quality is about on par for what you'd expect in this price range. Not great, but decent. The passive noise isolating feature is about the same as covering your ears with your hands. It does reduce outside noise some, but you can still hear what's going on around you. With music on though, it's enough to drown out causal conversations around you. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. Great value for the price.",0
5.0,AMAZING! Great sound,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"AMAZING!.Great sound, no more worrying about running after my kids and breaking speakers, computer jacks, or wires. These are by far the most comfortable headphones I've ever had. Easy to move around the house and do chores, sit and write stories, and let the kids pass them around without worrying about any cord getting stuck on something or choking anyone... It's just awesome. Now hubby wants one of his own.",0
5.0,Exactly what I needed.,"June 7, 2017",Yes,"I have a large property and it takes roughly 8 hours total to mow it.  To cut the boredom; I like to listen to audiobooks and with these headphones I can hear perfectly, even over the sound of a large ZTR. The sound is great, connecting to my Bluetooth devices is a breeze, and the controls are simple.  I highly recommend.",2
5.0,I'm Impressed,"February 26, 2018",Yes,"I have had these for 2 or 3 weeks and they're great so far. I took them right out of the box without even charging them once and they still haven't died! I use them for 2+ hours a day, 5 days a week during my commute and at work and right now they're sitting solidly at 60%...The sound is pretty good. Not amazing but for the price, it's fine. And I've been told the mic is clear is as well! Which I wasn't expecting since I almost always have trouble with mics picking up my soft\quiet voice...The turning off \ turning on announcement goes off at max volume no matter what so... That's kind of annoying but it's minor. Just everyone around me knows when my headphones get turned on or off.",0
4.0,Great customer service,"January 7, 2018",Yes,Edit: The company noticed my review and were eager to set things right. They asked for a photo and model number so they could find the problem. They sent us a brand new pair and they've been working perfectly. Great Goodall's for customer satisfaction!..Original post:  My son was extremely happy with these for about 3 months. After that the batteries do not hold a charge at all. Now these headphones need to be plugged into the wall to work. Garbage.,1
5.0,So glad I have these a try!,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"I was a little skeptical on buying this product based on how great the ratings were &amp; how cheap the headset is but after I gave it a chance I can see why. This headset is AMAZING...- comfortable to wear.- noise cancellation WITHOUT needing batteries which is great.- comes with backup wired cable that work even when the headset is completely out of battery (some headsets require power to use cable).- Bluetooth range is surprisingly good, I was able to listen to my music while my phone was in my room upstairs &amp; I had gone to the kitchen downstairs.- built very well.- I have big ears &amp; wearing these are truly over ear as my ears are completely covered.- pairing is very easy to do (just hold the center button for 2 seconds while the headset is on..Overall, I would definitely buy again.",1
4.0,"Not noise cancelling, but otherwise great","April 25, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable, great price. I really wanted foldable headphones. PS the Bluetooth connects instantly!!!..But I got confused looking at too many options, (and reading all the reviews) and inadvertently bought non-noise canceling headphones, which I really wanted. Therefore, they are not noise cancelling,  I should have realized the price was too good...Other than that I really like them but only had a few days.",0
5.0,so far so good,"October 14, 2018",Yes,"So far so good, it's comfortable and sound is good...con might be:.- automated voice saying ""connected"" and ""your headset is disconnected"".- the sound will spill out from the headset, other ppl might over hear the sound so beware wearing it outside..since i'm using this in my room for listening to music while i'm working, it's all good.",1
3.0,Bluetooth short lived,"May 28, 2018",Yes,"Revised Review:.The company sent me a replacement without any hassle or charges...I appreciate the customer care. That is why I give this product a 3 star from its original 1 star...So far, the product works. I have to give it at least 3 months before I can truly suggest whether this purchase and product is quality...Old Review: Received these on March 24,2018..It’s a pretty good product WHEN it works...I thought there was something wrong with my phone at first or that I did not charge this long enough. I charged it. Still nothing...But then I tried it out on newer versions of the same phone and other brands. That’s when I realized the Bluetooth feature wasn’t working anymore...I give this product a 1 star because it literally only took less than 3 months to break down. I recommend to others to spend a bit more on better products that you know will have a better life span.",0
5.0,Great buy for the money,"October 24, 2017",Yes,"These are very comfortable cushioned fit over-the-ear headphones.  The sound quality is good and well worth the money. These are not noise filtering but worked fine on a flight. The sound does bleed through but that was expected since these are not noise cancelling. These are passive noise isolating and not active noise cancellation. They come with a velvet bag for the foldable headsets, USB cord for charging and an audio cable for plugging into the headset.  Bluetooth connects quickly to my android device.",0
5.0,Great product,"July 31, 2018",Yes,"I’ve been using these for almost a week now and so far they’ve been great! I got these because I was so sick of constantly having to push my earbuds back into my ear while running, but I was hesistsnt to get these because I didn’t know how loud the music would be... they’re perfect! They stay in place and the music goes plenty loud enough! For the price I don’t really have any complaintsn",0
4.0,"Good for noise cancelling, a little tight","December 20, 2017",Yes,"I really enjoy the Bluetooth capabilities of these headphones: it connects with my phone with no problems. Also, they are definitely noise cancelling: I can sit on a busy train and hear little to no sound outside of my music. However, I do find that the headphones are a little tight on my head, which can lead to headaches after a while. Additionally, the aux cable that came with the headphones to connect to a phone in a traditional way, has already failed on me. That sucks, but I can always get another cable.",1
4.0,Sound and battery is amazing.,"May 24, 2018",Yes,The sound quality is pretty amazing. Some nights before I go to bed I wear these to listen to some music and one night in particular I was listening to Syre by Jaden Smith and the only thing I could hear was the music but there was a banging on the wall. I panicked and worried if for some reason the music was coming from my phone and headphones at the same time and my neighbors were annoyed by the music. So I took my headphones off and heard these incredibly loud obscene moans and whimpers. Turns out my neighbors were having intense sex and the banging was their bed post against the wall but once I put my headphones on again everything was silent and peaceful. Also since I’ve first charged these they have yet to be needed to recharge and I’ve already fallen asleep with them on like 2 or 3 times now. My only problem is that the mic isn’t the best but I don’t intend on using them for phone calls.,0
5.0,WOW. JUST....WOW,"September 12, 2017",Yes,"WOW. JUST...WOW.  i just received these headphones, and I was compelled to write a quick review (unlike me to do this).  My use will be casual listening, and primarily for the gym.  First of all, the red ones are absolutely gorgeous.  Quality and build looks like an expensive competitor's appearance.  The ear pads are perfect as they cover my ears, completely (so, they are around the ear, not just over-ear, and i wear glasses).  Very comfortable and completely adjustable.  Bluetooth works perfectly.  If you are an audiophile, then don't bother with these, and just spend a couple hundred dollars and get those.  The sound on these is surprisingly good!!  First impressions are HUGE with me, and this company (Mpow) has just won over a long-term customer!",0
5.0,Headphones were great... BUT...*Updated*,"September 23, 2017",Yes,"*Updated post* The customer service team was amazing, they got back to me quickly with a new pair, no questions asked. They have great customer service, fast and friendly. I'm really sorry I didn't update my review sooner! Thank you so much! I left my previous review below for better clarity...Headphones were great but cracked easily. In the normal course of taking them out of the bag they are made for, the headphones cracked, I really love these headphones, great sound and quality but hopefully they will have good customer service as they resulted in course of use as intended with the bag they came with. I will call them this week, hopefully to give 5 stars... or to lose some if they are not helpful, but I am hopeful that they will work with me on a replacement, and I will know NOT to use the bag they come with for carrying them with me.",1
2.0,The buttons shake and make an irritating noise,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"Everything works fine, as advertised. However, the buttons jiggle around. It's not like i'm bouncing around either. Even if I'm slightly tilting my head they make this loud, annoying noise. They, obviously drive me crazy when I go out jogging. When I blast heavy metal I can still hear it. Nothing wrong with the functionality of the buttons they just are a design flaw. I have a huge feeling that if I exchange them, that same design flaw will be there, so I'm not going through the effort. I'm pretty disappointed, though because the distraction takes the enjoyment out of them.",0
5.0,Great for PS4 and XBOne,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"We bought my son these for Christmas - and they lived up to all the positive reviews...I was looking for headphones to wear at night when I play video games, so I bought a pair for myself. These work great - wonderful sound and very comfortable. Note: these won’t allow in-game chat - which I don’t care about...Easy connect to PS4 and XB controllers using the included wire...I easily connected the headset to my iPhone and MacBook using Bluetooth - music sounds great as well.",0
5.0,Skip the beats and get these!,"July 21, 2018",Yes,I LOVE THESE. They fit so well and are noise reducing. I love that the volume goes up pretty high and you have the control buttons on the side. They are super cute and an amazing alternative to beats headphones. I got these for when I clean and go to the gym and having a cordless headset is super nice. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing these over brand name ones for sure. My husband has Beats headphones and these are seriously just as good if not better and you save so much money!!!,0
5.0,Superb!,"May 24, 2018",Yes,"I was hesitant at first when I order this item. However, to my surprised it exceeds my expectations. The unit itself was designed nicely. Im using this primarily for my audio nursing reviewer. I am very satisfied with the quality. Great steal!!!",1
4.0,Great sound for the price. Comfy too!,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"I love these. Very comfy, great sound, clarity. They fold up slightly, I travel a lot and these seem to be of very sturdy quality.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars for only one reason..my spouse can hear what I am listening to when we are in bed which is the reason I bought them, to allow him to sleep/watch TV undisturbed. They do not hold the sound in as well as the $200-300 ones do.  They do sound almost as good though.  My daughter has $300 Bose and she was impressed with these. I like the option of blue tooth or wired.",0
5.0,Didn't work :-(  REVISION 3/18/2018,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"Bummed.  Really liked it for the couple minutes it worked.  Comfortable.  Headset would not hold charge (left plugged in overnight before first use).  Unable to pair it with my Amazon Fire, though could with my Samsung phone.  Volume control did not work.  Hoped to use on my next flight..Edit:  Got replacement headphones from Mpow.  Wow!  Love them.  Such great sound, so comfortable and easy to use. Had no trouble pairing to my car and one of my tablets.  Am enjoying them thoroughly.",0
1.0,Doesn't last long pairing,"November 30, 2018",Yes,They were good for months now they won't pair. I never dropped them. They never got wet. These are probably the worst headphones quality wise i have ever had. Please don't buy this. Off brands always have problems. So angry at this company for its cheap quality. I only use them to work out. Please take heed to this review. You will be angry for not taking my advice. I want a replacement. Tired of going through this.,0
2.0,Disappointed,"August 20, 2017",Yes,"Does not connect with bluetooth to my MacBook Pro. Does, however, connect to my iPhone 6 Plus. However, I bought it for my laptop so I'm really disappointed. When I connect it with the wire included, the sound works but also has VERY static-y background noise. =/.2 stars because the headphones are super comfortable and looks beautiful. Doesn't help to get the job done though.",1
2.0,Not bad headphones but a pain to turn on-off,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"As far as the headphones go, the sound is pretty good for the price. Unfortunately, getting them to turn on and off is a real pain. Push the button to turn them off and it goes into pairing mode and it’s not easy to get it out and it does it again. Not worth the hassle.",1
4.0,Pretty good,"April 16, 2018",Yes,"I like these. Not gonna be as good a shoving earbuds in your ear holes but they're great for shutting off reality while I do housework. They're a bit beefy tho and if you have it up to a decent volume, others nearby will hear it too.  So, still no Pantera and Rage Against the Machine while the kids are home lol.  ps..look up Black Water Rising. They breathe life back into rock! Albums 1 and 2 are fairly clean.",0
5.0,Love the soft string bag for the cables and travel/storing,"April 4, 2018",Yes,"These look elegant. Love the soft string bag for the cables and travel/storing. I use it for both my iPhone and mac (or office desktop computer), sometimes both connected simultaneously. Sound is great. Buttons are for the most part comfortably placed and I rarely press the wrong one on accident. I feel it muffles outside noise just a bit. Best part, it does not sit directly on my ears but rather around, so they are quite comfortable.",0
4.0,These headphones are very comfortable. I can hear the person on the other ...,"July 26, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are very comfortable.  I can hear the person on the other one very clearly; unfortunately, they can't hear me very well.  Everyone says that I sound ""choppy"".  Beside that, I love the sound quality when playing music.  I use it mainly while stationary at my computer and feel like for the price, they are pretty good when compared to my $300 headphones that I usually travel with.",1

5.0,"Love these, get rid of the light!","February 26, 2018",Yes,"Ordered these to watch tv on my phone while in bed.  They are really easy to set up and connect to your phone, and I haven't had to charge them at all since I got them.  What I hate: THE BLINKING LIGHT.  This is super annoying, especially at night.  I put a piece of electrical tape over it, and problem is solved for my use.  I don't use these for noise cancelling, so I can't speak to that.  However, for a basic set of Bluetooth headphones, this works great.",0
5.0,Great performance and value!,"March 11, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great! I bought my daughter a pair for Xmas this past year and was very happy with the quality. I was so happy with the quality and fit that I decided to buy myself a pair. I use them daily in the gym and have been happy ever since. The sound quality is much better than I expected and gets pretty loud. I recommend purchasing if you are looking for good value. I use them for music only, so can't give a great report on the microphone for phone calls. In my opinion, they are worth the investment even if the microphone isn't the greatest.",0
4.0,"Sound quality was ok, but slightly uncomfortable and they were returned.","February 5, 2018",Yes,"UPDATED 03/15/18 - Customer service has been great and they reached out to me to send me a different model to try, to make up for the bad one initially received. The replacement model works great. Seems like a great company/customer service...After wearing them for an hour at the gym, they started hurting my head from the squeezing together on my head. Cushioing and quality was mediocre.  Sound quality was just ok. Price was pretty good but ultimately, I returned them because I wasn't happy with them.",1
4.0,Sound 6/10 Comfort 10/10 Build Quality 7/10 For the money ...,"August 28, 2017",Yes,"Sound 6/10.Comfort 10/10.Build Quality 7/10..For the money, nothing can beat these. $30 headphones that have the build quality of $100 headphones and the comfort of $200 headphones. They still however, have the sound of inexpensive headphones. There is little to no punch to the bass. If they had even a little more in the bass department I'd give them 5 stars.",1
5.0,Awesome Sauce,"June 28, 2017",Yes,"I'm not a techy or a gamer, so this is just your average person's review. I love these because they are completely around the ear (your ear ends up in a little soft house), they are comfortable for my bigger than average head, I can wear them with my large plastic framed glasses without issue, the controls on the side are great, they are mic wireless and speaker wireless, they are easy to set up with both PCs and Macs (I am using them across several devices at home and at work), they are rechargeable (no more need for constantly consumed batteries), and there is not any sound leakage. For the money, these headphones are AWESOME! I'm seriously glad that I purchased them.",7
1.0,Better Off Elsewhere,"October 19, 2018",Yes,I used to really love these headphones. I thought they were a great bang for your buck but mine mysteriously stopped being to hold a charge. It didn't matter what outlet or charger I used..I have tried to contact the company with no response despite purchasing the protection plan. Sucks and I feel ripped off!,2
5.0,Excuse my ignorance.,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"Received the phones on December 8,2017. Stopped pairing after 40 days. I wish they were still working as I was  very satisfied with the performance. Tried pairing with several devices with no results. Unfortunately I misplaced the pamphlet and am unable to contact the dealer. Wish I was filing a 5. They were great while they worked.  EDIT:  my son was visiting and found that I had two devices pairing to it. I'm 87 years old and that is my excuse for my tech. Ingnoance. Phones work good now.  My wife loves them. Going to order another set for myself. The best thing I like about them is the service. They read my review and are sending me another set. I will send them back. I fermlly believe that their are some one star reviews and complaints just to receive a free item. Good phones,good service you can't do any better then that.  Buy it.",0
5.0,So Comfortable,"October 25, 2018",Yes,These headphones are fabulous! Sound is great and the set up is extremely easy! When I'm wearing these I forget I have them on because they are so soft and comfortable. They completely cancel out any external noise while the sound quality of the TV itself is excellent! I highly recommend these Mpow bluetooth headphones; great quality at a very convenient price.,0
5.0,These headphones are awesome! The sound clarity is great,"July 24, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are awesome! The sound clarity is great, easy to pair with any device I have, and the ease of functions are smooth. I press on the side function keys while I have them on my head, and it is so easy ! The comfort on my ear is pleasant, and I don't feel like I have a heavy, cumbersome object on my head. It holds a charge for a long time; although I have not timed it really. I have charged them once in the last week or so. I love them, and will definitely buy more. It beats the expensive $200 headphones out there for now. Even though these headphones are wireless, it still comes with a headphone jack to plug into a computer. Quality is nice. It comes with a cute, and yet functional drawstring storage pouch, which has a soft suede like feel. It looks stylish! I hope to have these for a long time. I will purchase more of these for my class, and spare to keep home for my teens!!",0
4.0,Good quality for price,"September 1, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this product a few weeks ago and so far I am very pleased. The sound quality for music and video are excellent and the heatset is comfortable, though it is slightly tight so I have to take it off periodically. The Bluetooth functionally is very convenient and I appreciate that it comes with a long cord so I can plug it in to my computer, which is not Bluetooth compatible. Battery life is still going strong as well. I haven't needed to charge it yet...The headset blocks out a good amount of sound as well. It will greatly dampen normal speaking volume, but only slightly block out a dryer, for example...My only gripe is that the sound quality for calls is very poor both for myself and the caller on the other end. It is definitely not a replacement for the Samsung Bluetooth headsets.",1
5.0,Build quality is good. Haven't ran the battery down yet,"October 18, 2017",Yes,"So first, I am a sound engineer so I am very picky with headphones...In the bass section - 200hz and less it is Okay, and nothing to write home about. Muddy quality...In the low mid range section - 300-500hz a bit clearer...in the upper mid range 600hz - 1k is okay...In the 2k to 4k ... this is where it lacks the most - there's not really any enjoyable sizzle...5k and above - its okay...but for 35$ ... i'll give it 5 stars especially if you are able to tweak EQ settings...Build quality is good. Haven't ran the battery down yet. They are fairly comfortable except on the top of my head.",1
5.0,Easy to set up.,"October 25, 2018",Yes,I connected this to our Samsung Smart TV. It was very easy to get paired with the TV and once that's set up it remembers so you don't have to do it each time you want to use them. They seem to be well made and the sound quality is great. Now I can get some sleep when my husband wants to have the TV blaring loud at night. I'm very happy with this purchase.,0
5.0,Very easy to use.,"May 6, 2017",Yes,"I bought these for use with my computer which has Bluetooth built in, however I've also used this for my phone with great results. The mic can be very quiet and only ""telephone"" quality, but the audio coming from the headphones is great. I suggest if you have bigger ears like me you take them off every so often and let your ears have a rest. Long battery life is a huge plus. These also come with a bag so you can easily port them around since they do fold up.",1
4.0,"Great set, certainly worth the price when on sale","March 23, 2018",Yes,"SO much better than the last headset I tried from Amazon. MUCH better audio quality -- glad to see they didn't cheap out on the audio hardware...Battery is a little small compared to what they could have fit in (0.4Ah) but works FLAWLESSLY on Debian &amp; Android. Cannot vouch for other OSes, but it probably works great on them too. I'm really happy to have gotten this for under $40! And it even comes in a pretty pink color! Nice bonus! ^.^",0
5.0,Sweet head phones,"January 12, 2018",Yes,Excellent wireless Bluetooth head phones. I listen to my music on my iPhone as well as Pandora. The headphones have good sound and clarity. The battery lasts as well. You can control song changes and volume using the phone or the headset. They are very comfortable on your ears and head. Perfect device.,1
5.0,... I ever bought and I gotta say they worked like a charm,"February 14, 2018",Yes,These headphones where my first set of headphones I ever bought and I gotta say they worked like a charm. Instead of spending like  $200 to like $300 bucks on a pair of headphone these where just plain satisfying for its price of only like what $40 bucks. It fits very comfortable on my ears and if your a person that wears glasses these headphones do not bother you while wearing them at all. Also the sound is awesome you can’t hear anything when you are enjoying bumping your music while relaxing. It’s only you and your music your jaming on when you just want your alone time. I highly recommend you buying these headphones if you are looking rig for something inexpensive that works excellent.,0
4.0,Better than expected but not great,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"They feel pretty good on my ears at least after a few minutes. They have good range and solid signal, only started barely breaking up when my phone was in one corner downstairs and I was in the opposite corner upstairs. The sound quality is a little higher than what you’d expect out of $35 wired headphones. The thing that bothers me the most is the lack of low end. I miss the clarity from multiple drivers but that’s not really something you can expect from $35 headphones.",1
4.0,Not loud enough,"August 7, 2018",Yes,Everything works exactly as described by the seller. I only have one dislike about these headphones...I wish that the headphone speakers could be a little bit louder. I have the volume setting turned all the way up and it’s is not as clear and loud as my $15 Sony wired headphones...I use these in the gym and I can still hear so much background / environmental noise.,0
5.0,Very nice - sound great!,"February 14, 2018",Yes,"I use these mainly for television. After disappointment with a different brand, I am extremely satisfied with this pair. Sound quality is very good and the battery charge lasts me for several days of 3-4 hours use daily. Build quality is very high. They fold easily for storage in the nice bag that is provided. They fit me perfectly and are comfortable for several hours of use. I can highly recommend these without hesitation.",0
3.0,Good Passive Noise Cancelling but Sound Leakage,"February 4, 2018",Yes,"I stupidly misread the description and was under the impression that these headphones are active noise cancelling, however they are passive. However, the passive noise cancelling is quite good! And I actually do not regret misreading the description as this saves the battery more. The one downside to these headphones is that the music/ whatever you're listening to is VERY audible to others. They're the equivalent of very poor speakers and I feel this sound leakage will deter me from using these headphones in public as they'll likely disturb others.",0
4.0,Great bluetooth reception and customer service,"October 18, 2018",Yes,"*update 11/7/2018 - they sent me a new pair which is very nice customer service. i will keep using them and i hope they hold up over a few months use...These headphones are comfortable and the bluetooth works well at a good distance. However, after only about a month of use the headband padding is detaching from the plastic. It appears it was just barely glued on and it won't be that easy to fix. If it all falls off it won't be wearable, defeating the purpose of having the nice bluetooth.",0
5.0,Price/Quality=Excellent,"August 11, 2017",Yes,"These are great quality and a REAL bargain. Yes, it is true that after wearing them for 2+ hours your ears hurt a bit from the pressure, but it happens with pretty much all headphones. They are also beautifully made, and the sound is great, even if you listen to classical music, there will be nothing to complain about. Highly recommended.",1
5.0,Great buy!,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"I’ve had the Mpow ear buds for about 3 years now and still haven’t had any issues. Purchasing these was an easy decision to make and I’m not disappointed so far. They’ve stayed on at the gym and the sound quality is great considering the price tag. I mean you can’t expect $200 quality in $35 headphones, lets be real. It’s soundproof enough that people have to tap me on the shoulder at the gym to get my attention so I’m happy!",0
5.0,Better late than never,"August 30, 2017",Yes,"Ordered this headset for vacation plane travel (order fulfilled by Amazon, not the product seller).  Timely Prime delivery was hosed: UPS reported it delivered when it was NOT, and actually delivered it 5 days LATER, per my house sitter, so was unable to use it during vacation.  Sure wish I'd had it on the planes...it's an awesome headset!!  Very comfortable on the ears, easily paired with my smart phone, no annoying cord and sound is incredible!  An Audible subscriber, I can't wait to start a new book!",0
4.0,Great!,"October 30, 2017",Yes,"The quality of the sound is really good. It's definitely better than what I had prepared myself to hear when I ordered the item. The only down side is that it's not very good at eliminating outside noise and the sound is pretty clear to hear by others near you. My friend was sitting at a table across from me and could hear what I was listening to. Other than this, the sound quality is really good and sits very comfortable on my head...Overall, a great product!",0
4.0,Awesome headphone!,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"My 11yo son like this!  It is his birthday present:-) Though he has a small head, it would still stay on his head without falling when he just sits down playing video games. He is amazed how it connects easy to his pc and to his iPad.  The sound from the headphone is awesome.  Though it is not a cancelling noise from the outside, he still has to lift the headphone to hear us.  His issue is he sweat fast with this headphone.  But other than that, it is a very good quality.",0
4.0,Solid bang for your buck &amp; unparalleled commitment to customer service,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"For whatever reason, the buttons responsible for skipping changing songs (both skip and go back) weren't working when I first received the product. Also, the volume control buttons were only working part of  the time. I also experienced a slight decrease in quality of lower-pitched sounds after about 3 months of reasonably extensive use. However, the company was kind enough to send me another pair, no questions asked. So, I would recommend giving these headphones a shot. The Value/Price ratio is one of the best I've experienced in the headphone market.",0
5.0,Works great with Sony blue ray CD player,"April 29, 2018",Yes,Got this to go with my Sony Bluetooth blue ray CD player that I also ordered from Amazon..This was for my dad that don’t hear very well..He loves them and said they work great for him..Now we can enjoy not being blow away by the loud sounds from the tv..,1
5.0,Perfect for just about anyone.,"October 6, 2017",Yes,Sounds pretty good. Only thing is for me it's slightly uncomfortable on top of head.  But I've bought 5 or 6 different headsets the past few years and in my price range of $30-$150 that I've spent on them none have felt good.  I think I'm just an earbuds kind of guy so for almost anyone else these would be perfect.  For the price I'd say they can't be beat.,1
2.0,"Not that good for BT audio, good for wired audio.","February 26, 2018",Yes,"Headphones looked good, felt ok while wearing them, but bluetooth audio was distorted and weak.  Audio while plugged in was clear and crisp, excellent reproduction.  I tried two different BT audio sources that I have used in the past, and both gave identical results.  Thinking that perhaps it was a battery issue, I let it charge overnight and repeated the experiment, with the same weak and distorted results.  Repackaged and returned.",0
2.0,Comfortable but incompatible,"October 25, 2017",Yes,"Comfortable but incompatible. It won’t connect to my computer. Numerous people have had the same problem with the headphones being unable to connect due to missing drivers. A simple google search will show what I mean. I emailed the company and this was their response,..“Dear Customer,..Thanks for your email. We do apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. We are sorry that currently we don't provide any drivers for our customers. Some customers told us that the item can not install and pair with their specific brand laptop. Could you please download the newest Bluetooth drivers from your laptop brand's website to have a try?..If it still doesn’t work, could you please ask for a friend who knows about the computer to update the Bluetooth chipset to have a try?..Hope your understanding in advance.”..Literally, their advice was for me to find a friend who is computer savvy. Ridiculous.",0
5.0,Amazing battery life and reach!!!,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"I have been using these for about a month now.  Great headphones.  I'm an open area the Bluetooth works well enough that I do not want to be that far from my phone.  At the gym and through walls, ""depending on what the wall is made of,"" you have atleast 30 to 40 feet before it cuts out. Oh and the battery life is amazing.  I'm still on my first charge.  Again I use these for about 2 hrs a day 6 days a week at the gym, and I turn it off when I'm done using them.  That's enough to impress me.  They are comfortable and sound proof to outside noises.  The ear muff material holds up great to sweating.  They hold I'm place well while running and are adjustable.  I do have to take them off for a couple of exercises because they get in the way, but that's very few.",0
5.0,Great headphones for the price. Good sound quality. Long lasting,"September 25, 2018",Yes,"I'm about 2 years in and these are still the best wireless headphones I've owned for the price. They're durable, dependable, and for the price very worth the purchase. The sound quality is very good. But I'm no audio expert, they get the job done. My only complaint would be the leakage of moisture that occurs when I lay them down on a surface..I get an entire day of usage out of them and even the next day for bit. The range is fair but when I move to the kitchen I lose some sound quality but my laptop is older and that may be the cause. Phone holds up better with distance.",0
5.0,Definitely the best pick out there!,"September 13, 2017",Yes,"When I got those headphones, the first thing that hit me was the slick design, they are very comfortable to wear, they don't move easily off your head, I've been running with them with no problem at all and easy to fold. And also, the battery life is surprisingly very (very) long. it took me 3 weeks of usage to get the ""battery low"" warning. And super easy to charge with its mini-USB port compatible with most android chargers. For the price, the sound quality is really good. A definite must-buy, I would recommend!",2
5.0,"Comfy, great sounding headphones for the money, and multiple uses in a solid build! Great buy!","March 11, 2018",Yes,"Ordered these because I needed BT headphones and they were the cheapest pair with the best reviews. For the price I really didn't expect the quality to be as good as they actually are. They last a long time battery-wise (about 12 hours) and they charge pretty fast too. If you run out of battery just plug in a AUX cable and you are good to go with no power at all.  Solid feel and comfort aside from the cheap-ish buttons which is not a factor I consider when buying headphones, and the buttons function just fine . Seriously impressed with the build quality overall. I was expecting them to have a cheap feel and sub par sound.  The sound quality is not amazing quality but is REALLY REALLY good considering they are under 40 dollars. Surpassed my expectations bigtime. They block out an impressive amount of outer noise as well. Doing chores around the house while listening to podcasts or music is great because i can take calls with them. Call quality is great and people on the other end can hear me well too. One of my favorite purchases ive made from amazon. GET EM!",0
5.0,Surprised,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"I bought these to use with my PC because I would rather not use my surround sound with the PC and the headphones I had were of good quality but uncomfortable and they were not wireless. Because of the price, I wasn't expecting much in the way of sound quality and it is much better than I thought it would be. Setting up the wireless with Bluetooth on the PC took less than a minute. I could not be happier with this product.",0
5.0,Great headset - Exellent Customer Service!,"September 24, 2018",Yes,I received a defective headset and the seller was very quick to replace it.  This headset is wonderful and priced just the same.  The sound is of good quality.  The battery life and range is also good.  Great product for the price!,1
5.0,Awesome for the price...,"November 16, 2017",Yes,"I've owned a pair of $250 Bose forever and I love them, they are awesome. But I recently purchased a pair of the Mpow 059's at the cost of $40 and these are unbelievable. Their not as good for noise cancellation as the Bose but I don't think most people wouldn't be able to tell if they haven't heard the Bose. For $40 these are well worth every penny and also the best for the cost......Just buy them!!",1
2.0,Good For A While,"August 7, 2017",Yes,"I liked these headphones a lot for the first month, then the wheels fell off...I started hearing loud static and other odd sounds even when not plugged in or listening to anything.  I contacted customer service and they responded quickly, suggesting I do a full charge, which I did (5+ hours).  This did not help, in fact, now the left side no longer gets anything but static...At present I am requesting a refund so I can buy another product. Will update review with outcome...Very disappointed at this is situation.",1
4.0,Good deal for the price point,"October 5, 2017",Yes,"Not bad for the price. The bass is a bit ""boxy"" sounding but a decent eq takes care of it. Great battery life. Mine stays on 8 hours every workday. Charge overnight - no problems. The mic is very low volume making it hard to use as an actual communications headset but it will do in a pinch. Overall happy with the quality and price.",1
5.0,"These are incredibly sturdy, and even have metal inserts along the band","December 24, 2017",Yes,"My last pair of headphones snapped in two as I was putting them on one night, so I bought these as a replacement. These are incredibly sturdy, and even have metal inserts along the band. They technically work on wireless mode, however when they were brand new out of the box they had a tendency to stutter on Bluetooth. They seemed to have stopped stuttering, but there is a noticeable static in the background that gets distracting. However, they work perfectly with the cord attached, and I can live without them being wireless. Very impressed so far!",0
4.0,Good Budget-worthy headphones,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"Bought these headphones when my old earbuds broke. Headphones have become the trend for sound once again, so I thought I'd see what the market had...I wanted something good with sound, Bluetooth capable, and cost-efficient (read: not beats or bose). Came across these and ordered a pair and really like them! They met my criteria and are quite good when it comes sound. They have a good battery life, too. I can usually go a couple of days or longer without having to charge them (listening 3-4 hours per day)...The only thing I don't like about them is they're a little uncomfortable if you wear glasses. They push the arms of my glasses in and cause a little discomfort. They're definitely wearable and I like them, but I have to take breaks from them if I'm wearing my glasses for the day...Bottom line: they're great for the price and if you're on a budget.",0
5.0,Not the headphones problem,"September 9, 2018",Yes,Windows 10 update caused an audio driver failure.  Uploaded new driver and the headphone work fine now.,3
3.0,Bad battery life,"October 20, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are pretty average. They do the trick and are moderately comfortable, but there isn't anything spectacular about the feel or sound quality. Also, the battery life is not even CLOSE to what is advertised. It says it last for 13 hours of bluetooth playback, but I get about 3 listening to music. It's pretty cheap, so I guess I can't really expect great quality, but its disappointing that the battery life is so much shorter than advertised.",1
5.0,They have sold a boat load of them for a reason.,"April 11, 2018",Yes,"Great for watching TV when my wife is asleep. I can wander off into the kitchen or bathroom and it still works great. Sound quality is pretty OK and the weight is reasonable. I'm not going to trade my Audio Technicas for these, but they serve a purpose... I wish the volume control was on a separate rocker button since it's a little hard to tell which button your fingers are on when it's on your head.",0
5.0,Incredible for a regular person.,"October 11, 2018",Yes,"Super comfortable and sound fantastic..If your a sound freak there might be room for improvement..With my computer,phone and Roku they are incredible to me..First video I watched on the Tube I couldn't believe what I was missing..I will use these while holding down the couch 90% of the time and they are very comfortable leaning back into the cushion.",0
5.0,... these for about a month but so far I love them! The sound quality is very good and ...,"April 4, 2018",Yes,I’ve only had these for about a month but so far I love them! The sound quality is very good and you can walk fairly far from your phone without dropping the signal. For the price they’re amazing. They charge quickly and the charge last for quite some time.  I use them mostly at the gym but love to use them even more for meditation music. I would definitely buy them again. Hopefully they will last for a while,0
2.0,"Built great, but sound terrible.","July 12, 2017",Yes,"These headphones feel great, they seem solid, they're easy to use etc.  They get a star simply for being solid sounding.  Unfortunately, they sound terrible.  Overall they sound flat.  The bass is practically absent, and the treble is grainy.  At mid-high volume there is lots of distortion in the high end, and the lows just disappear.  If you're looking for a pair of comfortable, well built headphones that aren't a significant investment, go with the MEE over ears, or the wave/runway series.  For just a few dollars more you get an equally impressive build with vastly superior sound.",1
5.0,Fantastic product!  You will not be disappointed!,"September 19, 2018",Yes,I've had this headset for over a few weeks now.  I bought for my son. He loves them!  He has told me more than once how much he loves them.  Lol!  Battery life us amazing.  Super comfortable all around  and charges quickly.  Came with a bag to store then in and some kind of adapter I believe to use without the bluetooth.  We haven't gotten there yet but I'm sure one day will come in handy.,0
5.0,Great sound and very comfortable.,"May 31, 2018",Yes,"I'm very happy with these headphones.  They sound great, especially considering the price.  My ears are big but they fit really comfortably.  The sound is very balanced and clear and the bluetooth latency seems minimal. Great buy!..ALSO!!!! Mpow has a really great eq app that you can download that works specifically with their headphones.  It makes these headphones even better!",0
5.0,Perfect Solution for My Needs,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"This headset is fantastic. I literally use it 5-6 days of the week when I do yard work or I'm sitting in my desk at work. The charge lasts for days and the recharge time is quick. They are also comfortable, collapsible, and the design looks nice as well. For a budget Bluetooth headset I don't know if you can do better than this. The audio quality is great as well (at least for me) for games, podcasts, or music.",0
2.0,Voices sound muffled,"December 13, 2017",Yes,"Voices sound distant in music - like there is no treble. Instruments in songs blow your ears out and you can barely hear the voices. I'm not even picky, just wanted something with a little more bass than a cheap set of earbuds...Too bad because I can tell the the sound and build quality is there but this one thing kills it. If you could just turn the treble up a bit it would probably fix it, but as far as I know you can't...You get what you pay for.",1
4.0,UPDATED - FIXED - Wont Pair with anything but my MacBook.,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"Update: Patozon reached out to me after my initial review and helped me restore the factory settings on the headphones. After doing so, they paired instantly with my Bluetooth Transmitter/TV. They are a tad bit heavy as some others have posted, but the sound is fantastic...This rating is subject to change if perhaps someone could help. I can pair these with my MacBook Pro and they work fine. But they will not pair with ANYTHING else. It will not connect at all with my TV/Bluetooth Transmitter. For the iPhone, the voice says that it's connected, but there is no sound from any App including iTunes, Amazon Prime, YouTube, etc. I have another pair of earbuds I bought for $7 that connect seamlessly. Anyone have a similar issue? I'm going to return them, but wanted to put feelers out there in the chance that someone else had a similar issue and had it resolved.",0
5.0,Great Sound For The Price,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"This headset is pretty awesome. My first one had a faulty power button, but the company quickly sent out a new one that works great. The sound is great, especially when you consider the price. I wear these several hours a day, and the battery gets me through a week at a time at least. I wear these when I'm running and don't have any issues with them slipping off. They also work great for mowing the yard. I'll definitely buy this brand again in the future.",0
5.0,"I enjoy them, but wanted something with a little more ...","September 24, 2017",Yes,"I bought some in ear bluetooth earphones about a year ago from the same brand. I enjoy them, but wanted something with a little more audio depth. These have that. Super easy to set up. Super snug on my noggin'. They fold up nicely for storage or travel and come with a little bag. I have yet to charge them (the charge lasts quite a long time!), but I'm sure they'll charge nicely and quickly.",1
4.0,"Great Headphones, No wired microphone","March 10, 2018",Yes,"Great headphones for the price, only one thing I noticed after buying. The microphone doesn’t work in wired mode. I advise buying this if youJabees 3.5mm Aux Audio Cable to Connect Headphones/Headsets with Gaming Devices such as Xbox/P4P, Replacement Audio Cable with Mic and Volume Control for Music and Voice Streaming for Cellphone -Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010JI2X0C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_r5aPAb7FNKENR",2
5.0,Excellent quality headphones for a low price,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"I was looking for Bluetooth over the ear headphones but did not want to spend beats pricing. I bought these thinking I’ll use them until my birthday and ask for the beats then. Well I love these so much I will not be asking for the beats. The sound is excellent, they are comfy, and easy to use. I talk on the phone with them too and it works well. Not as great as the iPhone headphones but decent enough. They also keep my ears warm in the winter :) If you are looking for a great pair of headphones and not break the bank look no further! I also love the black/red combo.",0
4.0,pretty great customer service,"September 22, 2017",Yes,"EDIT.So customer service contacted me after my review and sent me another pair! Haven’t had any complaints yet! Thanks again!..Bought these as a gift and they seems to like them but when I tried them on before I gifted them I found the sound to be muffled and not clear! Really dissapointed about that! They haven’t been used wirelessly yet but the wired part leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the sound. Still they’re built well, look very sleek and are pretty sturdy. We’ll see how well they hold up!",1
4.0,Great sound! Crappy microphone though,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"I really do love this headset! It works great, it keeps the sounds outside of the headset out and the sound is really good...One star less because the microphone is really crappy. When I use the headset for Skype or any other talk function, I have to use it with cord (in order to activate the computer microphone and use it instead, as people do not hear me well at all when I use the microphone of the headset itself.",0
5.0,"Sound great, comfortable and well worth the money.","May 16, 2018",Yes,"For $40 these headphones sound amazing.  I'm a live audio engineer(have mixed for many acts who's names you would recognize) and am very picky about what my headphones sound like.  I bought these because I wanted something wireless to wear while I mowed the lawn and thought what could it hurt trying them at 40 bucks.  I am beyond amazed by the sound quality, to the point where I may buy a bluetooth transmitter so I can use them when I mix shows.  They sound natural without any bass or treble boost, fit comfortably on the head and are easy to use.  If you're on the fence on buying these, go for it.  You won't be disappointed.",0
2.0,Charging port no longer works after charging only twice.,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"Worked well until it would not charge any longer. Seems to be mutiple things going on, the charging light comes on if it is held at an angle. But even after sitting at an angle with charging light on, headphones will not hold a charge. Thankfully this was still within the return window. Would NOT recommend.",1
4.0,What I was looking for- comfort,"May 31, 2018",Yes,Extremely comfortable which was my main desire. Over the ear for adult female. Sound quality is good for the price but if sound quality is your primary concern you will probably be happier with a more expensive pair that is well known for exceptional sound quality. I just wanted normal headphones that would be comfortable to wear for long periods I was unhappy with ear buds and on the ear headphones. Folding and blue tooth capability is a nice plus.,0
2.0,Obnoxiously loud voice function!,"April 17, 2017",Yes,"Something no one seems to be talking about but was a major negative in my book is that anytime you do something like turning the headphones on or connecting to blue tooth, an obnoxious voice function states it out loud for anyone in several feet of you to hear. Hard to listen to music in a library when turning my headphones on makes it go ""POWER ON."" Quite annoying, loud, and inconvenient, yet I never saw this ""feature"" in any review when I was deciding to buy! Well it is so annoying that I kept the headphones for a day before deciding to return it. Another thing I didn't like is the plastic top part feels very fragile and that if I were to overstretch my headphones while taking them on or off it would easily snap right in half.",8
5.0,Customer Service is excellent,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"Originally, I was sent headphones that gave off an intermittent background static noise. I thought that this might have been a common issue with bluetooth speakers. However, after turning off the bluetooth capabilities and listening through the wired cable provided, there would still be intermittent static noise...However, customer service reached out, and provided me with an alternate headset. This is why I am providing 5 stars for the review. Nowadays, very few companies stand by their products. As soon as something is sold, the customer is forgotten. However, the fact that MPOW reached out, sent a new headset, and stood by their product rather than forgetting their customer, was impressive. While the headset is solid for its price, I am more impressed with the service and would recommend purchasing from this company.",0
4.0,"Uncomfortable to wear with glasses, otherwise okay.","January 30, 2018",Yes,"There are a lot of good things about these headphones- for the price you get decent sound, the Bluetooth works wells, and I've had no issues with charging. I'm giving these headphones 4/5 because of comfort. I did not find them comfortable with glasses and they cause discomfort if I wear them for more than 15 minutes, and they gave me a couple fairly nasty headaches. I'm going to have to get my glasses re-adjusted because these headphones twisted the hinges a bit out of alignment. That's something to keep in mind if you're a glasses wearer...I have edited this comment after customer service reached out to me. They were very prompt and helpful. They sent out an alternative headset for me to try, which I very much appreciated. This headset went to a family member who enjoys the Mpow 059 very much and finds it to be a perfect fit.",0
5.0,Love these headphones!,"April 2, 2017",Yes,"For budget headphones, these are great! The plastic is glossy, giving it a very stylish look. I bought these after using Beats Studios for a few years, and the sound quality difference is not that noticeable. The cushion is not quite as comfy as the studio beats, but for the price, these are still quite comfortable! No Bluetooth connectivity issues with my Android phone and/or my laptop computer and I love that I can use a wired connection as well. 5/5 would buy again!",1
5.0,These are the best headphones we have used for the price and quality!,"March 29, 2018",Yes,I purchased these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them! We have gone through allot of ear buds and headphones over the years because they are not durable and she is rough on them because of her disability. These were very well priced and arrived on time and packaged well. She does not want to take them off and they linked right up with her cell phone and tablet. We will definitely purchase from the manufacturer and seller again!,0
5.0,Great wireless headphones. Easy to use features. Great Customer Support.,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"I love these headphones.  I kept waiting because I really wanted the Dr. Dre White Wireless ones but they cost $300 + and just could not justify that. So happy I waited now.  These work well and I like their colors. I may buy a second pair so I don't have to search for them when doing yard work...Also, they sent me a follow up email to make sure I was happy with my purchase. Made it easy to contact them if I needed anything. I appreciate this.",0
4.0,These work great and are very comfortable,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"These work great and are very comfortable. I go to sleep most nights with them on my head. The only drawback I see is this insanely bright flashing light on the power button. I don't really understand why the flashing light, but it's really bright.  Otherwise, they connect instantly to my phone and the distance is really good. I typically have my phone on me while I listen but have had my phone on the charger and walked around the house with little interference. Sound is good. I use them to mow the lawn with and can hear every word of my podcasts.",0
5.0,Great sound quality and even better price!,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"I run a travel website and often times when I'm flying, I'm usually listening to music, my podcasts or just even Netflix just to pass the time. So when my Beats by Dre headphones broke late last year, I knew I needed a replacement. So when I came across these headphones and saw the price, I knew I had to give it a try...I can honestly say that these are some of best the headphones I've ever had the pleasure of owning. They feel comfortable while wearing it, the sound quality is excellent, it's easy to store, and Bluetooth pairing is super easy. On top of that, the price is amazing. In fact, had known about this when I got my Beats headphones, I would've gone for this instead...In short, anyone looking for comfortable headphones with great sound quality at a great price should get these!",0
2.0,I plugged these into my computer to watch some videos ...,"March 5, 2017",Yes,"I plugged these into my computer to watch some videos. They worked perfectly for certain things but other things wouldn't work properly. I could hear the background music, for instance but no voice audio/etc. Netflix and youtube had the audio problems no matter what and they only worked properly for about 1 in every 4 movies (I tried multiple formats but didn't seem to matter) Unfortunately, I'll be returning these.",2
3.0,Sound is just...aweful,"September 2, 2018",Yes,"I'm honestly baffled by the positive reviews.  Maybe mine were bad?  They look great, feel great and have a lot of functionality.  The problem is that the sound feels like you got dropped into a pit.  iPhone buds blow these away.  No bass.  No treble.  I tried them with music and on my PC.  I thought there must be a button that has them on mute or something.  Nope.  Mine are going back.",0
5.0,Great set of headphones,"May 17, 2017",Yes,"Best $35 dollar headphones I've spent ever. These headphones are great. I've had them for less than a day but I was able to test the quality of them. Through wired connection the sound is amazing, good bass loud music. On Bluetooth the sound is a little lower and little bass. This is ok for me because I was looking for a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones. The headphones came brand new with charging cable, 3.5 mm headphone aux, and a very nice leather pouch.",1
4.0,"Great idea, bad sound quality.","August 31, 2018",Yes,"Bluetooth works fantastic, quick to reconnect, and can handle multiple devices connected at once. The folding feels robust, and doesn't feel like it will just break. The carrying bag is a nice one, and makes transporting these around easier. The controls are easy to use when you're not looking at them. Overall, these are mostly fantastic and the wireless part is a REALLY nice compared to wired headphones...The audio, however, is terrible. Too much bass, a lot of high-tones, and the mid-tones are just suggested at. It sounds like listening to someone through a wall. I also didn't get any manual or instructions on how to use these, nor could I find one on the manufacturer's website. It is mostly intuitive, thankfully.",0
3.0,Functional but below average sound quality and interface,"October 4, 2018",Yes,"These headphones do what I want them to do very well, which is to say, they work well as a cheap but sturdy Bluetooth headset I can use for podcasts and phone calls. However, the sound quality isn't great. The bass is really weak, and I vastly prefer $15 wired headphones to these when it comes to listening to music...Also, the interface is a bit clunky. There's one button used for: play/pause, voice assistant, on/off, redial, and pair/unpair, with the only difference being the length of the press. (There are separate buttons for volume up, volume down, forward, and backward.) I don't think I could reliably use voice assistant with these.",0
5.0,Very satisfied and do like the sound quality,"April 12, 2018",Yes,"I wasn't sure if they would pair with (Echo group) Alexa..And yes easily paired with Alexa and other electronics..The sound is very good. I did not want one of the emphasized bass type but a true representation of the sound..Skills via Alexa were easily understood and clear..Music played with my Fire HD8 and discussions brought in on Channels were just right, easy to understand.",0
5.0,This is a great set of headphones,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"This is a great set of headphones. We purchased this pair for our eight year old, they fit over her ear and she reports them to be very comfortable. While they are not noise canceling, she choses to wear them while doing homework to block out some of the noise.  The power button is the same as the call button so it does take a couple times to get used to how long to hold the button to power on/off vs. pair vs. make a call, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy to operate.",0
5.0,"Great sound, great price.","August 18, 2017",Yes,"Great looking headphones.  Great sound and very inexpensive.  My company shifted to Skype phone system.  I needed a wireless headphones during conference calls, whenever I worked from home.  This works very well.  The voice is crystal clear.  Party at the other end hears me well.  I is a great buy for the money.  We use noise-cancelling headphones from Planatronics at the office, which cost upwards of $200.  The voice quality is comparable to Planatronics (except no noise cancelling feature).",0
5.0,Nice. Very nice.,"February 20, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these headphones for my daughter and I borrowed them and was amazed at how great they felt.  I prefer over the ear headphones (old school) and I often have to adjust other pairs but with these, I did not.  I wear earrings in my upper ears and I didn't have to adjust thw headphones.  The sound that comes from these headphones is awesome, I am hoping my daughter doesn't need them any time soon :)",0
4.0,Pretty good.. but..,"October 10, 2017",Yes,"So here's the deal - I bought these headphone because I have a family, and my life-long electronics addiction unfortunately doesn't take a whole lot of precedence over diapers, food, and a mortgage anymore.  I also spend about 2 hours a day commuting by train and I needed something to help mask the sound of all the obnoxious mouth breathers, incessant snifflers, and folks who for some reason think its necessary to down a foot-long sub and smack their jaw with the ferocity of a famished hog.  So I ended up with these..Price?  Awesome..Build?  Sturdy.. foldable.. comes with a bag you can slip em in..Comfort?  I'd say good.  Soft on the ears, adjustable from firm to loose - but they do bite the ears a bit after an hour or so..Sound quality?  Meh.. I'm still not sure...Sure.. they sound decent for the price and for that I'd say try them out.. but don't expect to be wowed if you're an audiophile like myself.  There simply is no denying the audible difference between bluetooth mode and plugging the wire in which is what I was primarily concerned about from the get-go.  The sound is much, much fuller plugged in, which yes-I understand is normally the case, but its so much so that I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick when I'm wireless.  I know there's more sound in there, but it just doesn't transmit.  So I've found myself not really using them anymore and they take up a decent amount of real estate in my bag.  So.. back to the ear buds I go until the next adventure.",4
5.0,I’m picky and these get my approval,"October 3, 2018",Yes,"Easy to use, looks nice, feels “rugged”, and the battery life is awesome. Sound is really good. If you are right next to someone and the sound is high, they can hear what you are listening to.",1
4.0,Great bang for your buck,"October 30, 2018",Yes,Sound quality is great. Louder than average head phones. Kinda of bulky and the buttons can be a bit annoying to operate. Definitely worth the money though as I've had Sony and Bose and the sound quality is right there.,1
3.0,Sound quality isn't terrible. Slight rattle in the left ear at certain ...,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality isn't terrible. Slight rattle in the left ear at certain frequencies. No audio lag on Bluetooth. All the other reviewers must have tiny heads or kids. These don't fit my fat head very well, felt like they was trying to pop my brain like a zit. I could feel my heart beat in my head after about 15 minutes. Couldn't wear longer than 30..If you have a small head or are a teenager, these might be perfect for the price",1
5.0,I am glad I did,"April 27, 2018",Yes,I have had a set of Bose headphones for many years that finally gave up so I decided to try these. I am glad I did! These work great &amp; have very good sound quality. They are very comfortable &amp; easy to pair and operate. Would highly recommend.,1
4.0,Microphone,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"This is a pretty good headphone set for someone who just needs a pair to workout with or just use without breaking the bank. That being said I bought the headset because I thought I would be able to use the microphone to do some homework online. Turns out the mircrophone doesn’t work unless you’re making a call/talking on the phone. It’s my fault for not double checking but just letting y’all know in case someone was going to use these for the same purpose. Despite that little fib, this is a pretty affordable and sturdy buy.",0
4.0,Good Sound Quality; Minor Adjustment Needed,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"The sound is amazing and the ear cups fit nicely.  Only giving 4 stars due to during unpacking the headphones one of the ear cups was detached from the harness.  After removing 4 screws the plastic easily pulled back and I was able to repair the ear cup.  Other than the ear cup being detached, the sound quality is amazing and it quickly connected to bluetooth mp3 player without issue and the 3.5 mm jack is a nice touch when using for laptop.",1
5.0,She says they are very comfortable to sleep in and likes the noise reduction quality,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my wife a few days ago.  She says they are very comfortable to sleep in and likes the noise reduction quality. They aren't noise cancelling, but when I tried them on they are comfortable and outside noise is greatly reduced.  What I like about them is I don't have to reconnect them to Bluetooth every time we turn them on.  It connects right away to the last connection it had.  She has slept with them on every night since we received them and there have been no issues at all so far.  One thing to note is we charged the headphones fully before the first use.  They lasted about 7 hours the first night.  We recharged them and they have been lasting through the night.  We had a lazy morning where we stayed in bed for a while and I was reading and she continued to use the headphones, I would have to say they were on for 12-14 hours no problem.",0
5.0,Comparable to my Beats Solo3,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"Bought 2 pairs. I have the Beats Solo3, which I like but they press against the ear and become uncomfortable after a few hours of use. These are large enough to go over the ear. They also sound as good as the Beats for 1/10 of the price. These will be my traveling head phones, and I won’t have to worry about losing them or accidentally breaking them since the price is economical.",1
1.0,No longer connects via bluetooth,"August 26, 2018",Yes,"Initially the headset worked as expected, however about 45 days after the purchase the headset no longer stay connected to my phone.  Upon power on It repeatedly connects and disconnects 3 times before refusing to connect again.  I've tried multiple phones and the headset will not reliably connect to any of them...For $10 more I'd recommend the Monoproce Bluetooth headphones.",1
4.0,Works good with iPhone 7 Plus,"July 22, 2018",Yes,"Bought these for an upcoming road trip where I don’t want to listen to my family’s tunes the whole way. I’ve only tried them out once when they first arrived and I’m impressed. They charged quickly and were fairly easy to pair with my iPhone. It took me a few tries to get them to connect, but I think that was more me than the headphones. They sound good and the controls on the side were easy to use. We’ll see how they do on the trip and I’ll update with my findings.",0
5.0,Great product for money point.,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend, as he hates the separate piece needed for iPhone 8's to use headphones. He does a lot of cardio work outs, and listens to a lot of music while walking. He loves the sound quality of these headphones, that they stay snuggly in place while moving around, as well as the fact that these have a microphone function available as well. He has tried inside the ear, wireless ear buds and hated them. They refused to stay in place in his ears, fit poorly, and sound quality was not that great. These are a TERRIFIC product, especially for the money.",0
4.0,But I love that they are cordless (my first kind like this) ...,"August 31, 2017",Yes,"I bought these for myself after years of ruining cords on headphones. They were NOT straight forward to set up at all, actually. The sound was horrific at first, but I eventually found some random button on Windows 10 that magically fixed it. My boyfriend mainly uses them, because I find them to be way too tight on my head. But I love that they are cordless (my first kind like this) and I will definitely look into getting a different pair of wireless headphones now.",0
4.0,"Great sound, but heavier than expected.","June 13, 2018",Yes,"I bought these to use at work while sitting at my desk. They have terrific sound quality and I love that I can use them as wireless Bluetooth and wired. They also block out a good amount of outside noise. The charging light seems to malfunction and turn off after a few minutes even though I know it isn't fully charged. I took one star off because of the weight of the headphones. If I wear these for a prolonged period of time (longer than an hour), my neck begins to hurt. This doesn't bode well if I want to use them for a long plane ride or when I need to work on a project that is longer than an hour.",0
4.0,Good pair of headphones with some flaws. Exceptional customer service,"February 4, 2018",Yes,"Overall the headphones are OK. I’ve owned some other cheap headphones and these are quite similar to those pairs with some decent bass. However what disappoints me about this set is that trying to play after pausing on YouTube videos doesn’t work which is annoying (pressing the physical buttons on the headset). Additionally I have a somewhat small head so whenever I shake or jump it loosens and eventually slips off. But the ironic thing is that after prolonged usuage it actually is quite noticeable annoying and shouldn’t be like that. Overall it costs me AUD$47 which for its similar quality with other headphones in this price range and some minor annoyances is just meh...UPDATE: Fantastic customer service, they have tried to help solve my issues with the current headphones by sending a completely different pair? Well it’s very nice for them to do that but that still leaves the current issues ignored. Regardless an extra star for their valiant effort.",0
5.0,Why have't you bought these yet?????,"February 8, 2018",Yes,I honestly can't put into words how happy I am with these headphones. I've been looking for a good pair of wireless headphones that won't kill the bank. It gives off amazing sound quality and are so comfortable on my ears. Not to mention it's so convenient that these come with a chord just in case you forget to charge them!!! I will say after prolonged use my ears do start to ache a little but I usually don't notice until after I've taken the headphones off. CAN NOT RECOMMEND THESE ENOUGH! BUY BUY BUY!!!,0
5.0,Company has good service to quickly replace unit,"March 11, 2018",Yes,Update: company just sent out a replacement headset and we are happy with the new replacement headset. We didnt even ask for a replacement but they just shipped one to us anyway. Great service!..Original: There's a loose wire or something inside the left ear piece and if you move your head you can hear what sounds like a screw moving around in the earpiece housing. Too bad i waited so long to use this headphone that I now cannot return or exchange it for a non-defective unit,0
5.0,Wish I had not purchased.?.follow up,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"Only fair audio quality heavy on the bass .an EQ APP doesn't straighten it out. I CANNOT get it to pair with Samsung Galaxy Tab3 7.. That unit will not update above Android 4.4.2. . I think the build quality is pretty good the life of the battery is amazingly good but the tension is not adjustable and my ears hurt after an hour and a half...Well ...2 stars is now 4+.I have to say this seller cares. 4dsys after i wrote  my review, his model H2 showed up at my house, no charge.. so I have two MPOW now..H059 and the less expensive H2. To me the H2 is everything the H5 isn't. Maybe the 059 is defective.. H2=better sound, more comfortable. ...not quite as rugged build, and the H2 ergonomics are inferior but ok.The H2 i got sounds good and is inexpensive. Highly recommended. ..and most of all...sold by a very good business person.",0
2.0,The reason for the 2 stars is becuase they are not very comfortable. Suppose to be over the ear,"July 25, 2017",Yes,"Sound quality is a bit underwhelming, but I can deal with that, becuase I mainly use these for lifting and at work watching movies. The reason for the 2 stars is becuase they are not very comfortable. Suppose to be over the ear, but unless you have abnormally tiny ears, these will probably be a bit painful. Two stars not one becuase I mean, they are less than $40 so...",1
4.0,Pretty satisfied but,"February 24, 2017",Yes,"Pretty satisfied but:.1) excessively booming bass and less than crisp highs.2) Not comfortable over long periods (I have large, protruding ears, so maybe that's part of the problem).3) Noise cancellation is great for low hums and rumbles but doesn't really work for music and speech (ear pieces muffle sounds pretty well though).4) No noise cancellation when using 3.5mm jack (bypasses electronics) - can't stream wi-fi and use Bluetooth simultaneously (Android phone).",1
1.0,These don't work,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"These are the most annoying headphones I've ever used. I followed all the directions and gave them plenty of time to connect, but I still couldn't get through one song at the gym without the headphones disconnecting every 10 seconds. The sound quality was shotty as well. I was disappointed.",1
5.0,Unbeatable for the price,"February 26, 2018",Yes,"For wireless over-the-ear headphones, it's hard to find something that works as well as these for the price. I'm by no means an audiophile, but I thought that the general audio response is pretty good with solid range. Haven't had any issues, and have yet to completely drain the battery...Only caveat is that you're not supposed to wear them for more than 2 hours straight in order to let your ears breath, which isn't all that bad.",0
5.0,Great headphones,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"I am impressed by this set of headphones. The system is simple to use, connects consistently and is responsive to volume controls. The ear pads are comfortable and don't cause any pain from my glasses against my ears. The only downside to my purchase was the ridiculously short charging cord (20 inches). My wife also has a set and loves them, but her kit came with a hard case and longer charging cord.",0
5.0,Very happy with this purchase!!,"July 24, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my husband to use while cutting grass.  He loves them. His last pair of headphones were not loud enough to hear over the lawn mower and these are. The sound quality is very good and they are comfortable to wear.  Having the option of using them with the wire or not is great for when he wants to use them and they aren't charged. It was very easy to pair them with his phone. Great quality for the price.,0
4.0,... these for a few days now and they are pretty solid. Although some times when I wear it ...,"August 28, 2017",Yes,"Had these for a few days now and they are pretty solid. Although some times when I wear it for a few minutes, the top part of my head starts to hurt, since the band is constantly pressing down on it, even when I wear it at the max adjustment. Sound quality is excellent and the battery life so far is amazing. Had to only charge it twice after using it for two weeks. Pairing didn't take too long once you first set it up and after doing so, it automatically pairs with my laptop/phone. However, the buttons on the side of the headphones are a bit hard to distinguish while wearing them as well as seeing if they increased/decreased the volume. Also, it's a little off to have separate volumes for the headphones and the system you're using it on. Overall, good headphones for the price with some little nitpicks.",1
5.0,Amazing Headphones,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones! This is my first pair of wireless headphones (I normally just get the gummy kind), and I absolutely love them! The battery life is great, and I can go days without charging them. I use them at work on a regular basis, and work with a loud vacuum for about 1 hour. It is amazing but I can't hear the vacuum if I have these on with the volume up on my phone. I don't have to have it up to the maximum volume either. I recently purchased a second pair in pink and gave my old pair to my brother, and he loves them. Great quality and very affordable! Don't hesitate to get them; they're worth it!",0
5.0,"Good for the price, but some Bluetooth issues","July 21, 2018",Yes,"I have been using these headphones daily for about 6 months. By appearance, you can tell that these headphones are cheaply made, but the sound quality is impressive and they are comfortable. My only issue is with Bluetooth. Sometimes I have problems connecting to my devices, especially my MacBook. When I'm outside of my house, I use the cable instead of Bluetooth because of interference. Overall, I think these are the best option for the price range and I'm happy with my purchase. They will get me by until I can afford more expensive headphones.",0
4.0,Wonderful price and work great,"April 6, 2018",Yes,"Wonderful price and work great.  I use to listen to audible books while I'm cleaning.  I've used on a plane (doesn't have noise cancellation), but works pretty well.  Feel a little tight on my head so I deducted a star. To be fair, I have a big head.  For the price, I'm not worried about throwing them in my bad, luggage, purse, etc. They get a lot of abuse and still work great and don't break.",0
4.0,Decent for the price,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"For the $25 I paid (with a coupon), I really can't complain.  The sound is average, the battery life is great, but the material quality is, at best,  average.  When I move, there is this plastic ""clunk"" sound on one of the ear pieces from the looseness of the connection between the ear piece and the band that goes over your head.",0
5.0,Good quality,"January 10, 2018",Yes,It's a brighter color than I expected but I still love it.,9
5.0,Turned out to be a wonderful gift!,"August 11, 2018",Yes,"I researched headphones carefully, as I wanted to buy our daughter a good set of over the ears for use with her electronic stuff, &amp; she can be fussy about some things..She absolutely loves these &amp; uses them almost daily..Says they work well with her Samsung phone, aging desktop, etc..I am glad I bought her these. Nice to know they are getting used!",0
5.0,Best Bang Buck OTE Phones On Amazon,"June 14, 2018",Yes,"I have wanted a set of over-the-ear headphones for awhile now. I finally pulled the trigger on these and they have been perfect. I was leery about ""cheap"" headphones but they are great for their pricing. Are they Sennheiser good? No. But they aren't several hundred bucks either. These are wicked comfortable and there isn't any sound distortion with loud music or FPS video games.",0
5.0,Very pleased. They are noise-cancelling,"November 17, 2017",Yes,"Very pleased. They are noise-cancelling, but only while playing music. I purchased these because I have sensory processing sensitivity and I wanted noise cancelling for silence, as well. It does not cancel noise if you are looking for occasional silence...Sound is great and controls are effortless to use. I could pause my Netflix show (on my computer) from across the room using these headphones...Excellent purchase, especially for the price.",1
5.0,and he raves about how good they are,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"I take back what I wrote in my first review.  The reason they didn't pair was because it wasn't done properly.  The customer service was most generous.  She said she was sorry I had a problem and that a replacement was on its way.  I replied that I already placed an order for a wired set, and asked if I should return the replacement when it arrives.  She said, ""No, you can just keep or give it away.  I gave it to my nephew, and he raves about how good they are.  He absolutely LOVES them!  Thank you, Mpow!",0

The can both listen/watch what they want and I don't have to hear it and I don't have to worry about cords getting ripped out of the device..The excellent part, the amount of time that these stay charged is great! Charge 'em before getting on the road and 6hrs later after full nonstop use, they are still working. Quietest road trip ever!",0
5.0,I really like it!,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"Although the sound isn't as great as BOSE headphones, the sound is still fairly good. For the price, it does a lot more than I expected it to. Audio sounds a little bit distant when you use the headphones (almost like you have speakers a few inches away from your ears), but I really like that it's not too aggressive. The headphones themselves are really comfortable and I love that you can use it wireless AND wired. So, if the battery runs out and you can't use bluetooth anymore you can always just plug it in and use it like regular headphones.",0
4.0,Good for home use.,"August 31, 2018",Yes,Loud and battery lasts for weeks. Wireless part works flawlessly. Distance from your phone that itll work up to is probably about 15 feet.Comes with a cable to plug directly into your phone just in case it dies. The only con is EVERYONE will hear your music. Best for those days your cleaning your home and dont want to drag your phone everywhere with you.,0
4.0,My son loves these.,"August 23, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my son. He loves them. I haven't tried the Bluetooth functionality yet. He is eight and they fit him well. My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give these give stars, is because when you are unfolding them they kind of snap into place and will pinch your fingers if you're not careful. I was not careful. Lesson learned.",0
3.0,Good sound quality but leak really bad,"March 20, 2018",Yes,"For the price these are pretty good.  Good sound, very comfortable.  Biggest issue is they leak sound really bad... so using these at the office isn't ideal... everyone in my room and the rooms next to me can hear everything I'm listening to, even when they aren't turned up hardly at all.",1
5.0,"Even better than I expected, highly recommend","August 24, 2017",Yes,"I'm really glad I decided on these headphones. I wanted a decent pair, but I also wasn't looking to spend money on a super fancy pair like Böse. These are perfect for me. I wear glasses and these are comfortable with them. The sound is great, bass is better than I expected, and they're very convenient. They also look good, which is also a plus. I definitely recommend these if you want a good set of headphones but don't need something super elaborate and expensive.",0
4.0,Good product!,"October 27, 2017",Yes,"I had some initial problems with the start up and connection but only at first the time.  Now it finds the connection instantly..Of course I tested the range and it was pretty good and very stable. I also tested how long it would last before charging. Nice surprise there. I worked through the entire night so did the head phones...lol.The sound quality is good and you get a good value for the money. It is well build and comfortable..Most people will be very happy with the range of the sound level. If would have liked the option to make it a touch louder..That is the ONLY reason for giving 4 stars, instead of 5..Otherwise, the customer support is very attentive and friendly  and the product is worth every penny. Go for it!",0
4.0,The battery life is also great. I am able to leave these powered on ...,"August 23, 2017",Yes,"The sound quality for the price is incredible (I purchased these for about 35 bucks).  The battery life is also great.  I am able to leave these powered on at my desk for days before needing a new charge...My biggest complaint is the comfort.  After wearing these headphones for more than 1 or 2 hours, my ears get fairly sore, requiring me to remove the headphones altogether...Overall, great product if you don't plan on wearing them for extended periods of time.",0
5.0,Great headphones for a good price,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"Great headset, high quality music capability. It doesn't fully block out sound, but it does muffle which works fine by me. The headset itself is comfortable, adjustable sizing and not too pinchy on the ears. The only downside is that you can't answer calls in the headset on bluetooth mode, but that's not a concern for me since I normally use it for music instead. Great for traveling since it folds down small, they also come with a nice cloth case to protect the headset.",0
5.0,I 'm just so happy with purchase,"June 8, 2017",Yes,"I'm so  excited  I got  my headphones  today  from  Amazon  ,  I just  paired  with  my  computer  , I'm  going  paired  with  cellphone  soon ,I 'm just  so  happy with  purchase ,  will be buying  more  bluetooth  headphones .  It  came  with a bag  and plug  cord from  headphone  to  computer or  other mobile  device  , it  did not  take long  to  paired ,  i  got  the bluetooth 4,0  connector  from  Amazon  2 wks  ago  connect  and  paired  with my  computer,It took  a few mins  no  problem  ,  Just  so  happy !!!!",0
5.0,... to write the review but honestly these are the best headphones I have ever had,"April 18, 2018",Yes,I waited a bit to write the review but honestly these are the best headphones I have ever had. The color is super cute. I love I can adjust the volume and change the song right on the headphones. They are so comfortable and completely cover my ears. The volume is great. I actuallly had to turn my phone volume down almost all the way so it wasn’t too loud. I highly recommend these !! Well worth it.,0
5.0,Just perfect. I love them so much.,"July 7, 2018",Yes,"I love these so much. I actually bought two, but my first one got stolen. I love these so much that I bought it again without hesitation. It’s great for running and yoga, it doesn’t feel like it will fall off. It does feel a little bulking especially when exercising, but they’re definitely big, secure, over-the-ear headphones. The folding is convenient and the quality is great.",0
4.0,but they are decently comfortable and provide decent sound,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"Not for audiophiles or people with massive ears, but they are decently comfortable and provide decent sound, which is great for the price range. The best thing though has GOT to be the battery life... first charge and I've used it wireless for at least 20 hours and it still reads at 60%. Blows me away. Wish the foam was a bit thicker and large, but overall I'm very pleased.",0
5.0,Well made and get the job done.,"October 7, 2018",Yes,"These are a great deal and actually very well made. I use them to workout and for yard work. Given the great price I don’t mind getting sweat, dirt, water on them. They just work!  I mow in them with a John Deere Zero turn mower and they block out the noise pretty well. Haven’t used any with active noise cancelling so I can’t compare to that, but I like them.",0
5.0,Works great,"December 26, 2017",Yes,"The first one I received worked great at first, but then failed to reconnect.  I'd have to disconnect and reconnect each time I wanted to use it.  The company sent me a new one, and the new one is working flawlessly.  Sound is great, and the headphones are comfortable.  They really seal out the noise in the house.",1
5.0,"they work very nicely, people ask me where I got them","December 20, 2017",Yes,"I am always skeptical of headphones, but these have really lasted. For me, it's moderate to heavy use depending on how much I go out or how many chores I need to complete. Overall, they work very nicely, people ask me where I got them, and when I'm at the laundromat I can go across the average-sized building before it cuts out at all. Four hours for eight or more is very decent. If they break before my six-month expectation is met I will lower my review.",0
2.0,Not A Fan,"October 23, 2017",Yes,"I'm using them with my iPhone 7 and the sound quality is poor -- muffled cheap speakers.  Also, a friend commented they look like I bought them at Payless Shoes.  The price is really cheap so I didn't expect Bose, but I'm puzzled how they are number 1 on Amazon with all these great reviews.",1
5.0,Good for working out!,"September 25, 2017",Yes,"I needed some good wireless headphones for the gym. I was skeptical on purchasing these headphones, but I was pleasantly surprised! I use these to workout at I'm so in love with these. Stays in place while on the treadmill, but not the best if your doing any floor work (abs). If you're a female put your hair in a ponytail or top knot and you're golden! The sound quality is great, but the down side is everyone around you can hear your music. Noise cancellation is a plus, b/c I damn sure don't hear anyone around me which is perfect for working out!",0
4.0,Perfectly competent headphones.,"December 19, 2017",Yes,"Pros: it very rarely has connectivity issues, small &amp; light, wired mode is included, great battery life..Cons: squishes my ears, which can ache after a while (I have a large head and large ears), the announcer/helper lady is extremely loud and annoying when you connect/disconnect/turn the volume up to max...Plus, it feels pretty rad to connect them to my phone, listen to some mad beats, and go around walmart boastin' yer swag.",0
5.0,Connects and sounds great,"May 9, 2017",Yes,Finally wire free with this headset. Arrived on time and packaged well. Came with a travel bag and connecting cords. Connects to me desktop computer every time. Fits well and is not tight. Ears don't feel sore after hours of movie binges. Sounds great when watching movies and music videos. I plug it in every night after movies when done for the night. So far no problems.,1
5.0,Pretty happy with it. Great product,"June 3, 2018",Yes,"Quality for the price is pretty incredible, it comes with a nice microfiber storage bag and folds up into it. The look is sleek and I use it exclusively for when I fly. I'm not an audiophile, but the music comes through crisp and the lows/bass are balanced and aren't overpowering. I have no issues with volume. The microphone works fine for calls. The padding is excellent and I've gone on 4+ hour flights without issue. The battery life is great - don't need to recharge it in the middle of layovers...The only thing that detracts from over the ear headphones in general for me is I tend to wear glasses on my flights and the headphones push in on them against my head. However, haven't owned a pair that hasn't given me this problem...Overall, great product. Pretty happy with it.",0
5.0,Nice but tight fitting,"September 19, 2017",Yes,"UPDATE!.I was sent a replacement with another model by MPOW and I love it! It's not as tight as this one and the sound quality is amazing. Best customer service I've ever experienced. I highly recommend trying out these headphones or another pair from MPOW, you won't be disappointed :)..The sound is good and the build is sturdy but it feels really tight against my ears and it hurts to wear it for more than 30 minutes so I can't use it for extended gaming sessions.",0
5.0,Great for the price,"September 27, 2017",Yes,Husband loves these! Bought them for him so he could hold our screaming newborn daughter abd alleviate some of his anxiety about it. He now wears them mowing and working out as well. I plan to pair my phone with them if he ever lets me lol...Edited to add that he says he is unable to use these while on walks. Not really sure what the issue is. But he walks each night and says once he gets a little up the street the headphones fail.,0
2.0,Broke after a few uses. Very disappointing.,"February 10, 2018",Yes,"Headphones were great while they lasted. After using them a couple of times for 3 days, the power button fell out of its housing. Now we can't turn them on/off and the button won't go back into the housing. Extremely disappointed and not worth what we paid.",1
4.0,"Awesome sound, comfy &amp; stylish","May 6, 2018",Yes,"WOW did not expect the sound quality to be so great for the cost. I have excellent hearing &amp; can hardly hear any outside noise. I have a somewhat small head &amp; tiny ears so sadly these don’t stay on as well as I’d like but I think that’s more on me than the headphones. They also seem to have a strong signal, my iPhone tends to struggle with Bluetooth but it connects immediately to these",0
5.0,They connected pretty easily to my MacBook Bluetooth,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"They connected pretty easily to my MacBook Bluetooth. 30 feet is about right in terms of distance...sound broke up if I went too far from laptop. For the price, they sound pretty good. More importantly...a break from earbuds as others have mentioned. The earmuffs are a nice soft oval shape, very comfortable. My ears fit nicely. My review is about their sound, fit and connectivity for my itunes only. The instructions are funny to read.",0
2.0,"Get the warranty, you'll need it","July 15, 2018",Yes,"Headphones feel cheap but for the price its decent. On the plus side, they do last a long time on a single charge. The sound is standard. You can't travel very far from your device if your connected to the bluetooth and the cord that is sent is small and very cheap as well. After 2 months they are starting to break down on me. The button that powers them on and off fell off. Right now I'm trying to contact the warranty company but they are even difficult to get a hold of. I suggest saving the money to buy something more well built. Side note, I bought a gaming headset from the same company MPOW and again they felt very cheap. Luckily I was able to return those in time.",0
1.0,Not worth it,"October 22, 2017",Yes,Does NOT charge well. Company makes it hard to return. Not worth the money....AT ALLLLLL,3
4.0,As an amateur audiophile and musician I appreciate good sound reproduction,"October 20, 2017",Yes,"I was a bit skeptical about product quality and functionality in this price range. But honestly I was quite surprised. As an amateur audiophile and musician I appreciate good sound reproduction. While the bass is not going to rattle your teeth, it is substantial. The mid-range is fairly clear with a few levels leaning towards the tinny side. Highs and vocals are mostly clean. The construction is mostly plastic, but seems to be well made and would probably hold up well with normal usage. The ear cushions are very comfortable. Wearing the set for more than an hour or two can get tiring. But I find that's typical with most headphones, regardless of price range. These do not quite match the sound reproduction of my Klipsch head set. But the difference in sound quality between the two is way less than the price difference. The only issue (not a major one) I have with this set is the Bluetooth setup/paring. Depending on the source, it seems to sometimes take a couple of tries to make the connection. But eventually it will succeed. Overall I would have to say this is one of the better wireless head sets I have seen in this price range.",0
5.0,Best bang for your buck,"June 26, 2018",Yes,Great headphones for the price. Havent had any issues had them for 6 months so far. They are comfortable and sound may not be as good as some of the high end ones but it's still very good!!  Best bang for your buck in my opinion. Would buy again.,1
5.0,You can't beat the price and the sound is pretty good. I'm not much of an audiophile,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"You can't beat the price and the sound is pretty good. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I have had my share or headphones that sound like you're listening to music in an empty bathroom --  these are not that. Although the sound might be ""beats"" by overpriced $100-300 headphones, they are of great quality for the price. The buttons on the side work seamlessly and the battery life has been great so far. I bought these for my 8 year old nephew for his birthdays and he loves using them for his echo dot.",1
5.0,A great purchase!!!,"February 13, 2018",Yes,"I've had these for a few weeks, and I love them. I use them about 4-5 times a week for the gym. I was looking into buying Beats, but hated the price of them. So I looked into these, and I am not disappointed. These are  comfortable and super easy to use and pair with my phone. The range on the Bluetooth is fairly far too..I read some review that read that theirs had stopped working, but I believe they may have charged it with a charger above 5V. When opening the box, there was a bright yellow warning label to only use 5V or blow.",0
5.0,Wow!  Much better than I expected.,"March 11, 2018",Yes,"Great headphones.  They connect right away, offer great sound, and stay charged for way longer than any other bluetooth headset.  Now, I use these with my desktop computer.  I wouldn't be caught dead walking around outside with them on.  They block out all the ambient sound for me.  You might end up getting hit by a car if you are not careful.  For the price, you cannot beat these headphones.  Get 'em.",0
4.0,Great product for the price. Highly suggested!,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"So far after two weeks of ownership, I really have no major complaints. I spend a lot of time reading through reviews and the reviews for this product led me in the right directions. They have a really good battery life to them. I am constantly on conference calls and they are perfect for those calls. The battery doesn’t drain quickly and I have no fears of dropping calls. For music, the clarity and bad is roughly mid level, but still leaps and bounds above others for the price point. They are very comfortable over my large ears and I rarely his issues with discomfort. I ended up liking them so much that I ende duo buying a pair for my husband and our nephew.",0
5.0,2 Teen boys are HAPPY!,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"Purchased these for my two teenage sons and they love them!  They have mostly used them as bluetooth only and love being able to play an online game with their cousins and talk with them.  They both say they are super comfortable, no hot spots that they have complained about as of yet.  Would highly recommend for anyone.",0
5.0,Sound,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"I had Bluetooth over the ear earbuds for a few years.  I liked them, they sounded ok and stayed on/in my ears.  Then the wire broke and one hear piece was all cracky.  I asked for Bluetooth over the head headphones that could also be wired for Christmas.  I got these.  They sound so amazing.  The bass is just enough not too much, they are super clear, they are comfortable and even talking on the phone it is super clear for the other person.  They cut out almost all background noise (did not want noise cut out completely so that's a plus for me).  so happy with these.  Even my husband who is a sound snob likes these very much.  He is now asking for them for his birthday.  I like the carrying case it comes with so I can use it when I travel.  The fact you can use them wired on a plane as well is a bonus.",0
5.0,Best headphones!!!!!,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"Sound is very good, no static when moving. Paired up to my kindle fire perfectly and to my iPhone. Call came in with no problems except the person that called said they could hear the background noise better than they could me. But I won’t be using it for calls. I will be purchasing another pair for my husband!",1
5.0,... for about 6 months and they are holding up great. I bought them for my very,"November 2, 2017",Yes,"We have owned them for about 6 months and they are holding up great. I bought them for my very, not Careful, picky, 12 year old and he uses them almost daily for several hours and they are holding up great, he says the comfort is great and sound. They arrived immediately in great condition.",1
5.0,Peace and Quiet for this mama!,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"Can I just say that my husband is OBSESSED with these! I usually want to read at night and he likes to watch TV so I decided to buy these for him for Christmas.  He said the sound quality is great and almost feels like you are in a theater.  He even wears them sometimes when I'm not in the room just because he loves the sound so much.  I tried them one time and I like how you can control the volume but also, play and stop from the headset itself.  I purchased a set a few years back for my dad but they were the old school radio transmitted kind, not bluetooth.  I would definitely recommend these over those and I'm even thinking of getting my dad a new pair!",0
3.0,Comfy with caveats....,"July 27, 2017",Yes,"THE BAD:  If you have a large head (7 3/4+ hat size), this item is NOT FOR YOU.  The muffs are comfy but the headband will most likely be too tight atop your head. The ample padding on the band (which is firm and not soft) the makes contact with the top of your head adds to the band being too tight.  Also...the controls (functions) for the headset are difficult to see. No matter which color headset ordered, the symbols/controls/markings blend in with the background of the headset. These should either be dimpled to distinguished by touch and/or be a contrasting color (i.e. red on black, green on black, white on black) instead of a very dull gray on black. Now, most of the time you'll use the controls when wearing the headset. But there will be times you'll use these functions when NOT wearing the headset (i.e. pairing, charging, volume control, putting sound on hold, etc).  Lastly, because you can't distinguish volume controls or channel selection by touch, you could accidentally change the station while meaning to minimize volume...THE GOOD (and this applies to 90%+ of the population): If the control issues I mentioned don't bother you, you'll like these headphones. They are comfy and has good sound (but NO NOISE CANCELLATION no matter how high you have the volume set to your favorite song or video)...BOTTOM LINE: These headphones are going back to Amazon for the reasons I stated. But I think I'm in the minority. Most will like these headphones.  I will say that these are NOT GOOD to use when doing cardio. Perspiration accumulates quickly on your ears due to the muffs and also where the headband makes contact on your head; making it both frequent and sometimes difficult to wipe away sweat during a workout (earbuds are better).",4
5.0,Better than m50x dollar for dollar,"February 6, 2018",Yes,Worth every penny. I had some m50x headphones and returned them because the difference wasnt great enpugh between these. They were better but not 120 better. Ended up getting some sennheisers. But these are perfectfor everything in between. Must have for anyone who uses headphones.,1
2.0,NOT ENOUGH VOLUME,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"This is a great headset if you have normal hearing. The problem with bluetooth is all of the speakers, headsets etc don't have enough volume..WHY IS BLUETOOTH VOLUME SO WEAK?.Pairing is a snap, connecting is a snap, the controls on the headset are easy to use.",1
4.0,Loved it,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"After a little issue with my first order of this, the second time I bought this, the headphones came the day right after I placed the order which surprised me. I was a little sad that I had to charge it for so long before I could use it, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. The only problem I have so far with this product is the almost 4 hours I have to wait for it to charge if I want to use the bluetooth. That is the only problem. The microphone works way better than I expected, I've been told through my games that they can actually understand me, and in some cases my voice comes through crystal clear. I loved the sound cancellation, with my music playing through the headphones over my ears, I was unable to hear the annoying vacuum when I was cleaning. Very comfortable.",0
5.0,These headphones are perfect for night-time sleeping when one of us wants to ...,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are perfect for night-time sleeping when one of us wants to watch tv &amp; the other wants to sleep! Update: we’ve since bought another family member a pair- and works great for letting someone sleep-in in the morning, while the other, who is hard-of-hearing, rises early and catches up on the news in the morning!",1
4.0,"Great, except for when my hair gets stuck","January 24, 2018",Yes,"My hair gets stuck in the hinges of these headphones. If you've got hair more than a few inches long, this might happen to you too. Luckily you can bend it slightly to release the hair. Some headphones just yank hairs out of your head no matter what you do; these ones aren't terrible, since you can get them off without pulling hairs out, but I miss the headphones I had previously. They never pulled my hair...Otherwise, the headphones are comfortable and cute. They block outside sounds very effectively, even when they're turned off. A little white noise at a low volume is all it takes to block all distractions...I wish they had a longer battery life though. I plug them in every night, but they still start to beep at me if I work a long day. I don't really mind connecting them to the headphone jack, but if cables are your pet peeve, it's something to know.",0
3.0,"Good audio, no mic. Bad audio, with mic.","September 19, 2018",Yes,"Nice sound quality in headphone mode, love the color and style...These work as a decent pair of wireless headphones, but headset mode (headphones + mic) is awful.  =/ the pause/play and skip button didnt register for my PC, volume does. (Havent tried for my phone). Ultimately, i wanted wireless headphones just for music or solo gaming, and thats exactly what I got..",1
5.0,Great Headphones!,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"These work great and I really enjoy them. Sound is great, connection is sometimes difficult at first, but this is because of my phone and they are stylish. I bought one for each of my family members to use during working out.  I run with them on and they stay on fine. The only time they slip a little is when I'm doing any form of exercise where I need to jump or hang upside down (understandably).",0
5.0,My last Mpow purchase was really great - it was a bluetooth phone earpiece,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"Just had this for over a week. Used many times for watching TV. I purchased it because it was an Mpow brand and was on the Amazon Bestseller list. My last Mpow purchase was really great - it was a bluetooth phone earpiece, bought over a year ago, worked reliably well from then till now. Wanted to get a bluetooth headset for watching TV - THAT WOULD NOT HAVE INTERFERENCES (PAUSES) WHILE LISTENING. My prior (and only) such purchases (both Bluedeos) turned out such (that I purchased and used cable wires with both). So far, this works great, including connecting to the TV when watching. Looking forward to getting another one for mobile and PC use! . . . I noticed some sound lag watching shows on Amazon Prime, but it seems as though the same (lag) on TV speakers. (Hmm, TV, stream, or source?)",0
5.0,You get what you paid for plus MORE,"September 18, 2017",Yes,"It is very comfortable around the ears and has a good bass to it. Can take a call and mic can actually hear you speak so you don't sound distant or confusing to the person you are talking to on the phone. Has a noise cancelling feel to it when in Bluetooth mode. Comes with a gray soft case for your headphones and a charging cord(but no plug) and an aux cord just in case your Bluetooth dies, the music does not have too.",2
4.0,Mostly good.,"April 4, 2018",Yes,Very good sound.  Not too heavy.  Good at blocking out other noise (on airplane for instance).  Easy to hook up/use and good battery life...Only reason not 5 stars is that they are quite big/bulky.  Not comfortable to wear in the gym...they bump into too much stuff.,1
5.0,❤Great headset at an amazing low price!!!!! ❤,"June 4, 2018",Yes,"I absolutely love this headset!!!!  I bought it to wear at the gym and it's perfect. The sound quality is great, alot louder than I thought (I can't hear anything when I'm wearing them except what is being played through them) they don't slip or fall off my head while I'm working out and I do alot of strenuous physical activity and weight lifting. My husband tried them out and wants a pair of hid own for work so I'll be ordering another pair soon.",0
4.0,Great Bluetooth headphones for the price,"August 25, 2017",Yes,"I primarily use these for work (Webex, VoIP calls, etc) by pairing with my Windows 10 laptop. They are quick to connect and perform very well when compared to my previous wired headphones. I have a narrow head and wear glasses and find that the left side is painful when wearing for long periods (1 hour or more) but overall these headphones are very comfortable...The only feature I think is lacking is the ability to mute the built-in mic. The built-in button on the right ear provides the ability to answer calls and adjust volumes, but nothing for the mic. Webex does not provide a quick way to mute your mic through keyboard shortcuts so I would have liked a easier way to mute/un-mute without reaching for my mouse.",1
5.0,"it was great, because I can watch Netflix in the living ...","October 20, 2017",Yes,"I only had wired headphones. When I got these, it was great, because I can watch Netflix in the living room while someone else is watching TV. I also can get up at 3 in the morning and listen to my music on the computer while I check my email. I use them most of the time whenever I don't want to watch whatever the other people are watching on TV. I never tried the more expensive headsets so I can't compare, but for the price, I think these are great. Thank you, Rocky.",0
2.0,DOA - Really was interested in product,"October 16, 2017",Yes,"Mine was DOA in two ways.  Via analog only the right side had sound.  Via bluetooth the connection was completely unreliable and sputtered.  I'm returning now.  I really wanted to see if this product would match its reviews.  Now, to save time I'm just going to go for a more expensive name brand.  Too bad!",1
4.0,"Very good for everyday use, not very comfortable if worn for long times","August 2, 2017",Yes,"The pros:.* Very good sound quality.* Great built quality.* Long battery life (haven't gone battery low on me since I've purchased it).* Recharges extremely quickly.* Doesn't have problem with sweat (I mainly use it in the gym)..The cons:.* Maybe this is a problem with my ears but the inner lobe of my ear is oressed against the inside plastic part of the speaker part, which becomes painful if worn for a long time. The manufacturer advises to remove the headphones evey couple of hours though..* (This is a bit trivial) The audio control buttons do not have any texture or embossing to them, which makes me fumble a bit until I can guess the position of the button I need to press.",1
2.0,overall these headphones were a waste of money,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"If you're looking into buying these headphones I highly suggest that you choose a different pair of headphone as these are great in the beginning but a month later of using them the bluetooth connection between the HTC 10 phone and the headphones are really unstable. Due to the headphones and not the phone since I try the same phone with a pro headphones and the bluetooth work just fine. Plus the haedphones foam/padding is really hard making it really uncomfortable wearing them for long periods of time. Plus when you use them while you're resting in bed they make a lot of squeezing and grinding kind of noises, making it somewhat difficult to enjoy whatever it is that you're listening to. So in over all I have nothing but dissapointment and irritation for these headphones.",1
2.0,"Great for Listening, Bad for Meetings","October 20, 2017",Yes,"The audio quality while listening is great, especially for the price. My biggest complaint however is the microphone. I purchased these to use at work as I'm on conference calls for a few hours every day. The quality of my voice coming through is not good and most times people on the other end have problems hearing me. I've tried it with multiple applications (Skype, Skype for Business, Teams, Go To Meeting) and the result is the same.",1
5.0,"Comfortable, good battery life, with or without cord","May 6, 2018",Yes,"Got a set for my son so he could stop driving me crazy. They work with his iPad, my phone, his laptop, etc. They appear to have good battery life. I ended up buying a second pair for my mother who always has the TV on way too loud and they worked great for that purpose too. They can be used with or without the cord. Very comfortable. Really glad I purchased these.",0
5.0,Solid and functional,"June 1, 2018",Yes,"These headphones seem really great so far.  The sound quality is good, and the functionality is not difficult to understand.  I like that they can be used with Bluetooth or a cord, and that there is a microphone for talking on the phone.  They also fold up nicely and come with a carrying bag for travel.  I am looking forward to taking them on my next trip!",0
5.0,"Comfy, great sound, excellent battery life","January 6, 2018",Yes,"Great sound quality, a little bit bulky (they fit over the entire ear) but block out environmental sounds perfectly.  Love the option for wired or wireless.  Comfortable band for the head and soft on the ears.  Used roughly 45 minutes or more per day for the past 2 weeks and still haven't had a need to charge them.  They fold nicely for traveling.  My son wears a XL hat size and these did not squish his head.  Would recommend.",0
4.0,Comfortable BT headphones,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"Easy connection, decent distance, I'd give it 20 feet through walls. Easily cracked if dropped to many times. Quite comfortable to wear for prolonged times, even with glasses. The voice is a nice feature to let you know when it's on and connecting, love this feature. Also has auto power off after 10-15 minutes of no activity, awesome. Controls on side are useful when cleaning the house as well.",0
4.0,Great for the price,"September 23, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great for the price. The sound quality could be better, but it works. The battery life is great! I flew to Italy and back (charges for maybe 30 minutes in a hotel, just in case) and 2 weeks after coming home, they still have a charge. Comfortable on my head too. I recommend for a budget set of headphones.",0
5.0,Works great!,"April 27, 2018",Yes,I've charged my headset once and the battery is still holding up 3wks later. I have them synced with my phone and the range is great! It comes with a cord and you can use them that way as well. I also like that the space inside the headphones is large enough for my ears to fit without squishing them down so I don't hear anything but what's coming out of my earphones when I'm using them!,0
5.0,Great  Pair of BT Headphones under $45!,"May 10, 2018",Yes,"I wanted Sony headphones and the cheapest pair of wireless headphones I can find of their brand was about $80. I was close to purchasing them mostly because I'm a sucker for sony and my previous headphones broke. Now I need music when doing something productive around the house. Then I found these and the reviews were convincing. I didn't wanna buy a pair of BT headphones close to near damn a 100 bucks. I'm disappointed Sony couldn't offer something premium for a fair price like MPow. These headphones give you wireless function, great battery life, great balance between bass and treble all for under 45 bucks! Satisfied customer here.",0
4.0,More bass please!,"November 10, 2017",Yes,"I just got these today, I bought two because of the price, and makes a nice gift... Anyways They are awesome! Im Wearing them now jamming to music...Only one downfall..I wished the bass was a little better. I would have gave 5 stars, but I thought that 4 was good because they are pretty nice, and i can walk all around my house and still have music playing from my phone! For the price, I will not complain and I would buy again! Oh yea and Ive had them on now for about an hour and they feel great on my ears. Also, very easy to pair. No problems connecting!  Happy shopping!",1
4.0,"Great sound quality for the price, just a little chunky","January 11, 2018",Yes,"Good quality sound with a wide range of Bluetooth connection. Battery life is honestly unbelievable - I use these at the gym about 5 hours a week in Bluetooth mode and I've only had to charge them every couple MONTHS ( 4 times since I got them a year ago)..My only complaint is they are quite chunky and the headband part is not close to the head - not slim like other over ear headphones so the look isn't too flattering. However, they're high quality, functional headphones that I would absolutely recommend.",0
5.0,Bought 2 additional pairs for family members.,"August 2, 2018",Yes,"Great headset all the way around: impressive microphone, surprisingly solid range of operation, wear comfortably for long periods of time, clarity of sound, battery life...Great product !!!!",1
5.0,Incredible range. Works great with smart TV!,"February 5, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for use with my smart tv. I wanted something I could use for audio when watching movies late at night that didn't disturb other ppl in the house.. I was concerned that it might not have enough range for this purpose. I shouldn't have been. This thing streams clearly from 50+ft away from my tv, through walls, with no interruption whatsoever. Very satisfied with this device.",0
5.0,Great for people with giant heads like me!,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"Just got them today. Fully charged in under 4 hours. First impression? So much yes. Have been wearing them for an hour straight since charged and the first thing I noticed, were the perfectly proportionate ear cups. Seriously though, I wear an 8 and 1/4 hat and these things surpass even my ginormous head size...So far, exuberantly satisfied with my purchase. I'll update should the need arise. Happy shopping!",0
5.0,"Awesome headphones, Awesome price.","September 22, 2017",Yes,"Great set of headphones. They work perfectly with pure crisp sound. Good at noise cancelling, doesn't drown out everything(like if someone is talking next to you but kind of muffles it) but decent enough. The controls are really easy, pairing was super fast and it pairs with multiple devices. The foldable feature is great for putting it away when you're not using it and the squishy back piece feels nice on the back of the neck if you're pulling them down.",0
1.0,"Avoid, awful audio quality","June 13, 2018",Yes,"I'm not sure why the previous reviews of these headphones are so high...The sound is terrible, even when using EQ software to try to adjust. I found no EQ setting which could fix the awful audio...Bass overwhelms everything else. Also, due to the nature of the construction, body movements such as walking are transmitted by bone conduction to the headphones, so when you walk you hear thunderous footsteps mixed in with the audio...The clamp-on style of the headset is uncomfortable...The only good thing to say:  they do block out ambient sound pretty well.",0
5.0,Love my Bluetooth Headset,"March 7, 2018",Yes,"I use these mostly to help me hear when I’m on the phone in a noise area. The sound quality is very good.  I love that I have the option to use the WiFi or the cord - how versatile, and oh so comfortable.  I can use them on airplanes with the cord, and wireless doing housework or cooking.  The batteries last about 4 days with consistent use.  They paired easily with my iPhone, iPad, all I need now is an Apple TV!",0
3.0,was fine but they were too heavy for me,"June 4, 2018",Yes,"Quality, etc. was fine but they were too heavy for me. I started getting tension headaches. I regret buying them. I read a lot of the questions and if you have a fear of them being too heavy - do not order. Honestly I don't know if any over the ear will ever be OK for people like us.",1
5.0,"mmmmPOW! For the price, you don't get any better than this.","August 25, 2017",Yes,"The MPOW for a Sub-$40 headset is great. I use these daily. With a Bluetooth adapter on my PC I am able to use these for conference calls, music, and even Prime Video. With BT 4.0 there is no lag. Sound quality is significantly higher than expected in such a budget headset. I now have 3 of these units in use within my family and have had no complaints so far..You can pair these to multiple devices, but it seems like only the last device paired is the one that plays. Maybe they will fix this, maybe they won't. If I needed those features I would go to a more expensive headset. I like that I don't have to worry about these so much because of their price. I am not babying them like I would a headset in the several hundred dollar range.",0
4.0,Overall the headphones work fine but I have two issues that keep me from ...,"August 21, 2017",Yes,"Overall the headphones work fine but I have two issues that keep me from giving this product five stars. First, I use the headphones at the gym and I like to be able to increase and decrease the system volume on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Unfortunately the buttons on the headset do not match the functions as described in the manual..Second, the bass is a bit much on some of the music and there is little treble. I'm not sure of the best way to adjust this..Otherwise, I am happy with my purchase.",2
5.0,These are great!,"July 1, 2018",Yes,"The sound Is great!!  I was happily surprised. Also the headphones fit my head perfectly. The headphones can be adjusted for a larger head, just pull slightly on the sides and they get longer..I used them for about 3 hours and they are very comfortable as well..I wanted something to plug into my iPad and listen to music on YouTube. They are perfect.",0
5.0,Very Comfy and Sound Great!,"August 22, 2018",Yes,"It,s amazing that you can get this kind of quality sound for such an affordable price! Pair-Up instantly. Comfortable fit. Quality fit and finish. No lag-time for gaming! A real deal!",1
4.0,Not Bad,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"Everything has to qualified with ""for the price"", but in general, these aren't bad. Expectations have to be managed of course - these aren't high end gear. Reasonable sound quality, fairly light weight, good fit, good battery life, they isolate sound nicely. The weak link here is the sound quality via bluetooth, but again, the price. I'm using them for travel rather than taking an expensive set. As long as you don't expect too much, I'd say go for it.",1
5.0,A great value for about $40,"July 15, 2017",Yes,"A great value for about $40.  The battery performance is great.  The sound quality is great.  I use the wired stereo connection more than I expected.  The one feature that would make this perfect would be either a separate jack and cable for the microphone, a ""3-ring"" jack/cable like a cellphone carrying the microphone signal.",1
4.0,Great Bluetooth headset,"May 31, 2018",Yes,"Great Bluetooth headset! This is my first pair of over the ear headset so I don't have anything to compare it to. First off is sound quality. It's great for watching your Netflix or any other streaming of your choice, or even listening to podcasts. However, it's not the greatest for music. When volume is cranked up sound quality tapers off. Bass sound is still there but mids &amp; highs starts to sound bad. Comfortable headset. Earpads are comfy however if you got big ears these might be uncomfortable. Overall 4 stars. Definitely worth the money. Item shipped quick. Ordered it on a Thursday and it arrived on Monday (even tho Monday was a holiday).",0
5.0,Extremely Comfortable!,"September 26, 2018",Yes,We have short walls at my job and I needed headphones to keep down the distractions while working.  I could not be more pleased with my purchase.  I work easier at my desk playing soft music through my headphones without listening to co-workers talking.  They are very soft on my ears and the sound is clear.  Great battery life.  I would definitely recommend these headphones.  And I love the pink color!,0
2.0,Overrated,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"Just my opinion but these were a dissapointing purchase. It's not that they're terrible headphones, just not the best out there. Then again, I figured not to expect too too much from headphones of this price. The battery life is very good which helped. But I felt like the overall sound isn't as sharp and strong as I had hoped and to me the sound and quality was more faint than I had hoped for. These are very meh. If you're looking for beats quality, I'd suggest passing on these.",1
5.0,"Awesome, definitely recommend","February 19, 2018",Yes,"Like other review say, these headphones are amazing for the price. They're super comfortable, I use them for listening to music playing, video games, and watching movies. It's very comfortably over my ears. I can wear them for two or three hours pretty comfortably. Easy to connect with Bluetooth. The one con is that you can hear a little fuzziness, so the best way to avoid that is to make sure the volume is turned up on your device before you turn up your headphone volume.",0
3.0,"Not as good as I hoped for, but not bad","August 15, 2018",Yes,"I have a small head (wear a small motorcycle helmet) and I found these to be tight a bit. The ears were comfortable, but they felt tight on the top of my head. If I increased the sides, then they fell down, so that didn't help. They do not hide noise as much as I wanted either, but I do like the compact and lightweight aspects.  They are decent for the price. I haven't tried using the bluetooth aspect, as I only use them to travel on planes.",0
5.0,"Loved them so much I bought a pair for my son, too","February 21, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for myself and loved them. Great way to block out noise and distractions at work while I am writing. Then, my 12-year-old got his hands on them when he was home sick with the flu (and bored out of his mind for a week). He loved them so much he begged me for a pair. Highly recommend!",1
5.0,Covers my ears completely and sound is great. Great padding,"October 8, 2017",Yes,Covers my ears completely and sound is great. Great padding. Will be using them on a flight next werk so ill see how they work.......Used them on a 3 hr flight and im thrilled with them. Get these headphones!  Drowned out plane noise and sound of music is crisp. So happy with this purchase!,1
5.0,Great affordable Bluetooth headphones,"November 8, 2017",Yes,Decided on these because of the great reviews and super reasonable price. Have had them for around 2 months now and love them! Have taken them on 2 international flights and countless shorter flights and they have worked great with long battery life. They work great around my apartment as well but if I’m too far in another room the signal will start to cut out. Would definitely recommend for an affordable Bluetooth headphone option.,0
1.0,Disappointing - Quit Working,"November 25, 2018",Yes,Read the reviews and had high hopes for these.  Sound was good when we first got them.  About three weeks the sound started cutting out when using the wired connection.  It would fade out and would work sometimes when you moved the wire around but then stopped completely.  A lot for money for a few weeks use.,1
5.0,Great Buy and Great Gift,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are great headphones. Pairing the bluetooth was a cinch for both my computer and TV. I actually bought a bluetooth transmitter (TaoTronics Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter / Receiver, Wireless 3.5mm Audio Adapter at https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IV1H1ME/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5) that I can use with other devices.  I am thinking about buying another set of headphones as a gift. They are lightweight and sound nearly as good as my ""wired"" Bose headphones.",0
5.0,5 star for both the product and customer service,"December 20, 2017",Yes,"Bought this one July 2017. It works ok but there is mild background noise occasionally when I use the Bluetooth function. Since it already passed the returning date, I gave it a three star on my review. Seller contacted me and sent me a different one to try. This one works great! No more background noise and I am happy with the sound quality also. I upgraded to 5 star for both the product and the customer service!",0
2.0,Uncomfortable on ears after 30 minutes but sound fine.,"October 27, 2017",Yes,"Sound quality was very good.  Easy to pair.  Build quality was fine.  Folded nicely and came with a nice soft pouch..But, uncomfortable.  I don't have a huge head or anything, and after 30 minutes, my ears (outside) hurt.  Always trying to reposition them for comfort.  In the end I just decided to return them.",1
5.0,"If you’re looking for good quality and inexpensive, here ya go!","February 18, 2018",Yes,"I’ve been looking for headphones that were wireless and over the ear, and these are perfect, shipping took about 5 business days, sound quality is great taking into account I only paid 36 bucks! I have fairly large ears and they the phones cover my ears perfectly, as everyone has said the bass isn’t that great however I am just using them for the gym, I’m not sure how long they’ll last because I do sweat a lot at the gym but for the money quality is 5 stars! I will update review in some months to let you know how they are doing but so far I love love love love love them no sense in paying 200+ for headphones when these do the trick and I know that the description doesn’t say noise cancelling but when I put them on they do cancel out noise fairly nicely.",0
2.0,Terrible audio quality.,"September 24, 2017",Yes,"Light weight and Comfortable.  But clearly cheaply made and compared to my Avantree Audition's (which are available in the same price range) these sound terrible.  The sound is tinny and empty and bass is completely non-existent.  Clearly the drivers are under-powered for over-ear sets.. Compared to my Samsung Level Over's, these are basically garbage.",1
1.0,unusable,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"Super exaggerated bass.  Not high fidelity.  Music is almost unrecognizable through the thumping...An edit:  Patozon Customer Service contacted me and sent me an alternative headphone without charge.  Excellent customer service.  I am happy, and thank you.",1
4.0,"Nice quality, my kids love then, but can cause ""hot spot"" on top of head when used for a long time","August 22, 2017",Yes,"Nice quality for about $35  feels sturdy and well built.  Nice sound, comfortable on the ears.  I also like the replaceable wire (using it wired on a PC).  The only negative is that the top pad could be bigger or softer.  It can create a ""hot spot"" (irritation) on the top of your head when used for long periods.  I use aviation headsets when I fly and those are WAY better for long term wearing - but they are not priced at this level.",0
5.0,Good battery storage time,"August 26, 2017",Yes,"One of the things about wireless headphones that concerns me is how long the internal battery will last.  While it's easy to plug this into a USB and charge them, some of the time I don't want to have to remember to do that.  I have had these laying by my bed laptop for listening to audiobooks at night, for WELL OVER a week.  They are still charged up.  That's good enough for me.  The sound is excellent and the bluetooth connection works flawlessly.  I am happy with them.",0
5.0,So far they are great. As other people have stated,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"So far they are great.  As other people have stated, after a while they hurt your ears and head but maybe shouldn't have them on for so long AND they are under $40.  Let's see how long the sound and charge remain great...UPDATE: I can’t believe how great these are for the price!  Battery lasts a LONG time, sound is good.  Like many headphones, if you wear them too long, the pressure hurts.  On the flip side, I don’t want to take them off and that is why they hurt.",0
5.0,Very good,"November 25, 2017",Yes,"They're pretty good in general, but after wearing them for a while, the foam flattens, and your ears touch the hard surface inside, which can be painful. Maybe if the foam was thicker.....UPDATE: I raised one star to my review..It's true that it becomes a little bit uncomfortable after a while, but I do like it...UPDATE: I raised the rating to 5. For the price it turned out to be really good.",0
4.0,Great range and battery life,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"Great range and battery life. For people with big melons.... ""Depending on your head/ear size/shape, this headphones may be a little tight for someone which is designed to avoid sound leakage.In case of that and to get both audio and wearing comfort, please take off the headphone every 1-2 hrs to get your ears relax and protect them from lasting muggy environment in use.""",0
2.0,while these work fine with my phone,"August 29, 2017",Yes,"From what I can tell, while these work fine with my phone, but will not pair with either my Windows 7 laptop or Windows 10 desktop. I bought these as a wireless option for my computer, so while they are nice enough in sound quality &amp; comfort for the price, they do not at all serve the main function which I needed these for. Perhaps if they are meant only for mobile devices that they should be marketed more explicitly in this way?",1
5.0,Worth the money!,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"Good, clean sound. Battery life is incredible. Comparing to other headphones, these are pretty comfortable. Phone call quality is also quite good on both ends, which is something I was worried about...Ok, had to come back and add to the review. Now I know that headphones don't use up battery life fast, but these puppies are incredible. Used them for exactly a month almost every day without charging them.",0
5.0,"Easy to use. Bit of a sound delay, however.","September 30, 2017",Yes,"The headset talks to you to let you know what's going on. It'll say ""Pairing"", ""Phone 1 connected"", ""Your headset is disconnected"", ""Power off"", ""Power on"" ""Maximum volume"". The voice is female and sounds British. It's not unpleasant. There seems to be a bit of delay, I noticed this watching youtube videos. However I mainly use mine to listen to Sirius XM or music, so it's not an issue.",0
5.0,Comfort Fit and Great Sound,"April 16, 2018",Yes,"Received these headphones on time and as expected. Connecting instructions were clear and comprehensive. Once connected, sound of my music was clear and powerful. Sounds I wanted to drown out, ""gone!""..Didn't always need to hear about another's issues and problems. Let me workout or ride the bus in peace...Comfortable fit, easy to adjust and use.",0
2.0,Try looking elsewhere,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"Sound quality is decent for its price. The ear pads are comfortable, except they seem to fall on the lower portion of my ear instead of being centered. The worst part about this headphone is that it's too tight for my head. My old headphones fit perfectly when I first got them-- so I know it's not because I have a big head. The band on top is too hard which hurts, and the width of the headphone is too small. I did try adjusting the length but it doesn't really solve the issue when its tight width-wise. I tried wearing this for 30 minutes and immediately got a headache because of the tightness. When my friend tried it out they had the same issue. I'll be returning the product.",1
5.0,You can't beat the price.,"June 15, 2018",Yes,"The sound quality isn't the best in the world but you should know that going in. I bought this to be a cheap alternative to the higher end headphones. I was really surprised by the quality that I get from them. Also, no issues on phone calls. I work at home sometimes and use them for conference calls and no one complains about not being able to hear me. This was a great buy.",0
5.0,Love these!!,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"The battery charged up fast and it was easy to pair with the transmitter on my TV. I like to hear the full sound of my TV so I prefer using headphones. My old ones broke, these are WAY better than my last pair which broke inexplicably. These new ones are extremely better and more comfortable than my last pair",0
4.0,"Price versus value is good, meaning- is what you paid worth what you get","June 27, 2018",Yes,"Like how unit talks to you, ie.""You're headphones are now connected."" Quickest pairing and connecting I have experienced. Fits around, not just on ear, and quality of sound is pretty good-just not emphasizing bass like so many do today. Only negative so far: would like an audible beep each time volume is touched up or down because volume buttons are very close to main circle control button that you do not know if you have engaged volume or not.",0
5.0,I really like the headphones,"September 10, 2017",Yes,"I really like the headphones. I'll warn, they have practically no real bass at all, but they deliver exactly what I need, which wasn't listening to much music. I needed a cheap pair of wireless headphones to pair with a TV so I could watch without disturbing my sleeping wife. Good battery life.",1
4.0,Second set that I received works much better.,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"The first set that I received quit working in less than 3 months with very minimal use, but the company sent me another one and it appears to work properly. I will update this review in another 3 months. Audio on the first set that I received was not good, but this second one is much better, so I suspect that the first set was just faulty..Audio is clear on this second set, and sound quality is very good for the price point. Battery life seems to be good as well, as I haven't found where it loses charge yet.",0
4.0,and the Bluetooth works great - far better than any of my other Bluetooth ...,"February 12, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are very affordable, well-constructed, and the Bluetooth works great - far better than any of my other Bluetooth devises. The sound, however, is kind of muddy - like you're listening to something in a cave. It seems like the bass overwhelms the mid-range and high notes. That's not a deal breaker, but I'm glad I bought them peimarily for watching TV, not listening to music. Even so, the sound quality is okay if not great. I'll recommend them but with a few reservations, as noted.",0
5.0,Best Headphones on Amazon,"September 23, 2017",Yes,"This is the second set of headphones I have bought. The first was for myself and the second was a gift for a friend. After running through headphones after headphones and earbuds after earbuds I finally found exactly what I was looking for. I use these headphones for the gym, gaming, listening to music, and every day tasks. They are stylish, sturdy, and easy to find. I honestly can't say enough about them. Thank you for not pricing these out of my range. Superb product!!!",1
1.0,2 pair failed in less than 9 months. Each pair lasted less than 6 months.,"September 16, 2018",Yes,"Ordered first set for Christmas present. USB Charger port failed in May.  Ordered second pair in May, At the beginning of August the Right head phone quit working in Bluetooth mode. Headset worked fine with Audio cable. Makes know sense. Sept 16 Left head phone quit working with the Audio cable.  Mono Headphones don't cut it.",2
5.0,"great battery life, comfy","March 3, 2018",Yes,bought these for my husband. he's very happy with them. sound is great and they're comfy AND they look cool. so far he's only had to charge them once and keep using them day after day. he turns them off when he's not using them. i'm kinda jealous lol oh and I can hear him clearly when he uses these to talk to me. all around awesome product. no complaints. came quick too! thanks!,0
5.0,Got a used item instead of new/ UPDATED,"February 13, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE: changed my rating from 3 to 5! Best headphones I've had. Use it daily on workouts. Despite my initial review, it still works excellently and when I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong hence the update...Like the title said, the headphones came used from the obvious wear and tear. Even the packaging was jacked up. However, the headphones works fine. So a little Lysol, and I suppose it's fine. But to be clear, I did NOT order a used item and I'm disappointed. I guess i can return it and get a refund but i really need one for an upcoming trip.",0
5.0,good sound,"May 27, 2017",Yes,"Saves our marriage.  We had Bose headphones that plug into TV, new TV no plug in.  These have decent sound, he can adjust sound level, and I don't have to hear the TV..update:  bouth 4/17 now 2/20/18 and only working intermittantly, had bought square trade they have made it exceedingly difficult to use do not bother buying...5 28 18  They replaced the intermittantly working headphones of their own volition, I am surprised and grateful.  Thanks, Maxine",0
3.0,The sound quality....The reviews?,"March 24, 2018",Yes,"Got these yesterday and overall theyre okay. The Bluetooth is nice. The design is good. The sound quality...Not impressive, at all. Expected a bit more unmuffled sound,  but got muffled sound. It's a shame when the sound quality is better with 5&amp;below headphones. The setup is simple. Overall, okay headphones. Not worth the 36 I spent, more like 15-25... Not sure why the reviews rave these headphones..Did not test mic, will update when I do.",0
1.0,Arrived broken. Sound cuts in and out. Cheap ...,"November 15, 2017",Yes,Arrived broken.  Sound cuts in and out. Cheap.,3
1.0,Junk.,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"Problems right out of the box.. charged them up to begin with via a USB wall outlet (ie a wall receptacle that has a built in USB port). Even after 1 hour of charging and the red light going off, they didn’t work. Pairing via Bluetooth was a pain and they wouldn’t work with my laptop even with the cord supplied. Quality feels like cheap, junk. Definitely not happy, but you get what you pay for. Straight to the garbage..I won’t even waste the energy returning them.",0
5.0,Great low / no latency sound for video,"January 21, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are amazing! I went through several bluetooth headphones attempting to find a pair that worked well with my bluetooth transmitter and video. These were the first reasonably priced headphones that provided latency free (or at least unnoticeable latency) sound for my video...The sound quality is great! It provides decent bass without sounding hollow and crisp highs. The do cancel noise well and are very comfortable...I typically plug them back in for charging when I'm finished using them, so I don't know how long they really last. I've used them for up to three hours with no issues...The controls on the side of the headphones are very convenient to operate. The only annoyance at all is the flashing of the lights. When watching movies in low light, the LED flashing can be a bit distracting / annoying, especially for others in the room.",0
5.0,Nice Headphones!,"July 19, 2018",Yes,"I'm not a headphones expert but these are nice for the price. They connect to my TVs bluetooth automatically. On my phones bluetooth they also sound very good too. They sound very clear and plenty enough loud for me. They charge up pretty fast, and the charge last very long so far. I don't think you can beat these for the price!",0
2.0,Everyone can hear what you're listening to,"August 16, 2017",Yes,"I bought these to use at the office, but when I tested them out at home after I received them, they leak sound like crazy. My wife could hear every word from several feet away at a normal volume. They sounded good, but I don't want my whole office hearing what I'm listening to.",8
4.0,If you like Beats you will love Mpow,"August 9, 2018",Yes,Sound quality great. Very loud. Fold and collapse with carrying bag. 3.5 audio jack and cable. Bluetooth pairing. Call quality is very good had only one call but they could hear me walking but not traffic. These are virtually sound proof. Button power very similar to Beats to me that's a minus cause on Beats that breaks first. I say so far 4.5/5..Best Pro: Sound proof.Worst Con: power button will break( should have gotten the extended warranty).Value: Best value on the market right now even better than the Urbaner a couple years ago.,0
5.0,An awesome purchase!,"June 27, 2018",Yes,I love that I can connect the headphones either way. My favorite is wireless!! Very comfortable and the fit is amazing. I have a small head and without having to extend them at all they fit my head!! Sound quality is great. Easy sync up to my phone. Which you can sync up to two devices!  Kinda wish I bought these a long time ago. The price is awesome for these!,0
5.0,Excellent headset for the price!,"October 4, 2018",Yes,"works perfect and is very stylish, I use them as cheaper alternative to the more expensive ""gaming"" wireless headsets out there and works just fine. The only downside for me is that the bass doesn't have that oomph that a more expensive headset would have but again it does the trick for me, they're comfortable and the battery lasts a long time. Happy with my purchase.",1
4.0,I love the sound quality and all that,"October 20, 2018",Yes,"So here is my deal with these. I love the sound quality and all that. After a few weeks though the ear pieces move a lot more ..uh...wiggly I guess you would say. I use these for writing, so sometimes I wear them for hours. The head piece I have to adjust after awhile cause it begins to feel like pressure from the padding. These are still good for the price and I'm not regretting them at all!",0
3.0,Sound quality is a no no...,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"Very comfortable to wear; but the sound is not too good. I already lowered my expectation as these headphones are just about $40.00; and I knew they would be no way better than my $140 Sony bluetooth headphones. But still... the sound quality is just unacceptable. My $47 Hesh 2 wireless headphones has the same sound quality as Sony's. I can't believe so many people like these headphones for it's sound quality. Next time I will stick with the name brand that I know, or at least I need to hear the sound quality at a retail store before making the purchase. Once again, I learnt not to trust 100% other users' reviews!!",0
4.0,They also hold a charge and stay charged for a nice while - I would say a whole day or ...,"March 14, 2018",Yes,Very surprised at how well these turned out. They also hold a charge and stay charged for a nice while - I would say a whole day or more before I have to recharge them. Removed a star because they are not 100% noise cancelling and because the toggles on the side to turn on and off sometimes unpairs the phone from the device instead of turn off. Outside of that - I love these. I feel like another purchase is in the future.,0
5.0,Good value. Easy to set up,"July 14, 2018",Yes,Good value. Easy to set up. These are a bit bulky... meaning if you rest/lean you head back on a pillow/couch your side to side head movement is limited but these units are very comfortable (not too tight or lose). Good padding around the ears and top of head. I found the ability to fold up more useful than I thought. Charge lasts a long time and the distance I can walk away w/o disconnecting is plenty.,0
5.0,Would Recommend to anyone,"November 14, 2018",Yes,These headphones work perfectly. I use them at the gym and they are perfect. They fit great and stay put no matter what I am doing at the gym. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is great for the price.  The battery lasts longer than any other bluetooth headphones I have owned. Connects easily to phone. I highly recommend these headphones if you are looking for something that works great and is at a cheaper price point.,0
5.0,Awesome pair of headphones,"August 10, 2018",Yes,"This are comfortable and sound fantastic. For the price I paid, I am probably going to get a pair for each family member..I left the above review a week or so ago. I have since used the headphones a lot and I am even more pleased than before. I have yet to recharge the battery yet. its says its still 80% full when I look at in my blue tooth settings. If I could I would give them 6 Stars",0
5.0,Better than expected!,"April 16, 2018",Yes,"I wasn't sure what to expect out of these for the price, but I am pleasantly surprised!  Seem well made, and they are extremely comfortable over my ears!  They are probably not ""audiophile"" sound quality, but really good in my opinion.  I do use them while working out, so I am a bit concerned that my sweat will damage them at some point.  However, so far so good!  They also paired up very easy to my Iphone.",0
3.0,"If your a sound freak, don't waste your time. If you can live with a lack of sound quality. Then these are great.","March 16, 2018",Yes,"For the price. You cant go wrong. They are comfortable, they charge easily. The controls are easy also. The sound for me was beh. I was looking for something a little more. Sometimes you find a diamond in the ruff. I was hoping they were these, but they were not. If I wasn't such a sound freak, I probably would have kept em. For the budget minded. Cant go wrong. I returned them.",0
5.0,Great sound for a great price,"September 30, 2017",Yes,"Great sound for a great price. I have 6 kids and when I have these on and am listening to music at a normal (not high at all) level, I still don't hear the kids playing. They feel sturdy and should last for quite a while. I love that they're wireless or wired. I can listen to my stuff wirelessly but I can plug into the plane for in-air entertainment on 10-hour flights when I get bored of my own stuff. Definitely worth the money.",0
3.0,Update: FALLS APART IN 3 MONTHS,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"Update.Once I posted my original review which you can see below- the seller reached out to me and sent me a new pair of headphones. The seller was very courteous and responsive. The new pair is working, but the volume on this pair is very low, much lower than the first one, I struggle to hear when I'm using it for calls. However, I appreciate the effort the seller put in to send me a new pair of headphones...Original Review.This product was good at first.... then everything went down hill. Beginning at two months in the blue lining at the top of the headphones started lifting up. 3 months in the blue lining has completely peeled off exposing a white cushion- now only ONE side of the headphones work. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this product.",0
1.0,Stopped turning off!,"February 28, 2018",Yes,I’ve tried to enjoy these but they are so bulky! They won’t turn off anymore and I’ve owned for a little over a month!,2
5.0,I Really Like These,"January 3, 2018",Yes,"Normally I’m a higher end guy but decided to try these lower priced headphones. Have to say I’m overly happy with them. Easy to synch, comfortable, stay on during moderate exercise, sound great, great bluetooth distance, comes with a storage bag.  No complaints and the only thing that could be better would be a zipper case...but thats only $8 more. Great value and would recommend to all but the most descrinating audiofile.",0
3.0,Can’t wear them around people-But GREAT company,"March 5, 2018",Yes,"Good sound quality but those around you can hear EVERYTHING. I only use them at home when I’m alone..UPDATE: The company did send me a replacement pair, an upgrade that is much better and others cannot hear noise. The company was extremely nice in reaching out to me and offering a replacement to make sure I was satisfied. While this particular item didn't meet my requirements, I would not hesitate to order from the company again.",0
4.0,These are comfortable for a normal period of wearing,"July 26, 2017",Yes,"These are comfortable for a normal period of wearing, though wearing them for much longer than a couple of hours may become tiresome.  Not sure if that is a review of these in particular earphones, or of all bluetooth overear earphones.  These have a slight 'static' when they 'engage' before playing music.  It has a slight whine whenever anything is playing, it more noticeble(thought still just slightly) when listening to audiobooks.  It sounds like you are 10 walls away from an airplane engine, if this is any description that means something to anyone.  These are great as throw around headphones as they work as described and have a good battery, but if you are looking for bass or clarity, you will want to look elsewhere...Overall, I like them, but in a quiet room, I might reach for a different pair.",0
5.0,You'd be surprised!,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"These are actually amazing for the money. I listen to metal (old school to modern and everywhere in between), and these sound really good. I wouldn't pay a hefty price for them, but for less than $40, they're great. The battery actually lasts an extremely long time and they're really comfortable (fit snug around the ear) so I can wear them for a long time with no issues. Definitely recommend these.",0
5.0,Excellent for the price.,"October 16, 2017",Yes,"Got these for my teenage daughter when the Beats she got for Christmas died after one year. She loves them. They might not have the base that the higher end wireless headphones have, but the sound quality is good enough. I've caught her dancing around in her room thanks to no cords on more than one occasion. Makes me smile every time. Totally easy to connect to your Bluetooth and intuitive to use. Definitely worth the money.",0
5.0,Worth the money,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"I love them, I prefer to have music going when I'm working at the computer, but others don't exactly enjoy listening to what I list to, thus I put these on and work away.  Only problem is that I get carried away and start to sing....  I was worried about them being comfortable, which they are and they aren't sound proof, which is also good.  Worth the money.",0
5.0,"Great product, Get yourself a pair,","September 24, 2018",Yes,"These mpow bluetooth headphones connect and control wonderfully. They have never run completely low battery. The only qualm that I have, is that , when controlling their features with the buttons on the set, it is easy to press the wrong button,, bc there are no indicators (by touch)..I love these headphones. They are the only pair that --under $75--- are worth buying..It took 10 or more songs to break them in... some songs the bass currently sounds great on, and others, you are aware that they were budget headphones, but still sound great.",0
4.0,"Awesome choice for the price, can't go wrong","January 31, 2018",Yes,"For the price these cost, you can't go wrong!  They have solid sound, great bass and cut out surrounding noises very well.  The only thing they could improve is one of the joints where the headpiece joins the ears.  On the other hand for the price they are, you can probably just get a new pair!  The earpiece is definitely large enough to go over your ears and i love that it comes with a cable to use when no bluetooth is available.",0
4.0,excellent at this price point,"October 17, 2018",Yes,"bought these for my kid, so she'd stop borrowing my wife's more expensive headphones.  i must say the sound is pretty good. the fit and comfort are also good. would recommend. i like the fact that there is no active noise cancelling.  i don't have to yell the top of my lungs to get her attention when she has them on.",0
5.0,Won't Disturb Household,"August 30, 2018",Yes,There is another person in the house now with a tv. One agreement was that we each get headphones so as not to disturb the other with our different preferences for television shows. They work great and were easy to set up. They have never run out of battery charge in use. Can crank up the volume and not bother the other person. Very pleased.,0
4.0,... wish it had a battery life indicator and a better method to control volume,"February 16, 2018",Yes,"Works well but I wish it had a battery life indicator and a better method to control volume. The volume control has virtually no tactile reference so that it is difficult to know if you are pressing the correct area to raise or lower the volume. The volume could be a bit louder for me as I have diminished hearing. For a person with normal hearing, this headset should be fine.",0
3.0,Do not buy expecting to make use of the microphone,"September 7, 2017",Yes,"In terms of just being over ear headphones, these are really good quality (5-star). If your goal is to enjoy the quality of the headphones while also using the microphone, then they fall completely flat (1-star). The sound quality from any source while the mic is active reduces to a tinny phone quality. In this regard, as a headset, this is not the right product for gaming, taking phone calls, or video chatting. As a simple bluetooth pair of headphones for listening to music or TV, they are great value. As long as you are aware of this when you buy, then you won't find yourself disappointed.",1
5.0,Defective,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"I purchased this about a month ago and after a week or two the right side started to be weak in sound and eventually lead to no sound. Sometimes I can get the sound back by turning the Earpad around. This happened when I was still testing it around for sound and see how the mic performs, so I didn't even get a chance to properly use it before this happened. I was counting on this headset since it has so many good reviews and I may just have been unlucky and a got a faulty one. Otherwise, I do think its a good product!..Edit (09.30.17):.They sent me a new one and after a week or so testing, this one seems to work just fine. Great service and thanks again!",1
5.0,I'm now a believer in these reviews,"October 25, 2017",Yes,I read and how much they loved these headphones and I was definitely a skeptic but I purchased about three or four different headphones off here that were top rated and these blue all the other competition out of the water. I guess the only knock would be that there is one other one out there that has better battery life but for the price I mean what do you expect you can't win at everything with that price.,0
5.0,Great Sound!,"April 14, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable and the range on the bluetooth is fantastic.  Best thing to have when you want to listen to your own choice of music etc.  Easy controls on the head set so you don't have to be close to your source to turn down the sound or stop the track. I see presents in the future.  I haven't hooked it up to my phone but it's supposed to answer calls,",0
5.0,"Extremely useful and reliable, and sounds really good.","October 29, 2018",Yes,"I needed some Bluetooth headphones, never had any before. Previously had some pretty crap ones, and I decided to get a chunk of money to buy these and I do NOT regret it at all...Probably the best thing about these other than the sound quality is the battery life. Fully charged, these things last days, sometimes a week or longer, even without turning them off. They turn themselves off after a good amount of time as long as they're disconnected..There's really not much to say here. They're pretty comfy around your ears, it has buttons for play/pause, skip/rewind, and gives you a warning when it's low on battery or when it connects/disconnects. It's exactly what I wanted. Works on every device I own.",0
5.0,An amazing value. These headphones fit well over my head,"March 6, 2018",Yes,"An amazing value. These headphones fit well over my head. (Big head) and are comfortable enough to wear over a long period of time. I bought these for working out in the gym and they have done well in blocking out outside noise and awful music in the gym. These are light enough to wear for running on the treadmill, I run at a pace of 5 miles per hour. The sound quality is pretty decent for the price that you pay. I have other wireless headphones that go up to the $200 price range and these have faired really well in comparison. Still to early to tell in terms of durability, I’ve only had it for 2 weeks. Otherwise,  I would recommend it to friends and family.",0
2.0,extremely poor sound quality,"September 16, 2017",Yes,"Two stars only because they were comfortable. They had extremely poor sound quality: hiss, low volume, and distortion. I suppose if I was only listening to loud music they might be okay, but I listen to speech, video, and classical music as well, and they just didn't cut it for those things. Returned immediately.",1
4.0,Just as good as the higher priced headphones!!!!!!!,"April 23, 2018",Yes,"These headphones has surpassed my expectations!! The battery life is above average and long lasting!.As a added bonus the built in mic is nice for phone calls. Not the greatest Bluetooth mic in the world, but hey we are talking headphones here. The over ear foam is comfortable within reason of 3 hrs of continued use. There not noise canceling, but it good to be aware of surroundings environment. Comes with nice carrying bag (headphones fold up nice) and cord for plug in situations. Worth the money to try before spending hundreds of dollars on name brand such as Beats or Bose. You can even pick the color that suits your style!!.Would have gotten five stars, but the mic could be improved and the full charging time can be extended.",0
5.0,"The sound is great, people can't hear your music until you remove ...","April 8, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have scarily long battery life! I haven't charged mine in months and whenever I choose to go cordless, I am honestly shocked that they are still going. Mind you that I have been using my cord a fair amount during these months. Without a cord use, it lasts a few days of heavy use. The sound is great, people can't hear your music until you remove them from your ears, then they are practically speakers! 10/10 would buy again!",0
2.0,Disappointed.,"April 7, 2018",Yes,"The MPOW 059 checks all of the boxes for a decent wireless headset at this price. The audio quality and noise-cancelling are impressive, and while they are a little bulky, they are visually appealing. BUT after 2 months they are already on the fritz, they will disconnect randomly and shut off (I tried it with a full charge across different devices-same issue). Another problem is the loud voice that indicates ""POWER ON""/""POWER OFF""/""PAIRING"". It doesn't matter what volume you are listening at, this will be LOUD. So while this is a good headset, I would return them for the connection problems and the jarring voice commands...Update 04/15/18: Excellent customer service from this company, they sent me a replacement right away. Hopefully the connection issues will be resolved, I will update this review after some use.",0
5.0,but the sound is fantastic for music and podcasts,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are fabulous for the price. You do have to keep your phone near while using them, as the Bluetooth signal can cut in and out. The headset is difficult for answering calls, but the sound is fantastic for music and podcasts. I wear them to mow, and I can hear my music perfectly--and they also cancel out the noise of the machine.",0
1.0,Over all Performance,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"No Sound, Poor syncing to other devices. and lastly poor battery life... But it makes a pretty head set the marksmanship and design is very attractive. If that was all you needed But sadly NO?? I can't use what I can't hear with or sync to .And the other downfall about it all is that they don't stay sync to your devices. Even when or if you get them to stay sync. Not with mine anyway! The biggest fault with these is the charging and battery life! It's the worst! So all in all I would not and can not recommend these!",0
1.0,"Terrible sound, otherwise great headphones","October 22, 2018",Yes,"With all of the five-star reviews, I thought I'd be safe with this purchase. The headphones look amazing, feel amazing, have a rechargeable battery and are wireless with an optional audio plug-in jack -- which I love...However, the sound quality is atrocious -- as another reviewer put it, the bass is turned up and the treble is turned up, and the mids are hardly present. The result is that music sounds muddy and weak and you get that annoying 'hiss' sound with symbols or when people pronounce their s's...I would've kept them if the sound quality matched that of my previous broken headphones..All in all, the headphones had great quality of life, but as for the sound, they did not serve their purpose.",0
5.0,Good product,"October 29, 2017",Yes,"Package was delivered on time, headphones are great.  Fit well, good sound, good value.  Range is good, too.  So far, the range is 70ft., with walls and closed door between headphones and source.  I am curious as to maximum range; will be sure to test that.  They are also more comfortable than I had thought they would be.  Wore them for six hours with no problems.  They are near-perfect, especially for the price.",0
5.0,"Fantastic sound, Easy to use, Comfortable, Great Price.","February 20, 2018",Yes,"Where do I start? Low cost, light, comfortable, they do everything under the sun. Skip threw songs, answer phone calls, my favorite reject phone calls. 33 foot range I left my phone in the other room and still could navigate threw the song list crystal clear sound. Now bass on the other hands not very strong. I mean there is bass but its not thumpin like a subwoofer in the trunk of a chevy monte carlo. I bout them mostly for ham radio use and music. So they work for me just great.",1
4.0,"The mic is bad, so quiet that I thought I somehow had ...","April 4, 2018",Yes,"The mic is bad, so quiet that I thought I somehow had it muted.  I gave up on trying to use the mic (got a stand alone condenser studio mic for my desk) , but the headset has great charge life, good sound, and since it works fine while plugged in to charge, it has become my go-to headset anyhow.  Could use a bit more low range in the sound, but that's probably just my personal preference.",0
4.0,Great headphones for quiet work,"August 29, 2017",Yes,"These make the noisy environment that I'm in quite comfortable with either some music or white noise. It allows me to listen to my training sessions comfortably without interruption. I would give it 5 stars, but the microphone is too quiet for people to hear me sometimes because its placement is awkward on my large noggin. It does not pick up my voice very well, but I don't really use it for that anyways.",1
2.0,Sound quality no bueno,"December 6, 2018",Yes,These were purchased for my pre teen son. He said they sounded weird and did not Ike them. I had my husband try them hoping he would want to keep them. The ear pad area was too small and not comfortable. He also commented that the sound was off. He described it like a “tingy” sound as if the song was being song through something else. Not sure what that means?! Either way these are going back.,0
3.0,"Overall - good purchase. Worth the $45, not more.","January 4, 2018",Yes,"Overall...good purchase..Decent quality, I'd give it almost 4 stars. Fit is fine, the swivel of the cans helps to make for a good seal. Physical build quality is fine. Definitely good for the price, good enough sound for $45 but wouldn't want to pay more. They don't sound cheap but if you're a true audiophile you won't be happy with the lack of fullness of sound. I bought these as a test pair for work and treadmill treatment, didn't want to thrash on an expensive pair. Happy with them so far. Paired up to my phone without a problem. One thing I wish they had included in the mold would be one or two bumps on the controls so it's much easier to adjust vol and take calls, the whole surface is smooth over multiple controls so you have to feel around for the small groove at the edge of the controls to know where you are.",0
4.0,"Great product, Great sound","June 16, 2018",Yes,"These are great headphones, I'd give them 5 stars if my 4k TV would play the sound along with the headphones when sync'd. When connected to Samsung TV I only get sound through headphones and TV sound is not there. I went to settings apparently can only listen through tv or headphones, not both at same time. Great for music or connected to a phone,",0
4.0,Realistic expectations,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"If you stick to realistic expectations of a 35 dollar wireless over the ear headphone you won't be disappointed.  Sound is average and really what you'd expect. They do not sound amazing...These are tuned bass heavy. To much bass heavy in my opinion. It kinda sounds like you're in a tunnel. It's muddy and booming, not crisp and tight like a more expensive headphone would give you...The mids and highs lack clarity and sound a bit harsh and artificial. I found myself trying to tweak the equalizer presets on my phone but ended up just listening to it flat...They look good, the ear cups get a bit hot but they are soft and comfortable. No complaints so far on comfort and style..I'll use these for casual listening when I don't feel like plugging in my wired headphones and will knowingly sacrifice sound quality for wireless convenience...4 stars since they look and sound fine for 35 bucks!",0
4.0,Fits tightly but works well,"September 16, 2018",Yes,"I must have a head taller than most, because when I wear these they pull on the bottom of my ears. It also pushes tightly on the side of your head which may just be for noise cancelling, but it makes it hard to wear these for a long time. The sound, design, and battery are all fantastic though. Sometimes I do get the choppy connection before I'm alerted of a low battery, but recharging helps right away.",0
5.0,Great set of headphones for my workout,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"These sit tight on my head even with me running on a treadmill, no fuss! I can't stand in-ear buds, never have been able to wear them long enough or get them to stay on. This headset is great for working out or just around the house. I have connected to multiple devices (phone, ipad) and been able to switch between the two OK...One thing to note is that Although the headset has a mic, it does not work well so I don't recommend this for phone calls.",0
3.0,Broken.. replace for free.,"October 22, 2018",Yes,Lasted about 12 uses of approx 4 hour sessions. Worked ok and sounded ok. Now can hear out of one side only and its distorted bad.  Trash.Update. Thank you for sending me a free set of earphones since the ones i purchased broke. What a great surprise!  That is fantastic customer service.  thanks again,0
4.0,Great sound quality!,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"Great sound! I use these at the gym and they block out the music I don't want to listen to so I can listen to my own...The only downside...turning them off is more than a little confusing, even after reading the owners manual several times. I've finally resorted to just plugging them into the charger which does turn them off...Other than that, good headphones for the price.",0
5.0,Great for the price,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"Not the loudest but very clear and keeps out noise, so active noise cancellation isn't needed. Easy set up and comfortable. Single drawback is someone next to you can clearly hear what you are listening to. Could be disturbing on a plane or lying in bed next to your significant other late at night. But for the price what do you expect. Not in my gene pool to spend $200 for beats.",0
4.0,Couldn't hear a hand grenade beside me.,"January 23, 2018",Yes,"This may be a strange review but hear me out.  I've owned these for 3 days.  The sound quality is average.  Good bass, lower treble than I would like.  I listen to heavy metal while working out so the sound quality is sufficient for the price.  Less sound clarity than the corded ear buds that came with my IPhone but better than my previous wireless ear buds.  What I absolutely love is the outside noise blocking.  These headphones fit so perfectly snug without being tight.  I was lifting weights today and the cable broke.  I didn't even hear it, but obviously I felt it.  I looked around and the whole gym came running over.  They said that it sounded like a hand grenade went off.  I barely heard anything.  So if sound isolation is your thing, these are great.  The sound quality could be better but they are as comfortable as my daughter's $200 Beats.",0
3.0,Great as headphones,"May 26, 2017",Yes,"Great as headphones, reasonable price for what you get.  But I needed them to be usable as a headset to make and receive VOIP calls, and unfortunately the mic is just not good enough for that.  When wearing these, you can hear the caller clearly, but the caller cannot hear you very well through the headset mic.",1
3.0,"Affordable, but poor sound quality. Try H2 model!","April 17, 2018",Yes,"UPDATE: After leaving my first review, the company contacted me to apologize for my negative experience. They sent me a new pair of a different model, Mpow H2 shortly after. This new pair is AMAZING! The sound quality is perfect, and my partner can't hear what I'm listening to when he sits next to me anymore. They are comfortable and less bulky. The battery charge lasts forever, I use them every day!..Old Review: My first pair of wireless headphones, purchased for relaxing and doing dishes. Even on a lower volume, people around me can still hear what I am listening to. The sound quality is poor, no depth to acoustic music and rock comes in flat and muffled. They slide off my head if I am laying down or leaning back on the couch. Overall being wire free is great but if you want quality sound, *try the Mpow H2 model.",0
2.0,Finicky,"June 5, 2017",Yes,"Poor sound quality and does not work well with my pc.  Whenever I use these, I have to either restart the program I'm using and/or disconnect and reconnect the headset to fix the sound issue.  If I do that and I'm in skype, it hangs up the call.  Am not impressed.  Will just purchase a high quality gaming headset next time.",1
5.0,overall everything is thumbs up!,"October 13, 2017",Yes,"works great. sounds are clear. noise cancels well. aux to aux is fairly seemless.  comes with a small bag carrying case which is a nice bonus; i cant remember if it stated it included one in the description or not, but i was not expecting it so having it in there was a plus...minor grievance: i dont like that you cant have charging cord plugged in while using bluetooth, but aux cord still works when charging so if youre plugged in, youre plugged in, haha.  also still having read..overall everything is thumbs up!",0
3.0,Was disappointed by lack of basic feature,"March 10, 2018",Yes,"Overall mediocre experience due to a singular issue. Sounds are good (not an audiophile), and can get LOUD if you want them to. The idea of having the choice to go wired or unwired at my convenience was damaged by the inability to use headset controls when wired, so now if i want to go wired i have to unveil my phone every freaking time i want to do anything when listening to music. Even a pair of 20 dollar headphones offers that functionality and these were 40. Due to this I may have to consider getting a refund or something.Not sure if this is a bug or something.",1
3.0,"Comfortable, good customer service","June 12, 2018",Yes,"These were comfortable and had pretty good sound, but started having trouble with the buttons within the first week of having them. Maybe I just got a faulty pair...UPDATE: The sellers contacted me and sent me a new pair. So far, they have been working fine. I will update again if I have any trouble with the new ones.",0
5.0,"Quality product, should last long time.","August 29, 2017",Yes,"So, to start off, they aren't joking about the battery life, it is actually more than 13 hours of continuous play time, I have gotten 16 hours of play in one use, but if you use them about 2 hours a day, you can get almost 2 weeks of use out of one charge.  Next, the headphones are really comfortable, I personally have very pressure sensitive ears, and I have not had any issues with using this set of headphones for extended amounts of time.  Third, is the construction, I was a bit hesitant to have a pair of headphones that folded up because I expected them to be made completely of plastic, and wear out quickly.  That is definitely not the case with these, the headphones have reinforced metal where the headphones hinge and lock into place, so that negated my worries immediately.  The sound has pretty descent quality for the cost as well.  The distance for the Bluetooth is pretty good too, it is at least 100 ft radius when unimpeded by walls.  I have been very pleased with the quality of the product since purchase a couple of months ago.",0
3.0,"They work. That said, ...","August 11, 2018",Yes,"Bought this bcz of the price and good reviews. I have some positive and negative things to say:..Pros: They work. Good sound and they hold a charge..Cons: They’re heavy (259 grams), they feel too tight around my head (I feel the headphones squeezing against my ears and after a few minutes they become uncomfortable and too warm), I sometimes like to wear them at night, and here, too, I have issues: 1) the right side blinks very brightly every few seconds- this flashing is a nuisance, and 2) because the ear muffs fold inward (vs rotating out to the side), I can’t wear them if I want to lie on my side..Conclusion: While they’re okay, I got what I paid for. Not a great value at $50, hence the 3 stars.",0
4.0,"Good quality, great price","March 21, 2018",Yes,"Great sound.  Not loud enough for my likings, but that is govt. regulation.  Simple to operate, but cannot for the life of me get them to turn off when done using them.  Listen to  music while working around the house and get clear sound unless I'm out in the edge of the back yard or the front sidewalk.  Still have only charged once this month.  Bought a second pair",0
4.0,Works great but don't wander too far...,"August 11, 2018",Yes,"I got this for listening to audiobooks while on my elliptical and it's awesome for that.  No more bouncing cord. I've also used it while cleaning and it's great but I can't move too far away from the phone. Even the next room causes skipping.  It is great for what I use it for, though and the price was right.",0
4.0,They're also pretty comfortable on the head,"June 2, 2017",Yes,"These work very well. Sometimes, if you're slightly far away from your phone/device, they cut out a little bit, but they still continue to work. They're also pretty comfortable on the head, and the buttons are easy to tell which is which just by feel (as long as you know which ones are which first), and easy to push.",1
5.0,Five Stars,"July 5, 2017",Yes,Works great on TV with my Bluetooth Transmitter and perfect for my iPhone as well,3
3.0,Stopped working after a week...,"October 14, 2017",Yes,It stopped paring with my daughter's iPhone after a week. Now it only works when plugged in using a wire... which is pointless for bluetooth headphones...UPDATE: The manufacturer contacted me b/c my product was within their warrantee period and are sending me a new pair. Adding 2 stars for excellent customer service. I will further update this review after we have used the new pair of headphones.,1
3.0,"Good value, poor fit","April 26, 2018",Yes,"Pretty good sound quality for the price, but I am not too pleased with the fit. Since I wear glasses, I am always concerned with how over the ear headphones will feel. The padding on each ear is really nice and not bothersome at all, but they fit too tight no matter how I adjusted them...I wore these on a plane ride back and got the worst case of airplane ear I've ever had in my life, without much turbulence on the flight. I can't say for certain that it was due to these headphones, but I will need to be cautious going forward and may just return the pair.",0
5.0,Best affordable over the ear headphones!,"November 30, 2017",Yes,"Great value for the price! I bought these for office use to block out background noise, blocks out most sound if you have the volume on high but I am able to hear someone if they come up behind me, which is nice...It has wonderful sound quality, fits comfortably and what I love most is that it's both wireless and works with a wire if you forget to charge it. I've only used earbuds in the past, these are my first over the ear headphone and I love them! Hope they last. I was debating between buying the more expensive bose, beats but I'm glad i decided to go with the more affordable option, well worth the price.",0
5.0,Batteries WON'T DIE!!!,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"First, I'm a cautious shopper. I was looking for good quality and specifically, long battery life. After researching several models, I decided to try these headphones (delivered Monday 2-19-18). I charged them before use and, as of Friday 2-22-18, they HAVEN'T DIED YET!!! I have been using them all day, everyday. They are comfortable, sleek, and durable. The call quality is AWESOME!! Every person I call/talk to says that my voice is clear with no background noise - a problem with previous devices. Bottom line, BUY THEM!!!!",1
3.0,"Great for the user, horrible for the incoming caller.","June 21, 2018",Yes,"My husband wears these at work. He works in a warehouse so it does well cancelling out background noise for him. However, when I call him I can barely hear HIM, but can hear someone talking quietly across the room. It is SUPER FRUSTRATING! I want him to get rid of these things but he loves how they sound and how they are wireless and how they use a USB to charge.",0
4.0,Besides all that I love it! Works great,"June 9, 2018",Yes,"A little bulkier than I expected, but overall very fitting to the shape of my head. It's allows you to adjust accordingly. I believe it came with an aux cord attachment as well as a charger, however you need to have a USB wall adapter (Not included w. purchase). Besides all that I love it! Works great!",1
5.0,Great product to buy and definitely recommend.,"January 16, 2018",Yes,Great item to buy. This item is very nice and comparable to other expensive headsets out there. For the price it truly brings a good audio and the noise canceling is awesome. Definitely recommending this product to anyone who is looking for a good buy. Glad I came across this item while researching to replace another item I purchased that didn’t live up to it’s good reviews..Thanks and more power to Mpow. Great product for a great price.,0
4.0,"Great headset, wonderful seller.","June 7, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this headset in April. 1 Day after the return/product support window the call button that also controls power fell off the device...Two days after posting this review the seller contacted me to notify they were shipping me a new headset and apologized about the issue. Once I received the headset I immediately noticed the button to be more durable and attached to the headset correctly. I most likely received a faulty first product, but it happens. However this is one of the best headsets for the price. I plan on purchasing more in the future...Excellent sound quality, comfortable, AMAZING battery life. This headset really is great for the price and is sold from an amazing seller.",0
5.0,"Good fit, good sound, good appearance.","March 25, 2018",Yes,"I am enjoying the Mpow headphones.  First of all, they fit comfortably.  That is important to me because I wear them as I work.  The sound is good, I am not a sophisticated listener but I know what my music should sound like.  Finally, they seem to be well made and they are attractive in appearance (as headphones go.)  In my mind they are a good purchase.",0
5.0,Nice bluetooth heaphones,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"These bluetooth headsets were easy to pair to my laptop, smartphone , and even my TV. I really would not know if these have excellent quality as far as ""highs, lows,"" or whatever else those experienced music/sound experts look for, but for me the sound is excellent for what I need it for.",0
5.0,These headphones are awesome!,"March 8, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are awesome. They're comfortable, have an amazing sound, and hold a decent charge when using bluetooth. It's also very easy to pair them with your devices and to switch back and forth from different devices. I definitely would recommend these headphones.",2
4.0,"Get the different version of these headphones, with the EQ button.  HUGE difference in sound quality.","July 29, 2018",Yes,"When I first got these headphones, they sounded very muffled and bass-heavy.  I returned them and got a different version from MPOW, which had and EQ button on the side.  Get the version with the EQ button.  The sound quality is WAY better once you change the EQ, and disable the heavy bass EQ.  It actually sounds clear now.",0
5.0,Best Bang-for-the-Buck Headphones Ever!,"October 9, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great! Battery has lasted longer than the range the company gave by 2 hours, easy to connect via bluetooth, super comfortable fit over ears and adjustable to wear over a baseball hat and/or glasses. Sound quality and bass aren't Bose quality, but definitely good. I think these are better than many over ear headphones in the 100 dollar range.",1
5.0,Great for me!,"April 23, 2018",Yes,"So far so good. I really like them, they dont completely cancel out others being able to hear what you're listening to but I dont care because i bought them to wear while working out and on a plane and neither are quite places so I'll be good...if you're goal is to be able to listen to heavy metal in a library, you're out of luck with these.",0
5.0,BEST PURCHASE EVER!!,"February 7, 2018",Yes,From the second I wake up from when I go to bed I’m wearing these headphones!! They are so comfortable and the sound is amazing. I’m hearing more in songs. The charge lasts me days. And of course whenever I’m cleaning or other house work dishes having  no cord makes it so much convient for me. Pairing it to other devices is so easy seriously these headphones are life changing,0
4.0,Comfortable and great sound,"February 24, 2018",Yes,Comfortable and great sound.  Also the range is very good.  I can even walk outside and around the side of the house and it still receives a signal.  The only thing I don't like is the on/off/pairing sequence.  To turn it off you have to hold the button down through the entire sequences so every time I turn it off it tells me it is paring - disconnected - and finally off.,0
3.0,Underwhelmed,"June 30, 2017",Yes,The quality is subpar as far as sound goes.  They look amazing but the highs are not crisp and the mids are muffled.  Honestly they gave me a headache.  Tried returning them but was being charged $6.95 to do so.  So I'll just store them in a drawer.  Sound is VERY subjective however but they really aren't good.,1
3.0,Decent headphones for price but they don't have bass,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"These are comfortable, the ear area fits outside my ear so the foam doesn't compress on it, so it's excellent for glasses wearers and people with a lot of piercings in their ears like me. The sound quality is decent for the price in terms of hearing the music easily...The only problem I have with these is that the bass on them is either very subtle or nonexistent. That's very disappointing since music needs to have bass in order to really sound right. My beats by Dre headphones have better bass than these headphones and even the beats don't have excellent bass...I just need them to keep at the office so I don't have to bring my headphones to work every day, so they do the job I guess. We'll see how long I can last listening to music with no bass...",0
4.0,Nice set just need raised on off switch,"August 11, 2018",Yes,I love these headsets they have great sound. Only thing I wish that the p l us and minus for th e sound buttons had a raised bump that could be felt. I have to remove the head set to set the volume..I'm going to glue a 3 mm craft flat back stone on to the headset so I can feel them without removing them.,0
5.0,Stop reading and buy these,"April 30, 2018",Yes,Very comfortable for long term wear. The mic works well as well. I have used it in a pinch for a couple conference calls and they work well especially with the mic being up by the ear and not closer to the mouth. The sound quality is fantastic. I can't use ear buds any longer due to hearing loss and these are the best I have found yet.,0
5.0,"There is a reason these headphones have over 10,000 reviews","January 26, 2018",Yes,"There is a reason these headphones have over 10,000 reviews and still 4.5 stars. I love these headphones. They are super comfy and the battery is long lasting. Sound quality is great with the passive sound cancelling. You can link it to two different devices so you don't have to disconnect from one and reconnect from another. And I already bought a second pair for my boyfriend!",0
5.0,"Cute, hurts after awhile","November 3, 2018",Yes,"I thought it was perfect until I wore it for a few hours . Ended up buying another one (a black Jiuhufh) for the same price that was abit lighter weight, and comfortable for longer, but it is not as cute as my pink Mpow 059. Ended up keeping both and switch them out when one is hurting my ears.",0
3.0,Must Have. Great Price!!,"December 11, 2017",Yes,"Updated Review: Its been 1 year since I purchased and now the bluetooth and battery length have dwindled to where I get about 50% or less of the listening capacity I once did when new. A bit disappointed. Wonder if I'm the only one...Previous Review within a month of buying.I’ve had these headphones for maybe a month. And so far, love em. Walk around my office with music playing and I take conference calls everyday with these. Great sound quality. Feels good on my ears, best thing, the price was not $300 like Bose or Beats.",0
4.0,The sound quality is very good with no static,"July 30, 2018",Yes,"Since this was my first bluetooth headphone I really have nothing to compare it to.  The sound quality is very good with no static.  I use it to listen to music at the gym plus drown out the loud music they play.  It's a little bulkier than other headphones I see at the gym, but it really doesn't bother me since the price is good.  As for the color I selected, the pink is a pale pink.",0
4.0,Worth the money,"June 17, 2018",Yes,"Good battery life. Quick recharge. Plastic is a little on the flimsy side. But no cheaply made. Sound quality is very good for price range. Don't expect Boss or Beats sound and bass. Great for kids. My 3 y/o loves it. The pink is ""pretty pink"" as my daughter stated. Soft grey holding pouch is a nice little extra.",0
5.0,Awesome headphones for the price,"November 2, 2017",Yes,"I ordered these based on the positive reviews and YouTube reviews.  These are not as good as my much more expensive Sony wired headphones, but they’re very good nevertheless.  I’ve been using them for a week now. They lack a bit of bass that you may want for some music but they are overall pretty well balanced.  They’re pretty comfortable but not quite OVER THE EAR but I tuck into them well. Looks awesome, easy controls and pairing, a good sound.  Great bargain at $35.",1
5.0,Good headphones at a good price,"October 1, 2017",Yes,"Due to a hearing problem, I decided to buy Bluetooth headphones rather than blow everyone out of the house with the volume on the TV all the way up. I was looking at a $100 set when I stumbled upon this set on Amazon. The reviews were good, the price was right so I ordered them. Great move!!! These headphones are excellent for my needs. Very good stereo sound separation, very good noise reduction and the bass isn't low enough to be a problem. That I can attach to two devices is a nice plus. Also,  they're very light and comfortable. I highly recommended them !!",0
3.0,I like it but I don't like it that much,"July 30, 2018",Yes,"I like it but I don't like it that much.  They are huge headphones and the pressure to my hears was more than I could take for a run, walk or just sitting listening to music.  They are functional, their battery last for long whiles, I charged a few times.  I use it on extreme occasions but I am thinking of giving it to a kid.  Thanks anyway.",0
4.0,Solid set of earphones for the price,"August 18, 2018",Yes,"Overall a very solid set of Bluetooth headphones for the price. Long battery life, comfortable earcups,  and great Bluetooth range are huge pluses. The only drawback I've found are they seem to favor the high end of the sound spectrum, making some things sound very slightly tinny. These would be perfect if they had a bit more bass, but still very nice, especially considering the price point.",0
4.0,"Nice sound, doesn't really cancel noise for me","January 25, 2018",Yes,"Nice sound, doesn't really cancel noise for me, but my 6 year old acts like she cant hear anything with these on. My only issue is that the aux cord that came with the headphones stopped working after like 2 weeks, maybe a month, but it was very quick. Luckily, i had another aux cord laying around the house that I am able to use. My 6 year old hasn't figure out how to connect to Bluetooth, so it is easier for me to use the aux cord.",0
3.0,"Good, not great.","December 4, 2017",Yes,"Its bluetooth so the sound quality will only ever be so good. Typical hollowed out/far off in the distance type of sound. The left ear cup has a weird squeek when moving the headset in anyway, but otherwise its not too bad although I would not jog or workout with such an issue...The headphones are light, but the headband has little give when resting on top of your head. The fit is a bit on the tight side as the C shape really wants to stay in the C shape. At least they wont fall off...The headphones are still cheap enough to overlook these things for the most part, but $10 more and they may not be. I paid $37.",0
1.0,Returned after first day.,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"Able to connect to my computer (using adapter) and my phone easily, however, sound and speech quality was shotty. Need reliable bluetooth headphones for work. When connected to my computer, it worked 25 minutes into a meeting, then all sound and speaking capabilities just stopped.",1
5.0,Satisfied Customer,"June 23, 2017",Yes,"I was looking for bluetooth headphones over the ear that I could also make and receive phone calls and found this inexpensive gem. I had an ear impacted with ear wax and needed to stop using my in-ear bluetooth headphones. I've had these headphones for a week and they are working perfectly. I wear them when working out--treadmill and strength training. They're not noise-canceling, but they do reduce noise. I haven't yet used the audio cable that came with the headphones, but that's a nice plus as well as the carrying case. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.",0
3.0,Hurts our ears/heads,"August 22, 2017",Yes,"Good at cancelling noise, and work as promised, but the small size causes ear pain after a short time.  All three members of our family have tried using them (two adults and one child) and we all experienced pain from using them.  If they happen to fit you well, then my guess is you will love them..**EDIT: When the vendor saw my review they did everything they could to be sure they had satisfied customer.  While this particular product did not fit my family, Patozon stands behind their product and strive to achieve exceptional customer service.**",1
3.0,Has irritating flashing lights.,"April 3, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are ok, and definitely worth what you pay for them.  I have trouble pairing two devices at a time with them but that might be common with other head phones.  They are large and I wouldnt wear them in public.  The biggest problem I have with them is the constant flashing lights coming from them.  Makes it very difficult to use them while someone else is trying to sleep, and I would kill someone if they had these on next to me on a plane.  Good for just wearing around the house.",0
5.0,Works perfect and the setup was super easy,"August 6, 2017",Yes,"Bought this and <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/TaoTronics-Bluetooth-4-1-Transmitter-Receiver-2-in-1-Wireless-3-5mm-Adapter-aptX-Low-Latency-2-Devices-Simultaneously-For-TV-Home-Sound-System/dp/B01EHSX28M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TaoTronics Bluetooth 4.1 Transmitter / Receiver, 2-in-1 Wireless 3.5mm Adapter (aptX Low Latency, 2 Devices Simultaneously, For TV / Home Sound System)</a> to listen to the tv when my husband wants some quiet. Works perfect and the setup was super easy.",1
4.0,Not ideal for bigger heads,"June 20, 2018",Yes,So these headphones were great in regards to quality and comfort.  The sound quality itself was comparable to higher end ANC headphones and I really enjoyed them. Only issue was the tightness around my big head.,1
5.0,Update wow!,"August 28, 2017",Yes,"I really can’t believe how much I enjoy these headphones. I’ve stated using them more often than my beats studio or beatsX. I grab them at home to connect to my Mac while working and they’re great. I can’t believe I use them more that $600 dollars worth of beats. Only problem is they fit a little, I mean little, loose. This is easily fixed by wearing my ball cap..Nice headphones for the price. Clean vocals and solid mids. Not as much bass as my beats studio wireless but I would definitely recommend these headphones. Easy connection to my iPhone 7.",0
5.0,Very Good!,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"Very comfy to wear, easy Bluetooth pairing to my iphone 5SE music feature. The original pair I had was defective, and I gave it a less than stellar review, but the company gladly replaced it, and these headphones work very well. Editing my rating, to a 5 star (previously was a 3 star). Recommend these, great item and really good value.",0
3.0,the overall sound is not bad at all,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"The treble is low while the bass is not very powerful. Still, the overall sound is not bad at all. It's quite good actually. The reason I am giving it three stars are the following:..1. headphones are a little on the heavy side,.2. the arch is slightly hard and uncomfortable on the top of the head, and.3. both the usb charging and auxiliary cables are too short for my liking. The USB charging is less than 2 feet and the auxiliary cable is about 4 feet long...Others have said that it is uncomfortable on the ears. I have not used it for long periods of time, but I can see how the factors 1 and 2 can make it an uncomfortable experience to wear it for an hour or longer.",0
4.0,These a very comfortable headphones with nice sound quality,"July 1, 2018",Yes,"These a very comfortable headphones with nice sound quality. I wish they were a little more noise cancelling, but they are pretty fantastic. The buttons on the side are difficult to use without having to take off the headphones and look at the controls though. They work really well both in bluetooth mode and plugged in.",0
2.0,I'd spend an extra $20 on something better.,"June 18, 2018",Yes,"I used these at work. The speakers died out after 3 weeks. Very suddenly. They were comfortable, long range on the Bluetooth, and folded up nicely but durability was garbage. There is a voice that tells you when the volume is at max and you have to listen to a full 3 second sentence explaining this to you... Why isn't just a beep. Sounds like a nitpick but when you are hitting the volume on it and you just guess at 5 hits but really one gets you to max, you have to listen to 4 full sentences telling you that you are at max volume. That's Hot nonsense. Style is nice so its gets 2 stars.",0
5.0,Great noise cancelling headphones!,"September 16, 2018",Yes,"I like that it muffles background noise well, which makes it easier to enjoy whatever I am listening too when the tv is on in the background.",1
5.0,Don’t get mad - Get headphones !,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my husband as I was tired of answering his ‘what did they say?’ questions all day long as he watched his favorite cable news ad nauseum. I don’t know what to do with all my spare time now. Once I figured out that the necessary Bluetooth device connected to the Direct TV receiver, not the TV (duh!) they paired flawlessly and I have my life back.",0
4.0,but they're great if you're doing relatively stationary exercises (bench / squat ...,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"so far this has been the only BT headset whose battery hasn't crapped out on me mid-workout -- AND they have a corded option for backup..Only advice I'd have is that they're not super-ideal for running, or if you're a heavy sweater -- they tend to overheat my head when I'm jogging... but they're great if you're doing relatively stationary exercises (bench / squat cage / olympic lifts)",0
3.0,The good: Sound when listening to music is great,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"The good:.Sound when listening to music is great. Charge lasts forever. Deafens other noises pretty well. Buttons on the side to control volume, song, and power. Looks just like it’s shown...The bad:.I wear these for work so around hour 6 they start to hurt the top of my head. The headset option for phone calls is practically useless since everyone sounds completely muffled and incoherent. There is a really bright blue light that flashes about every 3 seconds when it’s on, which makes it annoying to wear them in the dark while watching something. An obnoxiously loud “MAXIMUM VOLUME” alert when your headphone volume is up all the way that hurts my ear...Takeaway: I would’ve paid the same amount for less features that try to be progressive and just end up being annoying.",0
4.0,Some of the best I have to say,"September 10, 2017",Yes,"Used these for a few workouts. Some of the best I have to say. These are very light weight. When I had them on and the music turned up , I felt like I was in my own world. The only negative to these is the distance between device is headphones is not very far before they begin to cut out. I'm going to give them a 4/5  and not 5/5 for because of the distance factor and I'm not sure how long these will hold up in the long run",0
5.0,Versatile and Comfortable,"July 16, 2017",Yes,"Comfortable and perfectly portable as I need it to be. Good sound quality. I like that it works either as a standard wired headset where it doesn't have to be turned on, or a portable bluetooth headset. Connectivity was spotty with the bluetooth integrated on my motherboard but I'm pretty sure it was the bluetooth and not the headset. Got a bluetooth dongle and it worked without issue...Very happy with this purchase.",0
5.0,Headphone,"August 2, 2017",Yes,Yes I really love them they r nice and loud. I love them even more because I can drain out my in-laws when they be talking to me they are good headphones to wear especially when your in-laws are at your house and they start talking to you just throw them on and you won't be able to hear them,1
5.0,Better than a sunshine enema,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"I received the headphones at the expected date and very easily connected them, via Bluetooth, with no issue. I immediately turned them all the way up and found that the sound is good but nothing earth shattering. ( If you want Beats or Bose sound, don’t be cheap like me and just shell out for them) I was able to call my wife while out on my property and I heard her crystal clear. These headphones are comfortable and day one I’m pleased with my purchase. For the price, you are getting a nice pair of headphones.",1
5.0,He likes it.,"July 26, 2017",Yes,"These headphones look great, seem to be comfortable, it was very easy to connect with my phone, my laptop and my TV. Good range, I think I can push it to 40' &amp; more and still have connection..I wasn't overly impressed with the sound, for music they are just OK...Perfect for listening to my real estate stuff and my self help MP3 recordings..I havnt used the phone answering feature yet, but I like that option,",0
3.0,It was a really good headphone. I unfortunately had to return it,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"It was a really good headphone. I unfortunately had to return it, cause I didn’t realize that I needed an extra device for it to work with my tv, and I didn’t wanna spend more money on it so that’s why I returned it. I gave it only 3 stars cause the title was misleading. It says that it works with phones and tvs, and doesn’t mention that you need an adapter for it to work with your tv.",0
4.0,While the Mpow's are not quite as good as those for the money they are very good,"January 14, 2018",Yes,I also own a set of $300 Sennheiser wireless headphones which are in use at my principal residence. While the Mpow's are not quite as good as those for the money they are very good. The on/off is a bit difficult  but other than that they perform well and are reasonably comfortable. I use them primarily for TV watching to avoid disturbing the spouse and they handle the task well. No comment on battery life as I have no had them long enough.,0
5.0,Be ready for audio feedback fr command and connection events,"January 24, 2018",Yes,It was hard to get used to audio feedback for your command. I thought that I paired with someones phone of a neighbor first :) But finally i was able to pair them with my PC. There was no other obstacles afterwards..I love how it feels on my head and ears..Note: It is not very clear how much of charge left on headphones and how many hours left to charge.,0
4.0,"Comfortable headphones, not noise blocking","August 29, 2017",Yes,"Comfortable headphones, not noise blocking. The features I cared about were:..-over the ear/comfort.-Bluetooth connectivity.-Built in microphone.-Decent sound..So far, I haven't had issues when connecting to bluetooth, people can hear me clearly and the headphones are ok with comfort. The mic is very sensitive and picks up the fan near me, but I'm sure I can adjust that in the future. Overall, I'm sure there are better headphones out there geared toward audiophiles, but these are a decent set of headphones for my needs. I use these to chat with my team when playing a video game.",0
5.0,These ARE AS ADVERTISED.,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are truly wonderful headphones. The over the ear type just sounds so dynamic! Upon at first scoffing at the price vs. Quality thing, my wife ordered herself a pair as well. I'm sure more expensive headphones have something better going for them, but when I'm listening to days of future past ( I'm a 65 year old...) I'm very happy with them.",0
4.0,Great sound and comfortable,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Surprising quality for the price..Great sound, comfortable, interacts great with my devices..Occasionally when I pause a song using the headphones, then hit play again, it will play the music, but also play another album at the same time. It only has happened with amazon music, so I'm not sure if it's the device, app or the headphones that cause the issue.",0
4.0,Not bad..,"November 5, 2017",Yes,"Not bad.... good for the price, but overall audio quality is kinda flat. Wish it was better, but honestly I just like the idea of having wireless headphones at a decent price...Build quality is mediocre - I can tell I need to take extra care because the hard plastic (which feels thin) could possibly break at any moment...Still - I'll state again, for the price it's hard to beat.",0
5.0,Great Headphones!!,"August 31, 2018",Yes,"I LOVE these headphones! I bought them to replace my old iPod earbuds (circa 2009) that finally gave up the ghost. I have Bose noise cancelling headphones but really didn't want to being them into the office. I work with some chatty guys and these do a pretty good job of keeping the noise out...Pairing was really easy and I love that i can control playback and volume on these. Haven't used them for a phone call, but overall great quality! Highly recommend as a backup or second pair!",0
4.0,Very good but could use some slight improvements for larger/longer heads. Otherwise great sound clarity &amp; very comfortable.,"February 24, 2017",Yes,"Very good sound quality, paring ease, skip function, volume etc... however the quality of phone calls isn't great (microphone placement). Also it would be great to have longer extensions for folks with longer/larger heads. A tad bit short/uncomfortable due to length. HOWEVER... the material is wonderfully soft and comfortable. A little more length and this is 5 stars for me as I'm not using it for phone calls! Also the sound muffling is great due to material.",0
1.0,Very disappointed 😞,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"When I first received these I loved them, I used them maybe 6 times for around 2 hrs when I’m watching tv while my husband sleep- they no longer allowed me to turn them off I would have to wait until the charge die, then I couldn’t change volume, now they have a full charge but will not come on st all.",13
4.0,They are great headphones with really good sound and bass,"August 9, 2018",Yes,I wanted to wait to review it to see how well they work. They are great headphones with really good sound and bass. Don't have any issues with Bluetooth pairing on my phone. The only issue I have is I mainly use them for my laptop and watch my shows. After using them for a couple months the Aux cord is starting to wear out. If you turn a certain way it will cause the right side (the side not connected) to go out and come back. This is easily fixed by getting a standard Aux cord from anywhere. All in all I love them and they are very comfortable for long wear time even with glasses!,0
4.0,"Good ears, great price","October 26, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones for the price. There's a very soft whining/buzzing noise when the headphones are on which is the only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5. The whine is not noticeable with music playing, but is present without. Great battery life, good sound quality, better than expected noise cancelling, comfortable to wear for long periods, nice deep color and gloss finish. Pairing is simple and quick, and the 3.5mm jack option is a really nice feature. All together a quality headphone, especially for such a low price.",1
5.0,11 yo son loves thse,"February 17, 2018",Yes,These are used both in classroom for e-lesrning as well as at home for music videos on youtube and gaming or outside walking the dogs. There are no connectivity problems. They are very comfortable otherwise my son who is a bit sensory sensitive would have rejected them in a heartbeat. They are his favorite accessory. They are great value and look great.,0
5.0,Excellent product for the price,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"These fit well and the passive noise cancelling is OK, you can still hear loud noises. When playing music, you can sit in a noisy cafe and only hear the occasional high-pitched laughter of sorority girls or babies. Pretty comfortable, they do have a little weight to them that is noticeable if you don't wear over-ear style often. The sound is clear with both the included cable and with Bluetooth, however the ""Bluetooth connecting voice"" can be a bit jarring.",0
5.0,No super noise reductive but they don't advertise that and are ...,"December 8, 2017",Yes,"No super noise reductive but they don't advertise that and are actually very clear about it in the description. But the battery is long lasting and the sound is great. And they are really comfortable, some will pinch your hair, slip off your head or not fit well over your ears - and these don't do any of that so they get a 5 star from me and I'll be giving some as a gift as well.",0
5.0,Love these. Use them at the gym,"October 6, 2017",Yes,"Love these. Use them at the gym. They completely block the music the gym blasts. They are relatively light weight, easy to use, great sound, seems like good battery life. They stay in place even when I'm using the ab crunch machine. They slip off the top of my head, but not off my ears, when I'm laying flat on the hydro-massage table. No problem! 2 year warranty is nice. Would buy again. Recommend.",0
2.0,Overly hyped,"January 31, 2018",Yes,"I'm picky with headphones to the point that I've considered being a sound engineer. These are good enough for my mom, who isn't that picky on her audio. I panic if things don't sound decent though, especially when I'm gaming. If footsteps in game aren't clear then I freak out way more than I should. These are overly hyped and sound like they were from the discount section at Ross. They're only good for appearance and not that great for audio at all. Wouldn't buy again but not worth throwing away.",0
4.0,"Works well, minor complaint","February 21, 2018",Yes,"Works great. Pairs easily. Only thing I'm not wild about it, when it says ""Power On"" or ""Power Off"" the voice isn't very clear, such that these two phrases sound exactly the same. Not helpful to have it announce Power On/Off if these two can't be distinguished. But it's comfortable, has a good battery life, cups the ear to block out other sounds without having to turn the volume way up to hear.",0
5.0,"Comfortable, excellent battery life, great sound quality","January 22, 2018",Yes,Unless you've got a thing for paying FAR too much for headphones these are exactly what you should buy.  I was tired of ear buds and how uncomfortable they were.  You will not find a better pair of headphones that are so easy to use and comfortable for the price.  Battery life is excellent and I've yet to have mine run out before I get a chance to charge them.  Sound quality is great and they are very easy to pair with any Bluetooth device.  Might just buy another pair or two for gifts!!,0
1.0,RETURNED IMMEDIATELY,"November 19, 2018",Yes,You get what you pay for. I could've bee alright with the slightly heavy and gaudy. But I was not impressed with the sound quality.,1
5.0,Best over ear headphones ever!,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones!! I bought these after pouring over the reviews. I got tired of constantly having to put my right in ear headphone back in. These definitely have a surround sound quality. I love Metal and the in ears don't do justice like these. Simply put, splurge a little to get theater quality sound. I'm not going back to in ear headphones. These sealed the deal. The only thing didnt like was there wasn't much of color options.",0
3.0,"Alright, but ears get very warm/uncomfortable after an hour or so","September 20, 2017",Yes,"While the sound quality is pretty good, and they're generally comfortable to wear, the material that the ear pads are made of doesn't breath at all and it gets really hot to wear them for more than like an hour at a time. I've taken to only like half wearing them so as to avoid it as an issue",1
5.0,Like I said maybe its just the pair I got ...,"October 11, 2017",Yes,"**Update** So after posting this the seller contacted me and sent me a new pair. The customer service alone made me bump up my stars. I think the first pair I got was faulty cause the new pair works great. I would purchase from this seller again..For the sole purpose of being headphones, they do the job. however I must have received a faulty pair because I cant even put my phone in my back pocket or the sound will start skipping or lose sound completely. My phone or tablet has to be directly in front of me when using the Bluetooth feature in order for the sound to work. Like I said maybe its just the pair I got because I see that people can run with theirs and if I try something as simple as walking or stretching my arm out too far the sound cuts out. Probably wouldn't purchase these again.",0
5.0,$35 bucks never sounded so good,"May 14, 2018",Yes,"First off I want to say these headphones will piss you off. I owned a pair of boats studio 3 wireless that got stolen from me and didnt have the money to buy another pair so I bought these for 35 bucks to get me by until I could get a nice pair. I got these charged them up and tested them out. I heard 20 seconds of mediocre by TI, took them off and threw them across the room. These things immediately pissed me off so bad I may still take them outside and toss them in front of a quickly moving school bus because for 35 dollars I can do that. These headphones sound as good to say the least, as the $450 beats did. Amazing. High five to Mpow. Giving us good sounding headphones that we can afford to buy. Do yourself a favor and buy 2. Everyone I get presents for better be expecting a new set of headphones this year.",0
5.0,Such a Great Product For the Price!,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"Great headphones for the price! The only thing is that they don't feel very ""sturdy,"" so if you have little kids (like I do) you have to be careful to keep them out of the way..But, the sound quality is great!.These aren't noise canceling, but I didn't want that as I still need to hear crying little ones.",0
4.0,For the price it's not bad (However....),"August 10, 2018",Yes,"For the price these headphones are not bad however the sound is a little colored, meaning it's not as flat as some other headphones. For example the bass seems to be a little filtered and not as heavy. So if you're buying these headphones for good quality professional use, don't bother. However if you're buying these headphones to use (for maybe walking or working out) then these might be really useful to you. The battery life is really good on these headphones as well, and I'm also able to remotely listen at long distances as well. Like I said, the sound quality is a little filtered especially when it comes to the bass, it is hard to articulate but the best way to describe it is that the sound quality is not exactly flat but has a slight curve to it.",0
5.0,Good Price Good Quality,"April 26, 2018",Yes,Purchased these to replace some Beats Solo 3s that would've costed more than 3 times the amount of these for repair. I just received these and connected them to all my devices with music and I'm satisfied. They do NOT have noise canceling hardware but the size of the large headphones combined with the soft cushion could easily make you forget about the rest of the world when you're jamming out. I felt so immersed while testing them out while on a bike ride I had to leave them a little off my ears. Wish they came with a way for the automated system to inform you of the battery life ala a UE Boom speaker but if you'll get get an onscreen battery indicator if you use an iPhone. Also the iPhone wall plug is the best charging plug to use. So far so good!,0
5.0,"Amazing, can't do better for price.","April 6, 2018",Yes,"I absolutely love these. They don't have that annoying buzzy sound in the background like other Bluetooth earbuds/headphones I've had. I actually think the sound is better on Bluetooth than when using the wire. They fit comfortably...they don't squeeze my giant head and give me a headache like some others have. You can skip songs, turn up/down the volume, turn on/off, play/pause, with the buttons on the side. Battery life is long enough. Really, for the price, I don't think you can do much better.",0
5.0,Work great.,"November 16, 2017",Yes,These work great. They hold a charge a long time but I don't use them constantly so I just charge them every couple weeks. My only criticisms are that: 1) the ear cups are a little small for my ears but not a big deal. 2) The microphone makes me sound like I'm speaking from the other room. This isn't an issue either since I didn't purchase them with the intent of making phone calls with them..Overall they are great with great sound  and my son liked mine so much that he saved his money (he's 11) to get a pair as well.  My son's headphones sound great when speaking on the phone so maybe mine are just a fluke.,0
1.0,10 weeks and it stopped working,"July 29, 2017",Yes,Pretty sad.  It worked very well and then week 6 it stopped charging so couldn't use Bluetooth . Week 10 it doesn't work with the 3.5 mm cable either. I can't return to Amazon as the return window is closed. Disappointed.,24
5.0,Amazing,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"I absolutely love these headphones. They have great sound, are pretty comfortable, and the battery lasts..I was hesitant to get over ear headphones for awhile because my head is sensitive and I get headaches easily/often. I can wear these for hours and not worry about headaches, as long as they're not too tight on my head (duh), although I do need to take a break every now and then..They're amazing, I keep getting compliments, and they inspired my coworker to get a pair of his own.",0
5.0,"For the price they sound good, they get pretty loud","February 20, 2018",Yes,"These are worth every penny !.For the price they sound good , they get pretty loud . Wore them for a long time and they were comfortable, and I where glasses and have a big Mellon !  If your in denial and think they will proform like high end beats or Bose then don’t buy them ! But my wife has the mid level bose and it’s pretty close , where the bose stand out is the clarity but they were 4 times the price . All things they say these do they do , the only negative thing I could even think of is they are a little big on how much they stick out on the ears and if you blare the music people around you can hear it but still a very good buy",0
4.0,Difficult to turn off,"March 26, 2018",Yes,The sound is great and I really like how well it syncs - there's not a delay in hearing what someone is saying. I am having1 problem with it though. It's hard to turn it off - it stays on or if it does finally turn off it will turn itself back on within seconds ight with any movement. It's very frustrating and will eat the battery time hip,0
5.0,Great customer service,"May 8, 2018",Yes,After just 3 days of use headphones  won't charge or stay connected via Bluetooth. I sent back to Amazon. And was refunded my money. But this company went beyond great customer service by sending out a new pair to me. Without even talking with me just did it. The new pair is working great. A+ and 5 stats just for the customer service.,0
4.0,So far so good!,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"Jeff's wife,.Upon an unfortunately delayed arrival, I have.been jamming hard on my new headphone and love them. I bought these for my 6 day a week gym regime. I previously had a wired-attached to my phone-on an arm band deal so these will be a godsend. I like to blare my music and apparently you can hear it. As far as up keep and longevity if anything terrible happens I will repost but I will give this a tentative 4 stars...",0
5.0,Soft on the ears in more than one way,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable on the ears, lush sounds from these lovely headphones. The Bluetooth connection is simple to set up, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. I am not an earbud person. I have tried many different headphones, I like these best. Definitely recommend. Arrived well packed and in the window for delivery as promised.",0
2.0,... using these headphones for a while I really don't like anything except for the fit,"October 23, 2017",Yes,"After using these headphones for a while I really don't like anything except for the fit.  The sound is actually terrible, as the base and just above are over emphasized and the upper frequencies are all muffled.  I will probably give them to my kids.",1
5.0,Amazing customer service- you can be confident buying these.,"September 23, 2018",Yes,"these charged fully only once and can only be used as corded headphones- big bulky corded headphones...not sure why anyone would want these..Revised- wow, totally unexpectedly amazing customer service. They are sending me a replacement without me even asking. I am impressed. Thank you.",0
1.0,Gives me headaches,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"Pretty decent noise canceling capabilities. But after wearing it for just a couple hours a day, it would give me such a splitting headache. I’ve tried using it for several weeks and the headphones just haven’t loosen up enough. And I don’t even have a very large head, I wear a hat size small, the headphones just squeeze the sides of my head too much.",0
3.0,Wish they worked better through walls.,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"Doesn't work well through walls.I have the Dish network and receiver is in a cabinet in a custom closet. If more than 10' away, music/any noise bounces around and is annoying. They are comfortable. Use ONLY with in a clear shoot of ANY receiver that is blue-tooth ready. Music is no problem as well as you are within 10' of it. The 33' is not limited to these headphones.",0
5.0,... pair for each of my boys and they absolutely love them. My older son has some issues with ...,"November 18, 2017",Yes,Got a pair for each of my boys and they absolutely love them. My older son has some issues with noise sensitivity so I got these headphones to help drown out bothersome background noises. He wears them on the bus in the morning and can now listen to his music rather than be bothered by the various noises of others on the bus. He also wears them while doing his homework and they seem to help him focus on the task at hand.,1
5.0,These are very easy to pair and have great sound,"July 14, 2017",Yes,"These are very easy to pair and have great sound. They're a little bit heavy, but they're great for being able to walk around and listen to my music, TV, or online meeting or listen to music after my husband has already gone to bed. The range for the bluetooth is fantastic. I can walk around my entire second floor and not lose connectivity with any of my other devices. I have not tried pairing and using this with my phone yet.",0
3.0,Good for the price but not amazing,"April 8, 2018",Yes,"Ok for the price but makes ears very warm. Also it’s way too loud for others. When I see people wearing beats similar headphones I can’t hear what they are listening to. These are so loud and clear that other people can hear your lyrics fully when wearing them. Might be a design flaw but you def can’t wear these in and office or library. Still they are cheap for the cost and could be good to use at home, I don’t like wearing them outside because the feel cheap and hot and people complain about the loudness. Also the sound quality isn’t great. Apple ear buds sound better",0
3.0,Good but some noise,"September 6, 2017",Yes,"I like the feel of these headphones and they are easy to use. The sound isn't as good as I hoped as there was some noise (fuzzy) when I'm wearing them.  Also I think they might be large on me because as I walk I can feel/hear every step I take through the headphones moving on my head.  They paired up easily, were easy to charge, and have been consistently able to repair each time I turn them on.",0
5.0,Excellent headphones for the price.,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"I originally left a 3-star review but I think it's simply unfair of me to give an average rating to a product that was everything it was advertised to be. Plus, I've had more time to use the headphones and realize they're much better than I originally thought. Thanks for the awesome headphones and for the top-notch customer service, Mpow.",0
4.0,it works fine. at some scenario,"April 15, 2018",Yes,"it works fine. at some scenario, for example,before open youtube, light background nosie is heard. but noise disappear once viedo sound come out..also the headphone is too tight and I feel pain and unconformtable after half hour wearing. to solve this issue, I just wear it to some big item than my head such as tissue box every day. several days later, it loose and I feel better..so far it’s good specially for price/function.",0
5.0,I LOVE IT!,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"I use this to listen to music while working and answer the phone. It works on Windows 10 &amp; it's a plug &amp; play but you need one of those USB dongles. Only thing I don't like is that the sound is very loud on outer headphones so people next to you will hear what you are listening to. I would buy this again in the future for my laptop. For its price, I LOVE it!",0
5.0,"Well made, comfortable headphones that have an expensive appearance","July 30, 2018",Yes,"I already had a pair of Mpow headphones with microphone and I have been very happy with those.  I bought my new Mpow Bluetooth Headphones for listening to meditation scripts and they have been working out great.  Despite being inexpensive, they are well-made, very comfortable and have an expensive look to them.",0
5.0,Best bluetooth headphones I've found for the money,"July 15, 2018",Yes,"I've spend more money on other bluetooth headphones that didn't feel as good at this one does, it has a nice weight to it while not being heavy. The pads for the ears are also fantastic and fits wonderfully for me, I can wear this for hours (which I often do) without a problem. It also does a good job of canceling out surrounding noise. I'm not a big audiophile but I think the sound quality is overall good. They also have good customer service, my first headphones didn't charge properly but the company took them back and got me a new set without much issue and I've been digging these headphones ever since. Good range and quick connectivity. I don't write reviews often, but I like these headphones a lot, so I would recommend them.",0
4.0,"Great sound, good range, even better price","May 30, 2018",Yes,"Very pleasantly surprised and pleased with these headphones. The sound is great for the price. Battery life is very good, range is great. Comfy for the most part, but I wear glasses and I am conscious of the sides of my head if I wear them for an extended period of time. I would still purchase again and recommend to others.",0
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised!,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"I just transitioned from working from home to an office setting, and these headphones have been a bless.  Even if I'm not listening to music, they muffle a lot of ambient noise.  I can also jam my music at a high volume and haven't heard complaints.  I plug them in at night and keep them unplugged all day.  I haven't had an issue with battery power yet.  These are now as essential as my keyboard.  I'd be lost without them.",0
5.0,Good Quality,"July 18, 2018",Yes,I use it to listen to TheNoSleep podcast while doing chores or falling asleep. The wireless bluetooth feature makes it easy to move around the house or turn over in bed with no restrictions. The noise canceling feature ensures my stories are not drowned out by outside noise. This was a great buy for me.,0
5.0,Great Product! Great Price!,"July 20, 2017",Yes,"These are Nice! I've had the four hundred dollar part of beats before and I tell you what they come really close to them. If you want something that sounds really good and is good quality... I highly suggest this headphones. Sound Good, Built Good and the price is awesome!.Update - I bought a second pair for my wife for Christmas",1
5.0,My families only choice from now on!!!!,"December 13, 2017",Yes,I bought these head phones for my husband. He has never loved any as much as he loves these. We have spent lots of money on certain brands and he said they don't compare to these mpows. He works on machinery all day and loves how these head phones drown out all the noise. He said the clarity is amazing as well as the sound and they are so comfortable you forget you are wearing them. The best part is when I call him I can actually hear him clearly and nothing else from background noise. And the charge life is incredible. They were the best buy I've made to date. I would proudly recommend them and will be purchasing many more sets for the rest of the family including myself. Excellent product with a steal of a price.,0
5.0,Good product!,"October 9, 2018",Yes,"This is the first water flosser that I’ve brought and recommended by family. I had a little trouble to setting it up and a bit uncomfortable to use it during my first time. Oh well, the first time for everything seem to be troublesome here or there. However, the product turns out to be pretty simple and user friendly after a few time..Pros:.-Good result with two minutes of flossing on a daily basis..-Different pressures help with personal preference/needs..-Teeth is whiten and no more bleeding due to weak gems...I will recommend to my friends and family that have family history of weaker gem or related disease/problems.",0
5.0,really comfortable and great sound,"September 15, 2017",Yes,"Ordered this for my husband...really comfortable and great sound. Only problem was that we have Amazon Prime...ordered it on Thursday and didn't receive it till the following Wednesday. USPS shipped it to Columbia, Mo for some reason; then to Des Moine IA, LOL! Finally sent back to Kansas City and we received it mid-day Wednesday. I liked the headphones so well that I ordered another pair for myself. Also dead easy to pair to device...husband was listening to you tube within a couple of minutes!",0
1.0,Not good for telecommuters!,"February 20, 2018",Yes,"Purchased these to use for work, mainly for Skype and  conference calls.  Not sure if I have a defective set but when speaking on the phone the left ear is terrible cracking white noise etc and Skype calls are even worse.  Music sound is average.  Pros:  they look cool and are comfortable.  Sadly, I am returning and the search continues...",0
3.0,The Fidelity was great but they were heavy on my head,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"The Fidelity was great but they were heavy on my head, so I returned them. No problems with customer service or the return...Update:  On March 20 I received an email from the seller apologizing that I did not like the product. They said they were going to refund my money. Then I received a second set of headphones in the mail.  The reason I return the first that was because they were too heavy on my head. Getting another set will not solve that problem.",0
4.0,"Comfort and Good sound, that everyone else can hear","September 4, 2018",Yes,"Very comfortable to wear. Using the EQ on my iPod i was able to get better sound but thats not my issue. I had a dead silent room and turned down the headphones all the way, ipod all the way up, and slowly raised the volume and after 4 or so clicks of the headphone volume I could faintly hear the music my friend was listening to. I planned on using these on the plane but I think I'll be distracting people next to me. I know planes can have that loud hum going on and you have to increase the volume to drown it out. Will definitely have to return these and get a better set that doesn't bleed music or sound. If not for being on a plane I would 100% keep these for my desk at work or working out.",0
3.0,"Just headphones, not really noise cancelling...","January 31, 2018",Yes,"Good alternative, but these headphones don't do much for noise cancellation. They are only muffled because of the headphones themselves. I took these to the airport but could still hear EVERYTHING around me, just slightly quieter. Not to mention, these are really heavy/bulky! You can't look down without them sliding off or without your neck hurting. Honestly, I would just invest in a better pair of earphones. I'm giving these away.",0
5.0,Great for the price!,"November 13, 2018",Yes,I really am pleased with these headphones! I was little weary about purchasing them because I have a pair of beats headphones that I love to use. I unfortunately gave up using my beats because I have a mophie case and cannot find an adapter/dongle that works with the case. I love that these are wireless and they produce a great sound. They are comfortable to wear and have a great battery life.,0
5.0,These headphones are great! Only big issue is it bleeds some sound ...,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great!..Only big issue is it bleeds some sound through the joint that makes each earcup pivot. Also, in comparison to my Beats studio pair I notice the quality in sound isn't as rich. But for the price it's not a big deal for me. These will be great for someone who wants a Bluetooth set and just wants to be productive at their desk. Not for someone who wants an equal replacement to their Beats or Bose headphones. I'm super happy!",0
2.0,Would not work with Windows 7,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"I could not get this to work with Windows 7.  While it did pair successfully with my bluetooth, and was seen by the PC with no issues, the drivers for the headphones could not be found, so it wouldn't install, and therefore I couldn't use it.  I checked the manufacture's website, but could not find any drivers for these headphones there.",0
5.0,"Good sound, easy to set up","August 29, 2018",Yes,"For quite some time I had been struggling with a bad set of wireless headphones, but thought it was just a problem with the computer's sound card. It was a very pleasant surprise to listen to my favorite music through these new headphones. No need to change the card, just change the headset!",0
5.0,Would not recommend unless you want to use these connected through the ...,"May 9, 2018",Yes,"I contacted support but only received a canned macro response of bluetooth pairing instructions. They worked well for about a week, after that week they keep switching to an extremely low quality. I got these for editing video content, and I can't hardly make out the words the actors are saying in dialogue because of the quality. Would not recommend unless you want to use these connected through the headphone jack...which defeats the purpose of them being wireless...edit: I received an email from the company, but only after posting this 2 star review with the above text. They sent me a new pair that work perfectly - no issues to report at all. Thanks for making it right, Patozon!",0
4.0,"Works, cheap, stylish","October 3, 2018",Yes,"For the money, this is a good headset. Whether working out or walking to the printer from my office, this has helped me shut out noise and keep my noise from bothering others. There is some delay in turning on due to bluetooth's limitations. Works well with Apple computers and phones.",0
2.0,Definately NOT for working out.,"March 13, 2018",Yes,I bought these for the sole purpose of using them during my workouts and because fitness people recommended them.  They didn't work out for me.  They were ok when I was running because they didn't entirely slip off BUT I did have to keep adjusting them.  When using them during my weight lifting exercises on the bench they completely slipped off my head and had to put them on after each set.  They do sound good so I'll give them that much.  I am bummed that they didn't stay on.  Perhaps they need some kind of material that doesn't slip off the head or something to hold them in place...perhaps make them tighter?,0
5.0,Really like them now,"November 30, 2017",Yes,"I bought a pair of the headphones and they were absolutely terrible. But the customer service was really great and helpful and replaced them for me. Now that I've had a chance to thoroughly test the new ones out, I really like them. They work fine, people can hear me when I call them, and the sound quality is just fine. I'm currently satisfied with them.",1
5.0,Great headphones! Great sound and fit - reasonable price. Better than much more expensive ones we've tried.,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"This is our third pair for our family. Got a set for each of my teenage boys and I kept borrowing them so I got myself a pair! Set up for my Chromebook was so easy, sound is amazing and fit is very comfortable. Both my boys have sensory issues so we have been through a lot of headsets and earbuds. These are the only ones we've stuck with and all we use. Couldn't ask for better.",0
4.0,Fair Sound But Great Value,"October 24, 2017",Yes,"Sounds like you're are the bottom of a well, but it's:.- comfortable.- good build quality.- pairs easily and reliably.- play/pause and volume controls are easy to use..Sound quality is at best three stars, but all other aspects are good which makes this a pretty damn good value. Not my favorite headset, but this is my 12 year old son's and he likes it and uses it without problems with his iPad and Chromebook.",0
2.0,"Before you buy, look at the weight of these.","January 18, 2018",Yes,"Take warning from me, these are heavy and do not adjust except to get larger.  I probably would have kept the headphones if they could have been adjusted to a smaller size, but due to weight, I wouldn't have used them much.",1
5.0,Will Update as time goes by.,"October 19, 2018",Yes,"So Far so Good.  10-18-18.  Just installed for my mom.  Push button for two seconds and on, 5 seconds and off.  I put the headsets volume to max so my mom could use the TV remote for the volume.  Super easy pair, super easy use.  I did not pair a phone, or computer to this headset.",0
5.0,I like!,"March 9, 2018",Yes,"This came on time, a day early in fact, intact and was easy to use. I dont use the blue-tooth as I got them for work to help mute the noise and they do the trick. While I can still hear others, it does bring their volume down. I find them to be comfortable and I like that they fold and get smaller, which will work great when traveling.",0
5.0,Excellent headphones at a good price from a reliable seller,"January 7, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great for the price. The audio quality is good, the headphones fold up nicely, and it's easy to set up the bluetooth. The headphones fit comfortably on my head as well and can be adjusted. I would recommend that anyone who wants a portable, solid set of headphones and isn't obsessed about top-notch sound quality should purchase these...I ended up returning my set because they stopped working after a couple of months, and the customer service was extremely helpful and prompt. Normally I'd be a bit upset that they broke, but the ease of getting them replaced under the warranty made up for it.",0
5.0,Amazing and can be used anywhere.,"March 16, 2018",Yes,"I absolutely love them. You can not only adjust the volume on your iPhone, but also on your headphones. It’s 2 separate volumes. Even then, you don’t need them on full blast to ignore the world at the gym or where you walking. Sometimes if you pass by other people using Bluetooth headphones, it skips a little in the song but nothing to really worry about. It’s so useful and you can take it everywhere. And even if I forget to charge it, I have the cord it comes with in the carrying case they gave out (the little fabric one) so I can’t even be without my music for a second. But 20 hours is also longer than you think. It’s also able to connect with multiple devices at a time, so when I get back home, I came in and open my laptop and it will switch to that. Best purchase I’ve made in quite a while for headphones.",0
4.0,great customer service - replaced defective pair,"January 14, 2018",Yes,"I had a problem with the original pair I purchased and, without asking, the company sent me a new pair free of charge. They are back to being my go to gym headphones. I am there 7 days a week, 2 or more hours a day, so they get a beating and they stand up to it...Below is my original review (forgive me):..These are my cheaper gym headphones; I expect to sweat while wearing them, saving my Bose for walks and airplanes. But while they may be less expensive, it was frustrating to just have them die three months after buying them.",1
5.0,Work for me and I'm 73!,"October 30, 2018",Yes,I'm still figuring how to push all the right buttons but the MPOW headphones I got seem great to me.  I couldn't read the small print in the enclosed operating booklet and I emailed MOW to send me a link to an online manual.  I got that link the next day.  It worked wonderfully for me!  I snipped the parts I needed and printed them off.  Thanks for your wonderful support team!,0
4.0,"Great wireless capabilities, adequate audio quality.","February 27, 2018",Yes,"These Mpow 059 bluetooth headphones are great entry-level headphones, especially as a second or travel pair. The build quality is excellent at this low price point, and they're pretty comfortable. Pairing is easy and painless, and being able to use them as standard plug-in headphones when the battery dies is pretty cool. The only mediocre aspect is the audio quality; it's ok, but not great. It's more than adequate for speech, but I wouldn't recommend the audio quality for a primary pair of headphones. It's great for things like audiobooks or phone/video chats, and for music it's tolerable. These are great headphones if you just need an easy-to-carry pair or a backup pair, and don't mind music quality not being top-notch.",0
5.0,Just remember to plug them in,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"I've had these for two weeks and I don't have any complaints. There's plenty of bass, the Bluetooth works perfectly well, the battery life is impressive, in retrospect...just remember that leaving them plugged into the headphone jack does not charge them. I will admit to wondering why the battery was discharging so quickly until I remembered the USB charger. Not my smartest moment.",0
5.0,Great Headphones,"March 30, 2018",Yes,"These are the first blue tooth headphones I've ever purchased and I'm glad I did. They sound great and have a nice bass. Very clear sound, amazing battery life &amp; an affordable price. Two things I'd like to advise are if you wear them for 30 minutes or longer they can start to hurt your ears. Another thing is the blue light constantly blinking can be annoying in the dark, still not something I'd take a star off for. I compared these to my friends Solo Beats and these sound just as good in my opinion.",0
5.0,these are surprisingly awesome. Great balance of bass and treble,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"While not on the same level as BOSE.....these are surprisingly awesome. Great balance of bass and treble. Battery lasts forever. I got these last year and they are STILL holding up strong...My only issue is that I have big ol ears and after 30-60 minutes, I get that ol fashioned feeling in my ears that only a lack of blood could bring...If I ever bought a new pair of wireless headphones, it would be to remedy this issue.",0
5.0,Great Bang for the Buck,"October 25, 2018",Yes,"These are the best headphones I have ever had! The battery is amazing &amp; the music quality is amazing. If you're on the city bus for example &amp; you want to tune out annoying sounds, just put these on &amp; bye-bye noises! 😄The bluetooth phone part i give 4 stars outta 5 because sometimes it cuts in &amp; out. It's like 3/10 for me on that.  It doesnt block the sound of a city bus or traffic at times for the person on the other end. It is super easy to turn off &amp; on. And they feel really comfortable on your ears cuz of the material. Plus, the pink color is rocking and i always sport them around my neck so I dont set them down somewhere.",0
5.0,Incredible Wireless Headphones!,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"I unfortunately had to purchase new Bluetooth headphones after my old Beats ear piece broke and became unusable. I was not expecting too much from these based on the price, but so far I’ve been blown away at how great they are! The headphones allow for extra detail not heard when listening to the radio or using speakers, fit very nicely around and over both ears for a closed sound (not noise cancelling), and overall are very easy to operate.",0
4.0,Great product &amp; customer service,"April 16, 2018",Yes,"They are great headphones, until the button fell off after a month &amp; it doesn't work without it..*** update: after my review the company contacted me and offered a replacement even though I was beyond my return period of return. I didn't even reach out to them they reached out to me and resolve the issue quickly and efficiently with no problem.",0
3.0,they paired quickly and easily. However,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"Most of the reviews I looked at spoke highly of the audio quality, but I'm afraid I haven't been impressed. I bought these primarily for cord-free use with my PC, and, to their credit, they paired quickly and easily. However, there's a noticeable pause and faint click every time they activate, and a soft static noise that continues through use and for a few seconds after audio playback ends, after which they seem to ""switch off."" The buzzing is less distinct if I'm listening to music, but gets quite distracting with spoken-word media - and that's unfortunate, because I do a lot of audio editing. I'm really torn on whether to keep them: I like the fit, but they don't even compare favorably to my $12 earbuds in terms of overall sound quality.",0
1.0,What are they saying?,"March 30, 2018",Yes,"I recently bought a second pair of these.  The first was returned because they didn't hold a charge. Decided to give it another try. These hold the charge great.  The main problem here, is that they don't like to sync to the video you are watching. "" So, if you like to watch one thing while hearing another, then these headphones are for you.""",0
2.0,What bass?,"September 4, 2018",Yes,"I bought these because of the rave reviews and that the bass was deep and crisp. Well, that was a lie. The headphones are comfy for the small amount of time that i wore them but i went to 3 different ""go to songs"" and the sound was very flat. Even with the volume turned all the way up it sounded like i had the ""natural"" sound setting on. If you are looking for a pair of headphones that last a long time, flashy, and comfy then these are for you. If you are looking for a pair of headphones that you can feel some type of normal bass then look elsewhere",0
5.0,1st inexpensive wireless hp I wld buy again,"April 9, 2018",Yes,Super comfortable! Clear sound. I set these up without the directions easy! I forgot to bring the direx with me on the train and I couldn't find them online. I still was able to set them up. I bought them in pink - pretty. I've gone through a lot of wireless headphones. This is the first inexpensive pair I would buy again.,0
5.0,Reasonable sound quality with good isolation from outside noise.,"September 26, 2017",Yes,"I got these to use while mowing the yard.  The sound isolation is very good.  Of course I still hear the mower but it is not as loud as it is when I wear sound isolating earbuds so the music comes thru better.  The sound quality is decent, not great.  Bass is heavy and treble is OK.  No comparison to my Sennheiser cans, but hey, I got these to use mowing the lawn.  For the price and application they are fine.",0
5.0,Great Bluetooth headphones,"September 6, 2017",Yes,Great headphones. We own 2 pairs. They pair easily with iPads. Goood sound. Batterlife is good. My 9 and 6 year olds love them. Very reasonable price. They fit their heads well on the smaller settings...and can easily fit an adult head if expanded.,1
5.0,VERY happy with this headset,"August 22, 2017",Yes,"VERY happy with this headset.  Pairs easy with Bluetooth units.  I have a high frequency hearing loss in both ears so it is a BIG help to me to hear and understand what is being said when watching TV.  Also have it paired to my I-Pod for my music.  So far I'd only had to charge it twice, once initially, and then after 3 days of use.  For the money paid I cannot be happier.  GREAT product.  Bill",0
1.0,Poor Performance after short use,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"After only a month and a half the headphones stopped connecting to my iPhone, and they connected only once to my laptop before refusing to work.  Too bad because the unit is attractive and comfortable.  I'm very dissatisfied.",1
4.0,Pretty cool-- just not good for my head shape.,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"The wireless feature works great. And I love that I can lie down on my side with these on, putting the weight of my head on them. However, my head might be narrow, but it is annoying because my head is not wide enough to hold them up, so the top of my head has to, which is uncomfortable. They are not tight around my ears, is what I mean. I am an adult woman, btw. I also couldn't find a case that would fit them online. Let me know if you have any suggestions. Also, another annoying thing is that the blue light that is supposed to flash when the battery is low starts flashing after about half an hour or less of use, but I might contact customer service about that soon.",0
4.0,good wireless headphones,"September 8, 2018",Yes,Very comfortable... great sound. Paired easily with my iPhone 6 s plus.. would recommend to anyone looking for comfortable wireless headphones.. I got mine in pink and they came quickly..  battery life is 15-20 hours and it takes 4 hours to charge them..  not sure if it can pair with iPad Air 2 but i mostly listen to music on my phone anyway..  they came charged right out of the box,1
4.0,Overall it is good headphones for the price,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"Updated review of Mpow 059 and H1. First some common features I noted. (1) Both models sound very good. (2) Both headphones are made with quality material. (3) Both models could be worn for hours without any discomfort. (4) Both models could sell for lot more than what you could buy from Amazon. They are terrific value! Now the looks: look and feel are subjective, I prefer the look and feel of H1 (you might think different). Now about their customer care. They are absolutely the best! Go try H1 or 059 you will be happy. I hope this review helps other shoppers like me, who are very analytical. Thank you",0
5.0,"Clear sound, comfortable headphones, long battery life.","March 4, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have great sound, bluetooth capability, work like regular headphones with the jack plug, and are quite comfortable. And the battery life has been really nice. I am pretty impressed so far!..Update: We had these for about a month, and they were great! Battery life was impressive, and they sounded really good. Unfortunately, they were stolen, so I will not be able to update regarding durability.",0
4.0,Good for the price,"October 25, 2018",Yes,"For a pair of headphones under $50, they are really good. Nice sound quality, good battery life, and comfortable. After a little over a year, the ear-covers where falling apart and I was getting little black flakes on my face. And battery life also significantly diminished. However, they were very worn, and I used them almost every day for long hours at a time. Not perfect, but you won't find a better set of headphones at this price.",0
3.0,Hurts the top of my head,"August 24, 2017",Yes,"I like the sound quality, the price and the way these headphones block out surrounding noise. But the padding on the top underside of the headphones drives me insane. It physically hurts the top of my head, no matter how much I adjust the fit and extend the sides (it actually just sort of droops sadly down when I extend each side). My boyfriend and I bought the headphones at the same time and he has the same issue with them (so it's a problem for male and female head size). I ended up taping down the padding so it was less cushy, which helped only slightly.",1
5.0,Inexpensive but great sound,"March 12, 2018",Yes,The headphones present a nice balance of highs and lows and maintain mid range vocals true and responsive.  The headphones paired easily with devices.  The ability to either use through blue tooth connection or wired connection is nice if you lose power.  I wish there were a way to know how much charge is left on the headphones.,0
5.0,"So far, really good","August 15, 2017",Yes,"So far so good. Bought this week as headphones to use while doing yard work. They feel great, did well with sweating. Sound was loud enough to hear over the mower and blower,but it won't blow you away. Phone mic is okay, works well enuff, but nothing to write home about. I Def can't use this for podcasting or anything more than a quick call here or there. Overall I'm very happy for the price.",0
4.0,Very useful,"September 8, 2018",Yes,I have enjoyed these headphones for about a week now and I must say the bluetooth stays incredibly well connected for a good distance and allows me much more mobility than wired earbuds. They are also generally comfortable for a decent amount of time as long as they are not worn to long for any one sitting. I am not sure if my ear shape is just weird though as the outer ridges of my ear do feel somewhat squished over time after wearing the headphones for too long. All otherwise I would recommend these headphones for mobility and general comfort.,0
5.0,Sound quality is better than my direct plug head phones,"March 6, 2018",Yes,"My first Bluetooth head phones and all i can say is WOW. Sound quality is better than my direct plug head phones. Reception distance is outstanding. Basement to the 2nd floor in my home, NO breakup. Control buttons blend and look good, but are a little hard to use for an older gent like me. No touch feel to them but work perfect when you get use to where they are. very light and comfortable for me.",0
4.0,Recommend.,"October 7, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for my pre-teen daughter about two months ago.  She has really enjoyed them.  I've borrowed them a couple times and was impressed with the sound quality for the price.  4 stars for controls layout...the controls are all smooth and not easily identifiable by touch.  I'm sure once used on a regular basis will become muscle memory, but I had to remove them to look at the controls for adjustments.  I'd still recommend and am considering purchasing an additional pair.",0
3.0,"Unimpressive sounding, low quality headphones","June 20, 2017",Yes,"My least favorite thing about reading headphone reviews is when someone says they ""sound good for the price"".  What exactly does that mean?. We primarily use headphones to play music.  Ideally, we want the music to sound like we are in the same room with the people making it.  Either headphones sound good or they do not..Some low cost headphones sound extremely clear and lifelike.  Others, sound like you're listening to music underwater, or in a room far away, or a tunnel, or with a wet towel wrapped around your head.  These headphones fall in the second category.  The music sounds muffled and flat.  Like you are listening to it trough a wall.  Have a few pair of in-ear Bluetooth headphones that sound at least twice as good as these.  Being larger, you'd expect them to have a lot more ability to make them sound better than earbuds.  Not the case here.  Besides the poor sound, they creak on your head and just feel cheap...Bottom line:  Unimpressive headphones all around.  Flat, muddy, muffled sound.  Cheap build quality.  Acceptable comfort and looks.  Unless they'll be used by kids or people who really don't care how their music sounds, I'd recommend saving a little more and getting better headphones.",4
5.0,This is a great pair of headsets,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"This is a great pair of headsets, the sound quality is nice, the material you can also tell right away is good. The best feature of these headsets I would have to say is the ability to connect to 2 devices at once. The fit was slightly too tight for me, but the cushions around the ears make prolonged wear and use tolerable, even with glasses.",1
5.0,They fit well and sound good. I've never purchased so I don't have anything ...,"September 6, 2017",Yes,I needed some bluetooth headphones but didn't want to break the bank. They fit well and sound good. I've never purchased so I don't have anything to compare them too. I do play instruments though so I have a good ear. I like the features. Easy to link to several devices. The mic picks up your voice well. The battery life is song. Highly recommend. Shipping was super fast with prime.,0
5.0,NICE SET...but...NOT Over the ear but on ear...,"March 13, 2017",Yes,"No issues what so ever...the headphones work great and are very comfortable for on ear headphones(they are not over ear as they set on your ear) but, especially the padding on the top keeps the plastic off my shaved head...paired easy and stayed paired, no repairing after turning off...very satisfied and do recommend...",1
5.0,"Great for running/working out, great buy!","March 13, 2018",Yes,I have had these for 5 months now and work great. I wear them running and working out and they’re great. They do not bob around on your head and they are pretty good and noise canceling too. I don’t see any use of wear and tear yet. The quality was much higher than I expected for the price. It’s a good buy!,1
1.0,was good started going bad,"November 1, 2017",Yes,Headphones worked for a couple of months now they keep disconnecting from devices..Edit: they sent me a new one is having issues,2
5.0,Good quality for a good price,"August 14, 2018",Yes,"This product is AMAZING. The sound quality is amazing, the bluetooth feature comes in handy a lot, it has wireless back up in case you can't find the Mpow on your laptop or phone. It comes in flashy colors to show of to your friends. The in-built mic is great for calling friends. I can bring it anywhere with the foldible feature. It even comes with a small bag to put your headphones and other chargers and wires in. The right ear has every button you need to forward, call, and adjust volume.  All of these features for such a great price. Other brands are selling these same headphones for a hundred dollars more. Thanks Mpow for these fantastic headphones",0
5.0,Good value for money,"September 26, 2018",Yes,Works great. Good value for money...My only grip (and it's a small one) is that the controls on the right could have a little notches for me to feel with my fingers.,2
5.0,Great set of headphones for the price,"November 24, 2017",Yes,Bought this for our Grandson; he says sound is great and they fit very well. Easy connection to his I-pad. I used them a few times I decided to purchase a set for myself. These cordless headphones are very comfortable over long periods ( 3-4 hours). They connect t my IPod and IPad easily and I enjoy being able to listen to music or radio without being tied down.,0
5.0,"Good durability, Good Battery, Comfortable Fit.","February 24, 2018",Yes,"Work like a charm.  Occasional interference over bluetooth, but all in all, I'm very happy with this product...My favorite part is the battery time.  I forget to charge these things constantly, and still have yet to have the batteries go completely dead on me once...Ears can get a little sweaty after a while, but thats just because its a secure fit for clean sound with a very comfortable fitting material...I wear these at work doing very heavy labor and they've taken quite a beating and carried on already...Would buy again, and I'm a picky purchaser.",0
4.0,These headphones are amazing. First,"January 18, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are amazing. First, I love the color. Second, they are very comfortable to wear and fold up nicely. I love that I can plug these in to the audio books at the library or go wireless Bluetooth to my computer, allowing me to listen to my textbooks as I do things around the house. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they don't completely cancel noise. However, they do a very decent job and weren't advertised to cancel.",0
4.0,Kind of disappointing (Update with customer service),"August 3, 2018",Yes,"I know that most of the other people don't have this problem, but I hear static buzzing whenever there is sound. It is faint but distracting and now I can't focus on anything but the buzzing when I listen..update, the customer service contacted me in the same way they seem to do well with everyone else. they are giving me a replacement and I have yet to get it but good customer service",1
5.0,I needed something good but inexpensive,"December 2, 2017",Yes,"I initially ordered this product because I needed a good set and inexpensive. I recieved a possible damaged one but the company contacted me and replaced it with a new one. I have been using the new one for about two weeks now and seems that they work well. The clarity of the music is fine and able to answe a call. The volume is good enough I wish it was more but I understand that it’s not healthy for us but other thank that, I recommend the product and appreciate the company replacing the initial product that I received defective. I do feel that the quality and the prize is good and recommend.",5
5.0,Killer Headphones!,"July 24, 2018",Yes,"I got these to wear when I go to the gym, because my Beats earbuds kept coming out. They don’t sound as good as the Beats, but they still sound great! The Bluetooth connects right away to my iPhone and they stay on with no problem when I’m on the treadmill or elliptical. You can’t beat them for the price either.",0
5.0,Surprisingly good quality headphones for a great price!!,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"I was absolutely surprised by these headphones given the reviews.  Because of the price point, I did not expect good quality sound but I needed something for the gym when my ear buds kept falling out. Sound quality is actually really good, they are comfortable over my ears and the controls are easy to use. Easy to pair with my phone and I would definitely recommend these to a friend.",0
5.0,Great Headset For Long Sessions (Gaming and Streaming),"April 15, 2018",Yes,"This headset is fantastic after my first weekend with it. Sound quality is great as is the noise cancellation and they're very comfortable for long wear. These actually replaced a set of Beats I had but one of the folding hinges broke on those and I didn't want to spend the same price again. At the price point these sell at they're more than comparable. The only slight I have on this pair is they seem to turn on at full volume, so the voice stating they're turned on and connected is loud, so I wouldn't recommend having them on at power on. There's probably a setting I can adjust this with, but haven't found it yet. No regrets with this purchase and would definitely recommend them.",0
5.0,Sound and quality are unbelievable for this cost point.,"November 2, 2018",Yes,I cannot believe the low cost for these.  They are built solid.  They are not cheaply made at all.  They are very comfortable over the ears.  The battery lasts for a long time...charge super fast.  Love the storage bag that came with it.  Honestly look high end.  Very very happy.,0
5.0,High Quality with Value,"June 26, 2017",Yes,"I buy a lot from Amazon, and I enjoy most of my products and the savings I get, but rarely write a review because I'm fat and happy with it. However, I am amazed after several weeks with this product how well it serves my needs and gives a premium quality sound for the cheap throwaway price...Beats headphones and similar HD audio headphones may have a slightly clearer sound, but at $200 a pop versus $35 for 9.5/10 of equivalent experience, this is a much better buy, and the added features such as Controls on the headphones, and a microphone for phone calls, just adds even more value...Features:..Comfort:The headphones are heavily padded as well the head piece. You can wear these for hours when uninterrupted...Wireless BT: They work perfectly with both my phone and computer. It is able to automatically connect with either immediately. So far the range has reached 35 feet (the end of my apartment) with no loss...Sound: It does contain surround sound. I am completely immersed in the audio, picking up quiet details I didn't receive from my monitor or TV. You will notice the Surround when gaming, footsteps for example tell you which direction sounds are emanating. I am able to blast my music/games and not disturb my girlfriend while she sleeps only a few feet away...Microphone: There is no directional stick on this set, but I am able to talk in a normal voice on phone calls without having to repeat myself...Controls: Very simple to program and use. It gives audio feedback when powering on/off or maxing internal volume. The start/stop and next/previous buttons are perfect for gaming while also listening to music. I can run media player in background and use custom soundtrack while playing a game. I am able to switch songs or pause them when needed to without having to get up...Battery Life: I have yet to have to stop listening due to needing to charge. The cable given is very short so I can't use it while charging. I use it for hours a day and only charge it up every few days with no issues...Sturdiness: The materials used are strong without being overly heavy. The plastic locks for head size adjustment are very sturdy and don't slip in use...Very happy with this product.",6
5.0,Amazing!,"October 27, 2017",Yes,"Bought these on an impulse because I'd been looking for a pair of over ear headphones to replace my beats on ear ones and the price was right. Was ready to be annoyed by crappy quality, but was pleasantly surprised to discover that not only is the sound quality is amazing for the price, but  that all of the buttons work with my phone (play/pause, forward and back, volume up and down) which is rarely the case for android phones. I love that these work with both Bluetooth and wired connections, which offers a great bit of versatility lacking in most headphones. They also look very expensive for $36 headphones, I'm pretty sure anyone looking at them will think they cost a fortune. Would definitely buy again, and will now have this brand on my radar!",0
5.0,Definitely a 5 star purchase for me!,"September 30, 2017",Yes,"So far, I've been very pleased. I wear hearing aids and am able to use the headphones with or without them. I listened to a podcast the other night while driving in my pickup with lots of outside noise (rain, wind, etc) and it was still very clear. I like the fact that they are not noise cancelling in order to hear other sounds, voices as needed. I've used them to watch TV. My wife (and probably the neighbors!!) appreciated me wearing them. It was great being able to watch and hear an entire show without my wife and I turning the volume up,down, up, down! I haven't yet, but plan to use them while working out in the mornings (walking, riding my bike, etc). I've only had them for a short time, but for the price and already what they've done for me, I'm very happy.",0
5.0,Exceeded my Expectations,"July 25, 2017",Yes,"I'll start by saying that I purchased these mostly for podcasts and watching sports/video games on my phone. I just needed something that could handle spoken word for the most part. I did test with some music as well...I've used these for about a day now and I'm pretty impressed for the price. They perform very well in the mid to high frequencies. My only complaint is the lack of bass output - however I expected it to be worse than it is so that was a nice surprise...The Bluetooth connection does really well. I tested it out and I could walk 20-25 feet away from my phone before any issues were detected...For music I think I'll buy a more expensive set, likely the QC35's just because I like to feel my brain rattle which isn't what these can offer. But for what I bought these for they're awesome!..I'll definitely buy these for my mom and dad who also go on walks and work in the yard and these would be great for them.",0
3.0,Blue lights keeps blinking and never stops,"July 18, 2017",Yes,"Work great sound great but the blue light keeps blinking for some reason? How do you turn the blinking blue light off? And yes it is fully charged, it also doesn't say connected anymore when it does connect. They do connect and work but the blue light blinks constantly for some reason, is that normal when listening to music? It's very annoying in the dark. The instructions don't say anything on that.",0
5.0,Great sound and VERY durable.,"May 5, 2018",Yes,Very durable and excellent sound quality.  Purchased this a year ago for an autistic/bi polar young adult.  Every set up headphones purchased over the years did not last more that 6 months.  The only downside is they are a bit clunky but this is what it makes the durable.  These are so good I got one for myself.,0
4.0,Slightly uncomfortable but worth the money,"August 23, 2018",Yes,"Good battery life, Always 15+ hours for me. Only 2-3 hours for full charge. Good sound. Only negatives for me is the headband is uncomfortable for hours of use, a couple hours might be fine. Also sound leaks a lot so if you use them a lot in quiet or crowded places people near can hear your headphones.",0
2.0,QC issues?,"January 31, 2018",Yes,"The side opposite the control button has low output, yes I switched ears, but the volume isn't equal on both sides. There was a slight humming background noise. Listened for an hour before bed. Woke up in the morning with a splitting headache for half a day. Reminded me of the Cuban Embassy noise issue and I haven't got the nerve to use them again.",0
4.0,Pretty decent foe the money,"July 2, 2017",Yes,"I was pleasantly surprised at these!  For the price, I didn't have sky-high expectations.  The sound seems a little muffled on the trebble side and there is no way to adjust the trebble/base balance, but I like the voice prompts to tell you when it is powering down or syncing to bluetooth etc.  They are comfortable and sturdy and the included cord let me plug into the airplane's onboard entertainment on a recent trip I took.  Overall a good product for bluetooth headset on a budget.  I did not test the microphone, as I only use them for entertainment.",0
5.0,Love these headphones,"May 18, 2018",Yes,I love my headphones to use on the computer for myself due to my family taking over my headphones (another brand) not even close as nice as these and I would definitely recommend these I only wish I brought them in pink to keep my adult sons from using them. Now they're wanting a pair for themselves.,0
5.0,"Gave the headphones as a gift for the wife, ...","March 23, 2018",Yes,"Initially I was disappointed with the headsets as a vital piece broke off.  However, the response I received and quick actions in getting a replacement, could not have been better.  Very Pleased and would purchase these again...Thank you very much!!!",1
5.0,Good buy,"March 9, 2018",Yes,"I got these to help block out some noise at work and they’re pretty cool. Very comfortable. Stays charged for a long time. Good sound quality. It does suck a tiny bit that if I turn the volume up all the way others can hear my music, but eh...I can’t hear them so haha oh well. Worth the price. They feel more expensive than they are.",0
5.0,Super sound quality and good BT range,"May 12, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my daughter's birthday and she is all into the name brands,but these had better reviews for sound quality, so I saved a couple hundred bucks and got these along with the case...The fact that they were not Beats brand was not an issue after she heard the sound quality and experienced the BT range.",0
5.0,Great headphones!!,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"I really like these headphones. I wear them around the house and to work out in. They are easy to use after a small learning curve. I like that they are very comfortable, durable, and the sound is excellent. They stay charged a very long time. They fold up nicely as well. Just what I was hoping for and more.  I find it funny that I'm hearing new words to songs that I have been listening to all my life because the sound is so clear!  I highly recommend these headphones.",0
5.0,Awesome Sound,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"These bluetooth headphones came as a recommendation for their great sound and incredible price. They have both. I have a pair of Sony's that cost 4 times as much and deliver 1/10 the sound quality. Yes the Sony's came with a great case and a downloadable app that gives you a bunch of different preset EQ's. But none of that compares to the out and out sound quality of the Mpow 059. These are the only headphones that come close to my Shure earbuds. And again, a lot less money. IMHO",0
5.0,Best Headphones I've Owned,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"By far the best set of headphones I've owned! I use them mainly at the gym, i find they do drown out 99% of the sound at the gym, or maybe I'm just in my zone and don't hear the outside noise, either or, the charge last forever, they feel great on your ears, the sound is great, and the set up is super easy! They've been splashed by water, dropped, and even left outside, and still work perfect! And i love how easy it is to use the buttons on the side! The only draw back, the Bluetooth only reaches 30 feel, so you can't go very far from your phone or the music cuts out :(",0
4.0,Great for the price,"October 11, 2017",Yes,"I just received these in a few hours ago. I wanted to test the comfort factor and after 2 hours of use I have no complaints. The build quality feels better than expected, they are a bit heavy, but nothing that you can't get used to. So far the sound quality is ok via bluetooth. I would give the sound quality a medium rating as of now. I will update this review after a few weeks of use and a comparison with the wired connection. If you have a big head, these should be more than enough to compensate.Also these cover my whole ear, so I am very happy about that.",0
4.0,I like them a lot because that's all I was looking ...,"May 21, 2018",Yes,"You get what you pay for with these headphones. They are a basic over-ear headphone but are nothing special.  I like them a lot because that's all I was looking for and wasn't willing to pay the money for higher end products. These do really well blocking out ambient noise on planes so that you don't blast your ear drums out with ear buds, and are also perfect for blocking out the chit chat when I'm trying to buckle down at work.  They have a certain cheapness feel to them but if you just need something basic and aren't a sound quality nerd, these are great!",0
5.0,Can't believe how awesome these are!,"May 11, 2017",Yes,"I am using my wife's account, FYI...but let me start by saying this, I never leave a review on any product. These headphones are absolutely awesome. I bought them to see if they would cancel out the sound of my big zero turn mower when I mowed, and it is amazing the sound quality of these things. I use them when I workout as well and they stay on my head no matter what I am doing. Also, the battery life on these is crazy, I charged them fully when I first got them several weeks ago, and they aren't even halfway drained yet. I will most likely purchase another pair of these in the near future, just to have a pair at home and at the office, although the carrying case makes it easy to throw them in my bag and go. AWESOME PRODUCT!! I have been recommending them to everyone. Best $35 I have spent in a very long time. Great Job!",0
4.0,"Good headphones, but poor interface.","March 30, 2018",Yes,"They are pretty good headphones for the price. I use them to listen to music at work. They do allow for up to 2 devices to connect at a time, but it can take some practice to get that to happen. They  do have a few drawbacks though:..They cannot play music over Bluetooth while charging..They have a complex interface. The play/pause button is used for 4 different functions depending on exactly hoe long you hold it..They do not always reconnect to my devices when powering on.",0
5.0,My daughter loves these,"April 16, 2018",Yes,"I know this is going to sound unbelievable but at Christmas I purchased Bose headphones for both of my children. My daughter wanted another pair but I didn't want to spend that much money because the Bose broke which my kids can be rough on things, so I purchased these for under $40. She likes these much better than the Bose she says they fit better around her ears and stay on her head better she just loves them all around and now my son wants a pair. Go figure spend 300 on a pair of headphones and they prefer the $40 pair. I was skeptical I must admit but the reviews convinced me to make the purchase and I thought for $40 it's worth a shot. They have been worth every penny!!!!",0
5.0,Comfortable and great price,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for my husband who is a software engineer and wanted a decent pair of headphones to help him block out sound while at the office. He said they're comfortable, provide light noise cancellation (fyi, these are not described as noise cancelling headphones) and have great sound. The price was great and they're just what we were looking for.",0
5.0,A price/performer for over the ear phones,"July 3, 2017",Yes,"These are the most versatile earphones I have tried. The voice response to the wearer's input pushes are very creative. The price is great and the sound quality is excellent. I don't yet know their useful life, but do not care.. I will buy a second set if they fail In a year..",1
5.0,Great sound &amp; lightweight,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"Item is exactly what I expected.  Fits comfortably &amp; soft cushion on the inside of headband. Light weight, Ear cushions fit nicely on my ears.  Sound is great- will use for music &amp; audio books. Charged quickly.  Only have used it a few times in the week I've had them. Folds easily &amp; fits in the carry bag- no need to buy a case. <a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Mpow-059-Bluetooth-Headphones-Over-Ear-Hi-Fi-Stereo-Wireless-Headset-Foldable-Soft-Memory-Protein-Earmuffs-w-Built-in-Mic-and-Wired-Mode-for-PC-Cell-Phones-TV/dp/B07585JXNZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mpow 059 Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headset, Foldable, Soft Memory-Protein Earmuffs, w/ Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/ Cell Phones/ TV</a>",0
3.0,I’d spend more or go another route,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"First, they don’t sound bad. I look for clean and clear bass when listening to headphones and these don’t provide that. Don’t get me wrong, they are very comfortable and sound very clear, but my taste is just a bit more expensive. Why did I buy a cheaper pair? Good question. No idea.",1
2.0,They look good. Sound BAD!,"August 22, 2017",Yes,"I wanted to like these headphones. They look good, and the material is comfortable. However, the most important part of headphones is the audio quality, and unfortunately, these do not deliver. If you are trying to listen to music on these headphones, you will be disappointed, as music sounds like its being played in a distant cave. There is no real clarity to the sound. The microphone is also extremely weak, and people could not understand what I was saying when I tried to use it. Luckily Amazon is allowing me to return them for a refund. I would advise looking elsewhere for better headphones.",1
4.0,Sturdy and attractive ...good value !,"July 18, 2018",Yes,"I'm very happy with my headphones. Work great right out of the box with a little startup charge. I use it while doing chores around the outside and I can crank it up without bothering my neighbors. No problem with my phone in my pocket but I can walk 30 to 35 feet away and still get good reception. The only thing I wish they had done for older people like me who have lost sensitivity in their fingers is to put a ""pimple "" on the center of the on /off button. It would give someone a benchmark they could feel then navigate the other functions easier.  4.75 stars but I'm not offered that option above !",0
3.0,These headphones are ok. Audio quality isn’t really there ...,"March 20, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are ok. Audio quality isn’t really there &amp; they lack bass. Not sure what I was expecting at this price point but I was hopeful audio quality would be somewhat close to my standard iPhone ear buds -not the case. Also, they leak sound really bad. Everyone around you can hear what you’re listening too, even with the volume half way! I ended up giving them to my kid.",0
3.0,its ok for the price and while traveling,"September 25, 2017",Yes,used this for awhile now while traveling and it has good sound but its not loud and once in awhile you loose connection over Bluetooth even is a foot or less away from the device that the music is on. You will get the occasional static too.,1
5.0,"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter, ...","January 15, 2018",Yes,"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who previous owned a very expensive brand name pair of headphones, that didn't last 2 years. I decided never to invest in another expensive pair, so bought what I thought weren't as comparable to the pair she previously owned, only to find that these headphones sound sooo much nicer then the previously owned pair. Goes to show that you may for the name.",0
5.0,Very happy with these headphones.,"September 16, 2017",Yes,"Very happy with these headphones. They are sturdy, hold a charge for a long time, easy to pair, comfortable and block out noise (not entirely). I bought these for work since we sit in an open environment and the noise is so distracting to me. I put on some music and it helps keep me from being bothered by the noise. These are not safety headphones where they block out loud sounds that can damage your hearing. This blocks out people talking and what I call annoying sounds!",0
5.0,Top notch,"May 15, 2018",Yes,"Fantastic sound, encapsulates your ears, Bluetooth has no issues, lithium-ion battery lasts ages, and spoils you rotten. These also come with a nice carrying case and an AUX cable so you don't have to drain the battery if you're at your computer. I bought a second pair for my wife; these are top-of-the-line; can't say enough good things about them.",0
4.0,Good sound for the set.,"November 2, 2017",Yes,"The headset works well and the bluetooth pairs quite easliy. The only con I can give it is the tightness of the headphones over the ear. For a small amount of time, you appreciate it, but since I use it for over an hour at a time, it gets to be a little uncomfortable..If you want the rest of the world to go away when you are listening to your music, these are the set for you.",1
4.0,Very good headphones. Excellent sound quality,"October 14, 2017",Yes,"Very good headphones. Excellent sound quality, great function with bluetooth or with the wired connection. I have had no issues with battery life (although I haven't formally tested how many hours they last). Some drawbacks are that they hurt my ears if I wear them for an hour or so, and the microphone volume is a little low when I make phone calls according to people on the other end. Still well worth the purchase.",0
5.0,"Amazing sound, crystal clear treble and good bass sound ...","January 21, 2018",Yes,"I bought this headphones to pair with I-Phone 8 plus. Amazing sound, crystal clear treble and good bass sound reproduction. I-Phone recognized the headphones via Bluetooth right away. It comes with a user manual with good instructions on 6 different languages. Also comes with a nice pouch to put headphone away when not in use. Great product.",0
4.0,Overall-the acoustics met my expectations!,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"I wanted to be able to connect via Bluetooth to my iPad with headphones and for the price seems to do a great job. Despite the instructions the size of a book of matches and the smallest font available, it was easy to setup and pair with my device. There's no audio adjustments, bass or treble on the phones but this can usually be configured on the source device your paired with- but overall the acoustics met my expectations...My only reservation 4/5 stars, is after wearing them for a few mins they feel a little uncomfortable- almost too tight, and there's no adjustment for this that I could find.",0
4.0,Earphones for the gym,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"The earphones work fine. I find it a bit difficult to insert the charger into the earphones, in part because they are black and its difficult in low light to find the slot. The on-off button seems a little quirky. In general, though, this seems a fine unit. I've only had it a week.",0
5.0,Great quality!,"November 19, 2017",Yes,Pros:.- affordable and wonderful quality!.- comes w a cord in case you lose battery! NOT ALL Bluetooth headphones have this option!.- foldable for travel.- easily connects w phone.- good sound quality..Cons:.- comes w a soft case instead of hard one (if you have to pack them in a suitcase or somewhere they could get crushed),0
4.0,Great sounds and very comfortable,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"Works great and no lag when watching video.  Only complaint I have is when turning off the headphones I always end up in pairing mode then hold the button again to turn it off...The sound is great and microphone is clear from the people I've asked during calls...Battery life has been great, I've used these at work and after four hours battery showed 70% so I have no don't get would last a full work day plus commute.",0
4.0,"Decent audio for the price, good quality material","February 24, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these headphones a month ago and used them multiple times. I originally wanted a headphone replacement for a pair of beats that recently broke on me. I was disappointed with the quality at first because there wasn't a lot of bass, but I adapted and now I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. For the price you get decent quality audio (minus the lack of bass) and decent quality material.. for $35 you can't beat it.",0
5.0,Bought these on a whim after ordering Beats Studio over ear headphones from Best Buy for $179 on sale from $379,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"I hope they last. Bought these on a whim after ordering Beats Studio over ear headphones from Best Buy for $179 on sale from $379.  Upon comparison immediately re-boxed the Beats and returned.  The Mpows connected immediately with my phone, sound wonderful and are very comfortable.",2
5.0,Amazing customer service!,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"The customer service of this company really blew me out of the water! I'm over all very impressed. These headphones seem to bass heavy and the Mpow H1 headphones provide a crisper sound still with bass. Both are great headphones, its a matter of preference when it comes to the sound you prefer. It's convenient that they have those two options which are very closely priced.",0
5.0,Great Product,"September 16, 2017",Yes,We bought two pair and love them!!!!! I wear them cutting the grass and they muffle the noise of the mower and are able to turn up super loud! The battery life last a long time. I used them on two 7 hour flights and they still had juice. You can also change the song your listening to or answer the phone with buttons on the headset. This keeps you from dragging the phone out of your pocket when on the lawn mower. I would recommend.,0
5.0,Five Stars,"April 28, 2018",Yes,Pairing was easy and able to answer my iPhone with them on and people can hear me,2
5.0,All around quality for the price.,"August 30, 2018",Yes,"This is my 3rd set of Bluetooth headphones and they far surpass any of the others. They sound fantastic, they are the most comfortable and well made, better than I ever expected. They are all around better than ones that cost 3 times as much. I will never even try another. Highly recommend.",0
5.0,Great headphones,"July 5, 2017",Yes,I love these. I had a new cartilage piercing that interfered with wearing my normal ear buds comfortably. These solve that and sound amazing. They also pair easily with all of my devices. Great over-ear bluetooth headphones for the price.,2
5.0,Impressive customer service,"January 14, 2018",Yes,the bluetooth function died after a week. only headphone works. if there was a zero would give it..Update.  This company replaced my headphone free of charge or hassle. The new one works well very pleased,1

5.0,Fantastic headphones for the price.,"January 5, 2018",Yes,"I expected these headphones to be good, but I didn't expect them to be AS good as they are. Fantastic sound, connection, fit, and they even come with a sweet little bag for carrying. While these may not be the ""top of the line"" headphones, they are definitely good enough for day to day use for video makers and light audiophiles.",0
5.0,... are not expensive and I have surprised by how easy it was to pair and how well they sound,"October 29, 2017",Yes,"just got these headphone s to check them out since they are not expensive and I have surprised by how easy it was to pair and how well they sound.  they sound as good as the beats headphones my niece and nephew have at a faction of the cost.  totally worth hit.  very happy with them.  I still prefer my shure earbuds but for witerless headphones, these are great",0
5.0,I was worried at first that these wouldn't be any good because I've purchased other bluetooth products and their quality ...,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"So these headphones are definitely noise cancelling.When I was trying them, my family had the tv on very high and when I put these on, I couldn't hear the tv at all.. I was worried at first that these wouldn't be any good because I've purchased other bluetooth products and their quality was just not what I was looking for. However, these headphones are incredible! They connect very easily with bluetooth and even tell you when the phone is connected..The few things I had issues with at first was the volume of the headphones, I thought the headphones were low volume but then I discovered you can turn the volume of the headphones up on the headphones, independent of the music device..Since then, I've been very happy with the sound and volume quality on these. Overall, great buy.",0
5.0,An Excellent Set of Headphones,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"The headphones sound great, fit snug (but yet comfortable), and they have a very long battery life.

These are a nice value for the price.",0
5.0,"These are totally comfortable, the battery lasts forever","March 31, 2018",Yes,"These are totally comfortable, the battery lasts forever, and it connects all my Bluetooth devices perfectly.

3.0,Really great device. I didn't give 5 stars because it ...,"December 5, 2017",Yes,"Really great device.  I didn't give 5 stars because it hurts my ear a little due to the dimensions of the ear muffs.  Sound quality is great!...Update: So my headphone has failed to turn on, I tried charging it and its not even charging. The bluetooth doesn't work. It only works with the aux cable. Soooooooo disappointed. Haven't had it for 8 months.",0
5.0,Great  quality headset for the price!!!,"April 9, 2018",Yes,"This purchase is one of the best that I've made as far as headphones are concerned. They are very comfortable,  and the sound is of good quality. I was a little worried about the durability, but once I unpacked them, I was very impressed with the quality of these headphones.  I use them daily, most of the time when I'm working, so durability is key for me. Overall, I am pleased, and the cost is amazing, so that just makes it all the more better. Choose these, and you won't be dissapointed.",0
4.0,Ok for the price. Needs noise cancellation improvement.,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"Ok for the price. I was skeptical at first, but they kind of work and it’s cheap. They can work more on the noise cancellation. I have to turn the volume up higher just to make it work..Update.Customer service has contacted me in regards to the headphone was kind enough to send me a replacement. It definitely made a difference in sound quality. Good job!",0

5.0,"Excellent sound, comfortable and extremely affordable.","February 19, 2018",Yes,"So far, so good.  They sound great, pair easily. seem solidly constructed and are pretty comfortable.  Phone calls are not a problem and most outside is blocked.  The price was right. I almost went with a $300 pair of headphones so price wasn't really an issue I just wanted clear, durable, comfortable headphones and it looks like mission accomplished.",0
4.0,Great,"January 7, 2018",Yes,"I've had these for a few months now, and the battery life continues to amaze me. I've charged them twice since I got them three months ago with twice daily use. They're stylish and convenient for my morning/evening commute. My only complaint would be that they are a little tight on my head and can give me a headache if I wear them for an extended period of time. But otherwise, they're pretty great.",0
5.0,By far one of the best headphones I've had,"July 3, 2018",Yes,By far one of the best headphones I've had.  It connects to bluetooth easily and the sound quality is quite good for the price you pay.  I love that it's cordless but also has the ability to be wired if needed. It cancels outside noise pretty well. I use it for work to drown out noise around me when I'm on conference calls.,0
3.0,Connects easily. The range is actually pretty fantastic,"February 17, 2018",Yes,"Not what I was expecting. Works well. Connects easily. The range is actually pretty fantastic. I was expecting more bass though. It's there just, not like a pair of SoundBot I had. Also, the top band seems to hurt my head after a while. Makes me wonder if there is something toxic in the manufacturing of the headband itself (I am a guy with very short hair btw). Thought about returning them just by that alone but, I haven't.",0
4.0,Good headphones for the price,"October 28, 2017",Yes,"For the price you can't go wrong. The range is remarkable (I can leave my phone on my lab bench and only lose connection if I go into another room putting a wall between the headphones and the phone.) The sound quality isn't the best, but it's passable for music and very good for podcasts. While the headphones don't feel heavy, I have noticed that the first few days wearing them (about 6 or so hours per day total) has left my neck a little sore. I'm guessing the muscle soreness will diminish with continued use. The battery life is great, I haven't had to charge during the day (they are on for at least 8 hours per day). If you're looking for a pair of economically priced pair of Bluetooth headphones, these are the ones.",0
5.0,"The headphones are nice, pair well","January 16, 2018",Yes,"The headphones are nice, pair well, feel comfortable. After a month, they started to sound like they were underwater. I wrote a review about it and what did Mpow do!? They emailed me asking what my issues were and tried to suggest a way to solve my issues. When they felt the emails to solve my issues were not enough, the sent me a FREE pair of the Mpow silver headphones through the email as compensation for my time and for me to get a second chance at their product. If that's not great customer care behind a good product, nothing is...I recommend not only buying this but letting others know how you feel about them!",0
3.0,"Bad sound, good look. No idea how comfortable they were because I didn't want to listen to music for too long with them.","January 12, 2018",Yes,"Bought these based on the enormous amounts of reviews and high rating. Look is as advertised, fairly comfortable for the 15 minutes I wore them. Fairly easy to pair and get going...Pros:.-Look.-Ease of use.-Folding..Cons:.-Sound quality is poor and distorted.-Barely any bass or low frequencies (huge negative)..I ended up returning. I couldn't enjoy music on these.",0
5.0,excellent!,"October 27, 2017",Yes,"After a few months of owning these headphones, I have to say: These are simply the best headphones I have owned. Highly recommended!..pros:.pretty cheap.long battery life, i honestly forget to charge them and every time i go to use them the battery has charge..good Bluetooth range, I leave my phone around the house with music playing, and don't lose connection, and they do accept calls, apparently the microphone is good..lightweight, they don't weigh a lot, nor are bulky, so you don't feel them after a while...cons.the headphones could extend a bit longer, I have to wear them fully extended.",0
5.0,Comfy,"August 21, 2018",Yes,"These are very comfortable and although they are not noise cancelling they do a pretty good job of blocking outsi de noise.  Haven’t used them for music yet, just podcasts.  The sound quality seems good.  They are cushy enough t allow me to rest on my side when listening in bed.",0
5.0,Great Quality! Great Price,"June 22, 2018",Yes,"I got these because I have a new Daith piercing and can no longer wear earbuds. I've never used headphones, so I wasnt sure what to expect, but the sound quality is just as amazing as any earbud that ive tried, and they fold up so theyre easy to travel with!",1
4.0,Noise cancelling for you...maybe not for others,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"The headphones work wonderfully and I love that they can either be plugged in or blue toothed. I wish they weren't so loud though, you can definitely hear what someone is listening to if the volume is up (even just a little). Keep that in mind if you plan to use these in a quiet environment. I'd still recommend, considering the price.",0
5.0,Fine Bluetooth Headphones for great battery life.,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"Very good Bluetooth headphones! The charge on them lasts two weeks if playing music an hour a day!.This set of HI-FI stereo headphones gives better results on Bluetooth than the included audio cable...Con:.The bass on the headphones is really heavy, but can be adjusted with an equalizer.",0
5.0,They are easy to use. They sound fine. No wires. Yea!!!!,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"Most people who review products like this are technophiles who love to comment on the technical specs. I'm not one of them I'm just an old man who likes to listen to Opera, Broadway, Choral, and Orchestral music while I walk/jog. I got real tired of getting tangled up in the wires of my old headphone. I love these wireless ones. The quality is fine with me. I get to listen without the aggravation of wires. Thanks to my sweet wife for loading hours and hours of great music on my phone.",0
4.0,Great for the price,"October 17, 2018",Yes,"Like most people I suppose, I did not want to pay a ton of money for quality blue tooth headphones. I saw these and thought I would give them a try. Turns out my coworker bought the same ones not too long before me. We both like them. I usually listen at work via blue tooth. Overall the sound quality is good, they are fairly comfortable as well. They actually fit over the ears instead of squishing them. Additionally, I don't have to have the sound up too loud to block out office noise. So far I am pleased with them, will see how time treats them though.",0
5.0,You will not be disappointed -- a fantastic deal for fantastic headphones.,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"These are fantastic sounding headphones. The build is quite sturdy. The battery lasts an entire week of my 1 hour commute each way on the BART in San Francisco -- that's at least 10 hours without needing a charge. The bass is rich and booming and the high-end is crisp and clear. Podcasts sound excellent too. For $35 these headphones are an incredible deal. And I won't get upset if I break or lose them, versus paying nearly $300 for Beats.",0
5.0,Great sound for a great price!,"March 20, 2018",Yes,These are awesome! I was hesitant on buying Bluetooth wireless headphones without seeing them first but these work great! Great sound easy to use and would definitely recommend! I had to get rid of the wired earbuds so I didn’t get caught in everything and these headphones are just what I needed! Thank you,0
4.0,These headphones die!,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"These headphones worked well for three or four months.  Then they developed connection difficulties and would connect and disconnect on their own.  I worked with them as best as I could switching to the cable at times. Now they are completely gone.  They will not hold a charge at all.  If you are okay with headphones that will only last a few months, these are relatively inexpensive and may work for you.  But you will have to replace them after a few months...*Update:  I changed the rating I gave from two stars to four.  The seller contacted me and offered to send a replacement.  They were very concerned and wanted to be certain I had a good experience with the headphones.  These replacement headphones work very well.  The customer service with this seller is excellent.",0
4.0,Baby Pink Bluetooth Headphones,"June 30, 2018",Yes,"These are really awesome Bluetooth over the ear headphones. I would have given four an a half stars due to the quality of the music or what's played through the headphones..Cute color, it's like a baby pink (alike to picture) and they fit over my ears which have not bothered me using them at the gym or even cleaning around the house.",0
5.0,Love them,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"I love the color. The volume control has a very high range. I’ve needed to charge it once and that didn’t take more than a couple hours. The only downfall is you can only sync it to one item at a time, but I’m not fancy enough to need that function.",0
4.0,Not too shabby,"August 27, 2017",Yes,"For the price, they are better than I expected...The highs are good...The bass isn't that great (it sounds good with some songs and sounds distorted with others), but for the price, you can't really expect the bass to be as good as more expensive headphones...Fitment is good.  For those saying that their ears don't fit inside of them (over the ear) and they fit more like on the ear, you must have some HUGE ears!!  I'm 6'2"" 250lbs and my ears fit in them just fine...The noise cancelling is pretty good.  I have a $200 pair of headphones that I love (I just bought these to get sweaty while doing cardio) and the noise cancellation is about the same...Bluetooth connection was super easy.  It took about 10 seconds to connect. No issues at all...Overall,  I'd buy these again without hesitation and would recommend them to anyone looking for an inexpensive decent set of headphones.",4
5.0,Great Bargain Headphones,"December 15, 2017",Yes,"I like the sound. I use them with my iPhone, LG6, iPad, Mac Pro, Xbox one, etc. I haven’t had a problem with them. I like the volume button on the side. The battery lasts over a week or two from train rides listening to Spotify. It does let in a little noise, but for the price, it’s defintely a bargain. I bought a set for me and my wife.",0
5.0,These headphones are really great! I bought a Bluetooth dongle for my desktop ...,"April 13, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are really great! I bought a Bluetooth dongle for my desktop PC as it doesn’t have Bluetooth (lol obviously) and I can walk from one end of my house to the other and never lose signal, I guess that part has more to do with the dongle, anyway, they sound amazing, I’m so impressed at the sound and bass and also the ease of use, I recommend them.",0
4.0,The fit really nicely and I used them to workout and they stayed ...,"December 3, 2017",Yes,Definitely not noise canceling but that's not in the description anyways. These are really decent Bluetooth headphones. They do leak a lot of sound when they are loud but I expected that anyway. The fit really nicely and I used them to workout and they stayed in place the entire time. They hold charge for a while which is really nice.,0
5.0,This headset sounds amazing and holds a charge a very long time,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"This headset sounds amazing and holds a charge a very long time. If you order them and they sound muffled on your computer and you are running windows 10 CHECK YOUTUBE for the fix. Its a windows 10 thing, its not the headphones. I use these for gaming and chatting on discord with no problems. Love the headset!!!",0
4.0,This was a great purchase for our son’s birthday present,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"This was a great purchase for our son’s birthday present. He loves the quality of the sound and the versatility of the Bluetooth usage. They fit well and seem to be very durable and well made. The color red was a true red. Would have given the 5 stars but the aux cord that came with it was very poor quality and had broken at the end, having to disgard of it. I’m hoping that they will replace it. Other than that, it was a good purchase.",0
5.0,"Lovely headphones, wonderful price","May 1, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are amazing! I've been looking for a nice pair, one that I wouldn't have to spend a fortune on. I've heard not so spectacular things about Beats headphones (which is what I was originally looking at). But these are perfect! The cushions are perfect and don't put pressure on my ears like another pair I had. Definitely would recommend these. Music and videos sound great through their speakers.",0
5.0,"These fill the bill pretty well, although if I max the sound there ...","October 27, 2017",Yes,"I wanted headphones that I could listen to without bothering my workmates.  These fill the bill pretty well, although if I max the sound there is a lot of sound bleed.  At a comfortable level there is very little sound bleed, and they block incoming sounds as well.  The bluetooth setup is incredibly fast, and they reconnect very quickly as well.  Sound quality is also good...My body overall runs hot, so I pop them off every hour or so for a few minutes and then I'm good to go...They are also solidly built.  They are mostly plastic, but there is metal on the pieces that move.",0
3.0,Try Mpow BH142A better,"September 27, 2018",Yes,"I bought initially a Mpow 059 Model: BH059A. S/N: X001O27CMN and just before a 2 months, the product power in or battery itself did not charged anymore. I also have a lot of hard time using the earphones as they are heavy and uncomfortable to your ears.. After writing this review, the manufacturer contacted me apologized and send over its Model BH142A, a most ergonomic, well built headphones that I have been tested for a week and have observed an amazing lasting battery life and clear and acoustic sound. I think the manufacturer post-sale service was proper and so the way they replaced my broken headset. The new model is far better.",0
4.0,"Great cordless, Bluetooth enabled headphones!!","January 13, 2018",Yes,"They work great!!! I have listened to about 9-10 hours of an audiobook and I haven't had to charge them since I received them!! I am impressed with these headphones!! They are easy to turn on, sync to Bluetooth enabled devices, and turn off. Highly recommend unless you are looking for noise cancelling. In that case, these are not for you. Otherwise great for the price!!",0
4.0,"Sound quality is awesome, but tight on big heads. (Like mine)","February 23, 2018",Yes,"Really really tight on my head. Nice sound quality, but gives my Jaw some pain after awhile of wearing...EDIT: Patozon support contact me and sent me a different headset they make, and it fits my big head much better..If you think you might have a similar issue, take a look at the Mpow H1. http://a.co/2T1eo78",0
2.0,"The foam was very soft and felt comfortable, so if you looking for just headphones this ...","April 2, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my husband to use at work. He’s on and off phone calls all day and doesn’t want any outside noise to distract him. We had to return them because the microphone didn’t work well at all. The foam was very soft and felt comfortable, so if you looking for just headphones this might work. But if your expecting phones calls, forget it.",0
5.0,Battery not charging.,"July 16, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these headphones in April 2017. I use them primarily for the gym. At first, I had no complaints, the bluetooth range is about 30 ft. The battery lasts at least 3-4 times at the gym before needing charging at 1 1/2 -  2 hours each session. Until now, the battery will not charge completely. It will only charge halfway. Very disappointed in this product. Hopefully, they will replace them and this is just a one off. If they are replaced, I will update.",2
5.0,Awesome design and value. I have only positive experience so far,"February 11, 2018",Yes,"I like everything about this product. They are comfortable, easy to pair, sound great and look great. They really do sound great. Battery lasts way longer than expected. I'm just very happy with this purchase and it didn't break the bank.  They are loud enough to hear over my riding mover and snowblower as well! Awesome design and value.",0
3.0,Decent Headphones,"May 4, 2018",Yes,"Not horrible, but not great. These headphones do their job, but they're bigger than I wanted and they can kind of hurt your ears after wearing them for a while.  Bluetooth doesn't work on the airplane so I ended up using the cord attachment. I probably will not use them as much as intended.",0
5.0,It's as good as anything from Bose,"April 24, 2017",Yes,This is an incredibly well made product - especially for the price. I'd put it up against offerings from beats. It's as good as anything from Bose. You need to be real audiophile to spot the difference...If you are just looking for an affordable way to listen to your music - this is it...Note: This is not a noise canceling headphone! So don't compare it with a 300$ noise canceling headphone.,0
3.0,Had to return the first headset because it would automatically ...,"February 22, 2018",Yes,Had to return the first headset because it would automatically un-pair if I paused a video. Also it stopped charging just a week after purchasing it...Ended up buying a replacement set and so far they work very well...Just keep in mind that if you get a headset they make be broken before you buy them.,0
5.0,It actually works!,"February 3, 2018",Yes,"Perfect fit on me, everything works great! Mic I was worried about but my friends can hear me just fine! Now people in the reviews, say that these don't work well after two weeks or months? I'll see how this goes once it's been around that time. It's 2/3/2018 when I got these...My only complaint is not the product but the tracker. It said delivered yesterday at 10pm, nothing was there yesterday. At least I got it today and it's perfect working condition.",0
5.0,Great for TV use,"December 7, 2017",Yes,I bought these to pair with my TV and they work great.  I bought an adaptor for the TV and the two pair easily.  They are comfortable and the sound levels are good even on low settings.  The sound quality is excellent and I am hearing sound effects that I don’t hear just using the TV.  My house is 1800 sq ft and the headphones work in every part of the house.,0
4.0,Pretty sweet deal,"October 11, 2017",Yes,"I bought these because my wife liked the color.  I bought a pair of Paww's for me at double the cost and I will tell you...these are just as good so don't get suckered into the buying of the packaging.  In fact...these fit better than the Paww's and sound quality...well, I didn't notice a difference.  But the Paww's synced to my IPad's bluetooth easier.",0
5.0,QUALITY HEADPHONES!!!!,"November 15, 2018",Yes,Best headphones I've owned by far. Sound is loud and crisp! Comfy even after lengthy wearing times. They get about 35 feet of range. These easily replaced my Beats headphones!!!! Takes my gym sessions and my morning jogs to the next level!!!,1
5.0,Loving the headphones,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"This my 2nd pair of headphones (different brands) and Mpow are much more comfortable, better sound quality and they fit snug to my head (unlike the previous pair).  I also find the features are much easier to use. I ride a vanpool to and from work and these are great as no one around me can hear them (unlike the other pair), no matter the volume level.",0
5.0,Beats on a Budget!!,"March 11, 2018",Yes,"My husband did tons of research before purchasing a pair for both of us. Theses headphones are by far some of the best we have ever paid for. The battery life is good and the sound quality is amazing. They fit comfortably for long periods of time, especially with wearing eyeglasses. The Bluetooth range is great! I can go into the basement to do laundry and leave my phone or mp3 on the 1st or 2nd floor with no distortion to sound. I would say the only downside we could find is that the charging cord is very short, but we just used old usb cell phone chargers we had nd problem solved. If you don't want to spend tons $ on Beats headphones but want quality, these are worth it!",0
1.0,PASS.,"September 17, 2017",Yes,I regret to say these headphones do not operate properly with my amazon Fire TV. They were relatively easy to pair but seem to have a short in them because the sound stops for a minute then resumes at a lower volumne. When using them with the TV the sound is muted on the TV so others in the room cannot hear it at all. The sound quality through the headset depends on what I am watching and is not uniform in thst I have to continuously adjust the volume with the Fire remote control.  It is too late to return them and I can't afford to buy more. THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL IS VERY TINY AND UNCLEAR.,7
5.0,... look for over ear headphones that would be more comfortable and these are working great for me,"April 23, 2018",Yes,"The earplugs and headphone I already had have been hurting my ears so I decided to look for over ear headphones that would be more comfortable and these are working great for me. I have them paired to my smartphone and my Kindle Fire 10 and use them several hours a day, sometimes for three hours straight.",0
5.0,"Great headphones, great price!","October 27, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones! The sound is crisp and clear. Good bass. Bluetooth was super easy to set up. There's even a little ""battery power remaining"" icon on my phone. That's pretty sweet. Haven't received a phone call yet, but it should work. If not, I'll change this review...The wireless feature is nice. I've never owned wireless headphones before so I'm stoked!",0
5.0,I enjoy this product,"April 28, 2018",Yes,I enjoy this product .Had no problems getting it to work with my I phone 8. A little tight on my x large melon. For the price its great,2
4.0,Good bang for the buck.,"March 17, 2018",Yes,"Nice headphones, love the ear pads nice and comfortable, good sound for the buck, only draw back is the button that you on the ear piece should be better marked, can barely make out the arrows, could be slightly darker and or have raised dots for touch so you can feel the area to press, other than that nice.",0
2.0,Not ideal for exercise!,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"Had them for a month or so and they just haven’t been cutting it for me when I try to use them during exercise. Even with my big old head they don’t squeeze enough to stay secure during any activity with movement. the pads get very hot during exercise and too slippery when wet with sweat to stay secure on your head. I spend my entire workout adjusting and readjusting them. (Not just running, they come loose during pull ups, deadlifts, rowing, just about everything I’m doing.)",0
5.0,Inexpensive / Solid Service / Comfortable,"April 26, 2018",Yes,Fair to good sound. This is a comfortable and reliable headset. No noise cancellation but reduces noise in my noisy office. And they hold the charge. Good price.,1
3.0,Sound Quality,"October 2, 2018",Yes,"still need to work more on bass (2.5/5)  .... the earbuds  are greatly isolated to outside environment (4/5).high latency when using bluetooth (20-30ms) recommend using with the Aux... long battery duration (3.5/5). not recomomend using while both aux  cable and charging cable as it could cause audio distortion.....built in- button funtions works great although , I sometimes misclick the call button when music is not running, it will automatically call someone randomly ( pls fix that)....Would rate 4/5 if the bass are more consistent....... Overall a great headphone choice for (low- budget) ones (3.7/5).",0
5.0,Great experience,"August 19, 2018",Yes,These headphones are great. I am not a sound junkie so they work just fine for me. They are quite comfortable and the sound is good (in my opinion). The battery lasts a long time too. They're a bit bulky to wear in bed but for everything else they're just fine.,0
5.0,Awesome headphones! I love these!,"April 18, 2018",Yes,I purchased these based on a co-worker's opinion. He recommended I get them and I do not regret it. These are awesome for the price! They have excellent sound quality and they sound even better if you use an app that has an equalizer. They have plenty of bass. I even had to change my equalizer settings to turn the bass down because these sound so good.,0
2.0,Love the color scheme,"December 14, 2017",Yes,"Love the color scheme, build quality is nice...sound is nothing to write home about. I have a lot of high end headphones and just wanted these to work out with in case I damaged them or ruined them etc. Sound is just off...a bit muddy and tinny sounding on the high end. Comfort is nice, prefer my aukey buds though sound wise.",0
5.0,Excelente!!!,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"The first one that they sent me, it seems that it had defects, because it was not listened well and now it is no longer connected with the computer and telephone. The company responsible for the sale contacted me and offered me a new one..This one listens very well, it's excellent quality. Thanks for your seriousness and respect to the client.",0
5.0,Great battery and sound for the money,"April 23, 2018",Yes,I bought these to replace a set of wired over hear headphones. I primarily use them on a plane to block out noise and they worked great. The battery lasted me for a transatlantic flight and then some. The sound quality and volume were great. I have used the as wired headphones as well and they worked nicely there too. I would say these are a great buy for the money.,0
1.0,Comfort yes sound Quality Big No,"December 18, 2017",Yes,For 45 bucks thought I would get something decsent far as sound quality the bass and tremble sounds flat the vocals sounded TERRIBLE ....switched over to netflix to hear the sound from a action movie ...best way to describe the sound was like listing to a bootleg movie that sombody had recoreded in a theater Def will be returning these after one day of use. Only reason for 1 star is comfort. If you like light sounding music R&amp;B Classical mabe country this maybe for you,1
2.0,Looks good and sound quality is pretty good but sound keeps ...,"June 13, 2018",Yes,"Looks good and sound quality is pretty good but sound keeps cutting out and you need to turn it off and back on to regain connection. Also, it's too tight and become very uncomfortable to wear after 20 minutes. I tried stretching them out which made it looser but it was still bad.",0
5.0,Love love love these comfortable headphones,"March 8, 2018",Yes,Love love love these comfortable headphones! Thus far these things have proved their worth. My favorite thing ab them is that they literally last for days as I am still yet to have them go dead on me before I think about charging them. Love that I can be listening to music and answer a call on my cell phone without having to take them off or stop what Im doing. Great value for the small price of these comfortable nice looking headphones!,0
5.0,great headphones,"January 3, 2018",Yes,These headphones sound pretty good after some hours of burn in time.  the bass was distorted at first.  and the 150hz and 250hz freqs are too high.  I use poweramp and use the eq to make it sound better.  I expect after some time of use those freqs will even out.  I haven't tried it with the cable yet to see if there's a sound quality difference.,0
4.0,Good sound and well built.,"March 29, 2018",Yes,I liked these so well I bought another for our vacation home. I would have given them a 5 star but they are a little heavy on the head. I don't know what the long term results will be but out of the box they are fine and pair with my system nicely. Ear pieces are comfortable and large. For the price they are fine.,0
5.0,Great deal for the price,"January 30, 2018",Yes,"I bought these to use at work with my laptop--bluetooth enabled. Great deal for the price! Sound is great and mic works great. I was a little worried because it is just a little hole on the side, but, other participants on conference calls can hear me very clearly. Very comfortable fit and ear pads are very comfy. They fold up great for storage when not in use and charging is a breeze. Would recommend!!",0
5.0,"Nice and loud, microphone crystal clear.","September 2, 2017",Yes,"I was issued a replacement headphone model from my original purchase and these are GREAT.  I tested the mic by leaving myself a VM on my phone and it was very clear.  Playback of music is loud.  Bluetooth easily connects.  Not as comfortable on the ears as the original model, but I'd rather have my music loud.  This company really does reach out to make you happy with your purchase.",0
1.0,Cheap,"September 11, 2018",Yes,"First thought these were good headphones... but microphone has never worked on these, after a little bit of use it seems cheap, also a wierd thing is the headphones talk to you when you power them on and off, even when pairing, just wierd that when you try to turn them off you have to hear the pairing voice first then the powering off voice... kinda annoying and I wouldnt recommend these to anyone",0
5.0,Wow! Very impressed.,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"Purchased these for my son after his Beats broke.  He absolutely loves these headphones. Paired easy and fast. Voice is crystal clear during phone calls. Music is very loud but clear. Excellent highs, mids, and bass. Range is over 30 feet. Build feels premium and not flimsy. Great item for the price. Highly recommend. Thanks Amazon for such a great deal.",0
1.0,Headphones stopped working after 3-4 days of usage,"January 19, 2018",Yes,The headphone stopped working after 3-4 days of using it. It does not flash while pairing. The bluetooth infact is not switched on since no other devices can find it. I bought it simply because I wanted to listen to music wirelessly and this product does not do exactly what it is supposed to do. I have emailed the supplier and they did not return back my email.  Extremely unsatisfied with this product.,1
3.0,The good point is its Bluetooth works fine within a 3-bedroom ...,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"The Bluetooth does not work a bit away from the source. In case you are using some other Bluetooth devices, the phones will get interrupted by those. The sound quality is not really impressive. There is a little noise in the background that is irritating. It is kind of electrification zzzzz. I played the best quality audios and found it prevalent. So if you can spend a lot more money on high-quality headphones, go for them. Within this range of price, I think we have to tolerate these issues.",0
5.0,Very good audio quality,"December 14, 2017",Yes,"Headphones are as described by seller.  Very good audio quality, but they don't get super loud even when connected to home receiver.  Good bass, but not great, does not distort sound.  Bluetooth indoor range about 30 feet threw numerous walls.  Very good noise cancellation.  I am very satisfied with these headphones and would recommend them.  The seller is very fast and great customer service.",0
5.0,Good sound and inexpensive,"September 12, 2018",Yes,"I like the no-boom microphone, it is heard clearly, without shouting.  Use in MMORPGs using Teamspeak.  Charge lasts for a full night of online gameplay.  Headband is comfortable, connects easily with bluetooth dongle on PC.  I bought this because my wired headset kept getting tangled in the chair rollers, and finally the control button overheated and quit working.  I am happy with this new setup, will probably buy another for my other computer.",0
5.0,Good sounds quality for the price.,"March 30, 2018",Yes,"For the price, I wasn't expecting a lot. I just wanted a nice set of headphones to use at work to block out co-workers and use when I travel. I was very surprised and pleased. I have not used the blue tooth feature yet but being directly connected to my laptop and my ipod, the sound quality is great.  They are comfortable around the ears and they block out everything around you when you are listening to music. Even when they are off, they damper the noise to where you can faintly hear things around you.  I actually been on the fence about buying a 2nd pair, so I can just leave a set at work.  For $40, this was a good buy.",0
4.0,"Good sound, suboptimal fit","July 21, 2018",Yes,"The sound from these headphones is good, but I find myself getting a headache if I wear them over an hour. Too much pressure on the top of my head...Edit: The seller got in contact with me and sent me a different pair of MPow headphones as a replacement - great customer service!",0
5.0,The might work great for other people.,"August 4, 2017",Yes,"The work fairly well. when I get up and go into the kitchen 25 feet I'll lose the sound and the only way to restore the sound is to turn head phones off and back on, and then there is about a 5 second delay in picking up the sound. When turning the head phones on it takes sever seconds for them to turn on. And they do have a tendency to cause the ears to be uncomfortable.",0
5.0,Awesome headphones!!,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are fantastic! I've only had them for about a month, but I love them. I didn't even charge them when I got them and they lasted for over a week. I only plugged them in eventually so they wouldn't die in the middle of my using them. I love that you can plug them in too if you don't want to use the battery. This also helps when I'm at work and I need to plug them into my laptop so as not to disturb anyone. I'll definitely be buying a pair of these for my husband. They're very comfortable and the sound is great too.",0
5.0,"Once you get used to the weird one-button thing, they are a great set of headphones","April 18, 2018",Yes,"I've been using these while mowing the lawn for almost a year.  They're very comfortable, the battery life has been outstanding, and the sound is good (I'm no audiophile, I can't say if it's great or not)...The UI is kinda crap: aside from volume up and volume down, there's just one button, which controls pause/play, on/off, and pair/disconnect, all based on how long you hold the button down.  This was a terrible decision, but once you get used to it, it's fine.",0
5.0,They work like beats but half the price,"June 8, 2018",Yes,My husband got a pair for his bday after our beat headphones broke. Let’s just say a couple months later I needed a pair of my own. They work like beats but half the price ... and they’re wireless!!!! Perfect for running! The volume is perfect and they’re steardy! I highly recommend !!,1
4.0,"These are great for listening to music, as long as you're not using the mic too","December 15, 2017",Yes,"These headphones sound so good. They fit my big head and big ears perfectly. I use them on my PC and my phone. The media controls work great on my phone, but on my PC the pause/play button only pauses, it can't play. The audio quality significantly decreases when I enable the mic on my PC. They can't play audio from two devices at the same time, but it switches instantly if you pause one of the devices. Overall they're great and I plan on using them for a long time",1
5.0,Great Headphones,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"These are great headphones! They fit my ears perfectly and Last week I used them while I was doing yard work and they didn't slip off my head like my other ones do. And it's so nice not getting caught on the cord, however it is nice to have the option to use a cord if you don't want to run the battery down.",0
1.0,Quit after a few months,"September 2, 2018",Yes,They looked ok but the on off system is over complex. This is possibly what caused them to quit. They charge but will not operate flashing the on off lights  permanently. No instructions came with them as to how to operate them. I have bought better for less.,0
4.0,Love these things,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"Love these things..super comfortable, blocks out all sound, sound quality is more than adequate, battery seems to last a pretty long time,and only $40 .. sorry dr. Dre but these are good enough to keep my head ringing. Only thing I can say is maybe a little heavy but not sure how higher quality headphones compare.",0
5.0,Great value and quality for the price,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"This headset works great, battery life is good. Tried it in audio conferencing and could easily hear the conversation and be heard by others. I'm not very happy with the quality of bass sound when I listen to music but it's not a big deal and wouldn't change my 5 star rating.",0
4.0,Great headphones!,"November 23, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are great! I mainly use them for working out. I wish they had a little more base, but i am willing to compromise for the comfort they provide! They are extremely comfortable and easy to wear for long periods of time. They fold in half for easy-storage. They are also a little big/bulky, but again, if you dont care too much about what others think about you, great purchase! The battery is amazing! Super easy to connect using bluetooth.",0
5.0,Full charge lasts me like a week or more,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"Been using these for around 2 hours/day and battery holds up. Full charge lasts me like a week or more. Comfortable ear cushions and fully covers ears, which is what I was looking for. Foldable, but these are big so they don't change in size too much, but still fit easily in the pouch that it comes with. For the price, its great. Of course you could buy something like beats studio for $2-300 with better quality. This definitely is worth it if you don't want to spend a lot on a set of headphones.",0
5.0,Awesome,"April 29, 2018",Yes,I was super surprised by the sound quality of these headphones. I’ve bought more expensive products and regretted the purchase because the sound was horrible.,1
4.0,Issue resolved very quickly.,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"The headset looked good and had great sound, my issue was it would only keep a charge for about 2.5-3 hours. I contacted amazon and they sent me another pair two days later and these work great. would purchase again I just got a bad pair the first time.",0
4.0,Best with Wired Connection,"March 3, 2017",Yes,"The headphones are pretty good. The audio through Bluetooth isn't really that great, which is why some people were complaining that the bass wasn't as what they had expected it to be with Bluetooth. And I'll admit, I was a little disappointed that the bass wasn't that great via Bluetooth. HOWEVER, when they died (and the battery lasts a very long time) and I had to resort to the wired connection (AUX cable), I was amazed when I heard my music play through the headphones. The Audio is REALLY beautiful when you use the AUX cable. The bass is better when you play through wired connection. I just wish it was like that with the Bluetooth connection.",1
5.0,You can hear a quiet jazz trio while walking along a busy road,"December 22, 2017",Yes,"Awesome headphones, with very clear, pristine audio in all sorts of frequencies. Decent noise isolation, great bluetooth range, easy to use. My one and only gripe with them is the charger cable and port - the cable is comically short (at most 1.5'), and the port, smaller than a regular micro usb, is very very tight and seems at risk of breaking every time I connect it to charge. Still holding up after 2 months though! I'm considering buying a second pair based on how much I like these, and the price is great too (I've used a lot of decent headphones while recording/mixing in various studios, and the clarity on these things beats all but the really expensive, high end ones). Highly recommended!",0
5.0,Surprised and impressed!,"July 22, 2017",Yes,"I was both surprised and impressed with this purchase. I was surprised by the low price for starters. Then when I tried out the sound quality, I was pleased and impressed with the full spectrum of bass to mid and high range instruments like high hat cymbals etc.. Very happy with these headphones.",1
5.0,"Functional, Good Sound","April 15, 2018",Yes,"These are very solid so far. Love the controls for volume and change track on the ear. Comfortable, very good sound. Functional and a good price. I had two devices connected and went for a jog and was getting some feedback from the tablet at home so I disconnected it and it worked fine.",0
5.0,Comfy! Great headphones!,"October 11, 2018",Yes,These headphones are very comfortable. They connected to my Samsung Note immediately! The battery life is very long (not sure how long because it has never died on me. I've had these for 6 months. My son started borrowing them so much that I bought him a pair for his birthday. And as you can see I think he approves.,0
4.0,Good quality at a fair price,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"I didn't have any trouble connecting my headphones to my devices. So far they are working great! I charged them overnight and have been using them in short bursts so I can't say how long the battery life is, but so far they've lasted about 5 hours. For the price, they seem like good quality. The sound is good, they fit comfortably (I took a nap with them on), and I love the pop of green.  They do block quite a bit of outside noise so I've not had the volume up too high to know the quality of sound at all levels. Like others have said, the bass isn't prominent but most of my music doesn't require a bass boost so it doesn't bother me. After using these for a few days, I don't think I would ever spend more on other headphones. These are perfect for me.",0
5.0,VERY comfortable!,"March 18, 2018",Yes,We purchased two of these for a trip.  They are pretty comfortable.  I have very small ears and earbuds do not fit me at all.  The only problem I have is that they do not work very well with Dragon Naturally Speaking because they pick up too much back ground noise.  But other than that they are really nice.,0
1.0,Power button fell off,"October 10, 2017",Yes,This worked great until the power button popped out.  Now I am struggling to put it in the right holes to turn it on. Really disappointed because it worked so well up until this point.  I’ve had it a little over 2 months.,9
5.0,I couldn’t believe this,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"For this price I was worried I would get a total piece of junk but I am so happy these were a great deal, they are just as good as $150 Bluetooth ones sold elsewhere, there is even a mic built in you can talk on the phone while wearing them and people hear you fine, I’m happy with my purchase was totally worth it",0
5.0,These to me are far better than any of them,"October 2, 2017",Yes,"I have a pair of Bose, Senheiser and Ultimate Ears. These to me are far better than any of them. I bought these for working around the yard as I thought the others were a bit too spendy to be using for yard work. I am impressed with the fit, feel and the sound. Would like to compare them against a pair of Beats but I suspect they’re as good... espeicially at the price point.",0
1.0,I don't understand how it was rated this good when it was beyond horrible,"August 23, 2017",Yes,Do not get fooled by all these fake reviews. You can't use the microphone on your laptop. Headset is extremely tight on your head unless you are a toddler. I don't understand how it was rated this good when it was beyond horrible.,3
5.0,terrific!,"September 12, 2018",Yes,I absolutey love these headphones... they are comfortable and the sound quality is great... i love that they have no wire and i can listen to music or videos and walk through the house ..its great not having to be anchored by plug in headphones!,0
5.0,2 devices at once,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"These headphones' best feature is they can connect to two devices at the same time! So you and your friend can listen to the same music together. Or you can watch videos on your tablet and answer phone calls on your cell at the same time. The sound isn't as awesome as Beats Solo 3 or Bose, but for the price these cans can't be beat.",0
5.0,The design is nice-- exactly as pictured and sturdy by the feel of it,"April 1, 2018",Yes,"The design is nice-- exactly as pictured and sturdy by the feel of it. Pairs with no trouble and promptly. The only reason it did not get all five starts is because it's the first week and I want to wait it out a bit; furthermore, the treble isn't as clear compared to my earphones that came with my phone. As of this moment, these headphones work incredibly well. Will keep you posted, but for their price and brand, whatnot, they're good...Update: It has been half a year and these work just as good as the day I got them-- that's why the rating got bumped up to 5 stars.",0
5.0,My HONEST opinion,"October 17, 2018",Yes,"I could say that these headphones exceeded my expectations, I first I thought they were going to be crappy, due to the price that they are, now I really like them very much and I would definitely recommend them to anyone, now what I dislike about them, is that it takes too long to charge and I would of loved it if they were fast charging and a type C charging cable, maybe they will make them that way in the future, hopefully, but good job guys..I would definitely buy them again",0
2.0,Way to tight against the top of the head and the bottom of the ears,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"I really wanted to like these headphones!  I like the features of Bluetooth or wired and the multiple device connected, along with the price..Unfortunately, they are heavy and are too tight against the top of the jaw/bottom of the ear and on the top of the head.  All adjustments proved unable to make them comfortable..  In a short period of time trying them out, they gave me a headache.  I had to return them.",1
1.0,"Background audio worked great, but mic was terrible","August 30, 2018",Yes,"Background audio worked great, but mic was terrible. No one could hear me, and during game play, I could only hear the game background sound and I could not hear others talking except for brief seconds in and out, and they could not hear me at all.",0
4.0,"Good sound, long lasting battery","March 1, 2018",Yes,"Good sound, long lasting battery, easy to use controls.  Not the best for gym workouts as they tend to slide around a little, though they do stay on my  head when doing handstands.  Overall very happy with them.",1
4.0,Good Quality Sound and Construction,"September 30, 2017",Yes,"bottom line: these headphones are more than adequate and an incredible value at the current price ~$30..These headphones are of good build quality and produce above-average sound.  They are definitely comfortable (I have worn them for ~6 hrs at a time).  Pairing with a device is a breeze and so far, the charge lasts all day.  I like the option to use a wired connection as a backup...The only cons are: the glossy plastic picks up tons of fingerprints (especially on the black model) and the buttons feel a little cheap/are noisy when wearing the headphones.",0
4.0,Very good but for a couple issues.,"November 20, 2017",Yes,Overall satisfied with the build quality of these headphones. Very easy to connect the headphones via Bluetooth to my Yamaha amp..At times they start to lag which I correct by powering down and repowering them..My only complaint is that they are heavy and although the bottom of the head strap is padded they start to cause pain on the top of my head.,0
4.0,One Star,"December 20, 2017",Yes,Update: was sent new headphones by the company. Great customer service and working fine for what it’s worth. Past: Was great for several months and now won’t take a charge. It’s too late to return it :-(,1
5.0,SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"I bought these over-the-ear headphones, hoping they would be more comfortable than my existing on-ear headphones. Unfortunately, I was wrong. These headphones are SO uncomfortable that I couldn't even listen to a single CD without having to take them off. I thought that since the ear muffs surround the ear and don't press ON the ear, that this would be more comfortable than my other headphones, but, they are not. Also, the sound quality was quite poor. I turned off the bass on my boombox, but the sound still sounded rather muffled. Sadly, I will be going back to my old headphones that are on-ear, but do not surround the ear.  The only good thing I can say for these headphones, is that they DO provide some passive noise-canceling; but only for as long as you can tolerate having the headphones on...*** ADDENDUM TO REVIEW ***..I changed my rating from one-star to 5-stars because the company reached out to me and sent me a replacement pair of headphones at no charge.  I still think the MPOW 059 model is uncomfortable with poor sound quality; but the replacement Model MPOW H2 is much more comfortable and the sound quality is better.  In addition, if you use Bluetooth, the sound quality is great - even better than when using the audio cable.  This company's customer service is unsurpassed!",3
5.0,The sound is great. Blocks outside sound well also,"November 6, 2017",Yes,Definitely impressed. The sound is great. Blocks outside sound well also. Holds a charge for a long time. I haven't ran out of battery power yet and I listen to it all day while working. The only improvement I can think of is I wish the buttons on the side had a raised icon so you knew which button you were pressing by the feel of the button.,0
4.0,"First pair were broken, working product is a good buy.","October 4, 2017",Yes,"Headphones were faulty (cut out while walking), reviewer sent a new pair free of charge. New ones work fine. Gave old ones to my sister who doesn't use them while walking. Four stars for price and quick response from seller, -1 star for original product not working.",3
1.0,Wireless DOES NOT work,"July 12, 2018",Yes,"This is my review after 3 months.  When they arrived, everything worked.  But after that, these headphones can not keep a charge.  I have kept them connected to the outlet for 3 months, but its battery is completely dead.  So, the only way these will work connected via a cable.  I could of saved money, purchased something cheaper.  I have tried different electrical chargers and cables, yet they will not keep a charge.",5
5.0,Buy them now before somebody raises the price to what it should be.,"March 20, 2018",Yes,WOW! Amazing value for the price...Sound is much better that I expected...Battery life is the best of any Bluetooh device I own...Easy to figure out and easy to use...Came carefully packaged with everything I needed to use them immediately...5 Stars (or more),0
5.0,So comfortable I fell asleep wearing them.,"November 30, 2017",Yes,"I bought these to listen to meditations and binaural and solfeggio frequencies at night. I also chose these because they are wired... better frequency range and safer for my health. First headphones I was able to fall asleep wearing  and not wake up with ear pain. I really, really like these..Sound is clear and simple, just what I wanted.",0
3.0,These work great talking on phone via Bluetooth - updated,"July 18, 2018",Yes,"These work great talking on phone via Bluetooth. They are not as comfortable as I expected, though. Pairing to Bluetooth device versus powering off can be a little sensitive to touch. Overall a decent product..Update: Customer service sent me a replacement headset- H2 [Upgrade] Bluetooth Headphones w/ 4 Equalizer Modes. These headphones are very comfortable and work fantastic. They connect via bluetooth easier and the sound is great. I'm completely satisfied with the new headphones. Highly recommend. I would rate the replacement headset at 5 stars..I've never experienced unsolicitated customer service. To top it off, they sent me a better product.",0
4.0,Very pleased with this,"January 24, 2018",Yes,This was easy to use and easy to set up.  It is great for winter walks because it keeps my ears warm.  I will probably have to use something lighter when I walk in the summer.  I have not yet used the headphones to answer an incoming telephone but I like that feature.  The enclosed instructions are very clear.,0
2.0,Do Not Buy,"June 15, 2018",Yes,"Not only are these headphones big and uncomfortable, but even on low volume, you can hear the audio from outside the headphones CLEARLY. I’m glad I tested them out before getting on a plane and annoying the heck out of everyone around me! Also, the controls on the side are all flat- so you have no way to tell which button you are pressing unless you are looking in a mirror. Will be returning these",1
4.0,"Great sound quality, not very comfortable.","April 4, 2018",Yes,"These have great sound quality, but the band that sits on the top of my head starts hurting after about an hour even if I expand the headset to get the band off my head. It's like it pushes down on the top of my head. Not very comfortable, but I only wear them for an hour or two while doing homework so I can have quiet when my housemate is home.",0
1.0,"Cheap, broke after just a few uses.","May 10, 2018",Yes,Broke after just a few uses. Ear piece came disconnected from rest and wires broke. Cheap in price and quality. Spend more money to get better.,1
5.0,Very impressed,"January 21, 2018",Yes,"These are actually very good headphones. I don’t know how they’re selling these for this price. Ive got studio beats and these are more comfortable and for any average use, sound just as good. Very hard to believe that the price is so low. Connection and button controls are easy and straight forward. Worked with no issues from about 30 foot out through walls. I can leave my phone downstairs and listen clearly from upstairs.",0
5.0,cool purchase for the money,"November 2, 2017",Yes,"these are super nice, love the bluetooth AND the aux connection choices, has a decent sound, not super noise canceling but does great for the money i paid, use this when cutting grass and traveling",1
5.0,Pleasantly surprised!,"August 10, 2018",Yes,"As an owner of Bose headphones for 12 years, I was worried about buying something inexpensive. But after my Bose broke, I just couldn’t bring myself to spend the money on another pair. I found these and they had great reviews, but I honestly didn’t expect much. They have surprised me! The sound is great, I love that they are blue tooth, and wired.  They are super comfy (I sleep in them every night). They don’t feel as sturdy as my Bose, but Overall, I am extremely happy with them, and you can’t beat the price!",0
5.0,"got defective product, it was replaced a week later, works great","September 20, 2018",Yes,the sound quality is good. the battery lasts more than two full work days of constantly pausing/unpausing music to talk to the people around you. reaches farther than the beats earbuds one of my coworkers has,1
5.0,tried a random bluetooth headphones set and whenever I used ...,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"tried a random bluetooth headphones set and whenever I used it, videos would suddenly take 1000% longer to download. read a bunch of reviews that mantioned how well mpow worked. got these and they work well and are not a headache to connect, got it to synch with my dell laptop after two tries. seems a bit delicate around some joints, not for little kids or video game rage quitters",0
5.0,Great headphones!,"June 7, 2018",Yes,These are so comfortable and pair with everything I've ever asked them to so far. My husband wants a pair for himself now too!.Sound quality is great. They charge fairly quickly and not as often as I would have expected. (Battery seems to last a good long time.),0
4.0,"Good, (for the price).","September 11, 2017",Yes,"I've had these for a few weeks now, and used them almost nightly. Overall I'm pleased with my purchase, but mainly because of the affordable price tag. There is a background hiss that is audible but not distressing when they're not active. The Bluetooth connection falters slightly from time to time and the deeper tones have a slightly muffled quality but overall these have been very satisfactory for listening to audiobooks or music while I'm working.",0
1.0,"Sound quality was really bad, even for cheapo bluetooth headphones","September 5, 2017",Yes,"Sound quality was really bad, even for cheapo bluetooth headphones, and the battery was complete garbage and lasted less than an hour.",2
4.0,"Works great, good fidelity but confusing multipurpose center button.","May 18, 2018",Yes,"Pretty happy with these headphones. They work as intended, pretty good fidelity. The only gripe I have is the confusing center button that does like three things all based on number of presses and time. It takes a little getting used to but it's not a huge problem. If you're going to use this with a smartphone be aware of it's ability to call your last contact, could save you from a potentially embarrassing unintended phone call haha.",0
4.0,It's great for the price,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"It's great for the price, audio quality is pretty good, but when using it as a headset, the other side reports a lot of static and echo...good thing I primarily bought it to listen to audio...wish it had a little more bass though....",0
4.0,It is a little bit too big and a little bit too bulky for my liking especially because it's for my 5 year old son but the sound quality is AMAZING! I synced it to his iPad to make ...,"December 22, 2017",Yes,"Huge and bulky headphones but they work! I was a little hesitant purchasing this product at first but I figured, ""what the heck!"" and took the risk. It is a little bit too big and a little bit too bulky for my liking especially because it's for my 5 year old son but the sound quality is AMAZING! I synced it to his iPad to make sure it syncs (unlike my Beats) and lo and behold, it did and it is super loud. Not what I was expecting but pleasantly surprised and satisfied. I put the volume on Max on the headphones and the iPad to make sure it is noise blocking, and I couldn't even hear myself think. Will definitely have to monitor how loud he uses his headphones but for the quality &amp; price, I can't find better and I definitely wont go looking.",0
5.0,Great bang for the buck.,"March 31, 2018",Yes,These are some great headphones. I like them quite a bit. I've never tried any of the very expensive types so I guess I don't know what I am missing. I mostly use these to drown out other noises around the house and listen to classical at a low volume when I need to focus on something.,0
5.0,Good quality for price,"July 5, 2018",Yes,"I wear my headphones while I work, during exercise, and while gardening. The only odd thing I have noticed is that the headphones get static and stop playing when a microwave is operating near by. I also wish the battery life was longer. But overall I would recommend these headphones",0
4.0,These look awesome and work pretty good!,"October 8, 2017",Yes,"Stylish and has good volume. Unless your a blast your head off kind of person. I like that it talks to you. Only thing is I've had times were its cuting  in and out like how a CD skips. Not often, but its a little annoying and I was in range of my phone. Ive heard most wireless headsets do that, but overall there great I love them",0
5.0,"Great headphones, kinda short cable (easily remedied)","September 17, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great! The battery life for Bluetooth mode has been very good,  I have yet to drain them completely before being able to charge them. They also work well plugged in directly. I did replace the included audio cable with a longer one for convenience.",0
5.0,Great headphones.,"June 17, 2018",Yes,"Great headphones!  Best bang for buck and the can compete with head phones that are in the $150 range. Ended up buying another pair from my wife...Yes there are better, but not at this price.  You will be paying $200 plus and it s not worth it to me, these are great!",0
2.0,Sound cuts out fairly often. Device needs to be ...,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"Sound cuts out fairly often.  Device needs to be removed/installed in Windows each time the computer is rebooted.  Needs to be paired again when turning on.  Sound is awful when using the microphone in Windows 10 (more likely a windows/bluetooth problem than the headset itself).  Unfortunately, the return window has come and gone...",1
5.0,Great quality,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"We have two pairs m: one silver and one red. So far so good! Seem to hold a charge for a long time and stay in your head while working out. I do burpees and jumps, and haven’t had any problems. Sound quality is great.",1
4.0,Decent sound for a bargain price.,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"I consider myself a semi-audiophile and when I 1st put these bad boys in I was not impressed. However, after much thought I figured I was being too hard/expecting too much on a pair headphones for $30...So, for $30 these headphones do the job. They are also comfortable on my ears. I've done music seshes as long as 3-4 hrs and not a single problem...Only issue I have is the way you turn the headphones on/off &amp; pairing all using the same button is annoying for me. Wish the headphones had its own pairing button and its on on/off button.",0
5.0,Best Budget Bluetooth Headphones,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"I think these headphones are amazing, given the price point. The battery life is great, and the Bluetooth works very smoothly across all of my devices. If you aren't a fan of using Bluetooth (some devices can be fidgety), this product comes with the option of a wired connection as well, which I think is great. The ear cushions are padded nicely and I find them to be very comfortable to wear for long periods of time- they never bother me despite wearing glasses and multiple ear piercings. I would 100% recommend these if you are looking for something in this price range.",0
4.0,"Great for the price, but does cut out.","December 2, 2018",Yes,"Headphones are comfortable, sound great &amp; look stylish. They are also fairly easy to set up but sometimes they do cut out briefly which gets annoying even though they are at full power and two feet away from my laptop. But for the price, I would recommend them.",0
4.0,Mic does not work;Voice is feeble!!!,"December 7, 2017",Yes,"Update on January 10th:..Mpow sent a replacement which works beautifully!!  I like the voice quality  and folks on the other side are able to hear me loud and clear!!..Original Review:..The Mic does not work. Folks are indicating voice is feeble and not able to hear me at all!!!  I have tried reboot,install on multiple computers and smartphone (S8+).",1
5.0,I still can't believe they cost less than $40!!,"August 12, 2017",Yes,"I did not, admittedly, have the highest expectations when I ordered these, as I had previously paid over $300 for an extremely disappointing set of bluetooth Beats by Dre--that wouldn't even stay connected to any device that was streaming music, so how good can a sub-$40 set of headphones be?..That being said, these Mpow headphones are a steal!  They definitely outshine my former set of Beats in terms of reliability and price, and yet there hasn't been any noticeable difference in sound quality, in my opinion, between the two...5 stars!",1
4.0,Sound great,"May 14, 2017",Yes,"Once I figured out how to turn it on and pair, it sounds great.  Cuts out most of the gym noise of slamming weights and grunting meat heads  :)",3
3.0,While they pair up well with most devices easily and sound good,"December 19, 2017",Yes,"While they pair up well with most devices easily and sound good, you cannot pair two of these headphones to the same device. My wife and I thought it would be nice to watch movies together while wearing these headphones. After hours of fussing with computers, connections, devices etc. I could not make it work.  I contacted the manufacturer. Sure enough, I was told ""One headphone to one device at a time."" Well, that's kind of a bummer. So just to be clear, if you are solo (in your listening) and are wanting a great pair of headphones...these are pretty dang good. If you want to share the video/audio you are watching...then no. These will not work.",0
5.0,BEST,"August 7, 2018",Yes,These are the BEST wireless headphones that I have come across.  My only very small complaint is I wish the controls on the ear muffs were a bit more defined and easier to feel for.  Again that is a very small complaint overall these are great for the gym and everyday use.  The connection is great and the sound is awesome!  I will most definitely be buying another pair.,0
4.0,A little heavy,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"These are a little heavy for my comfort when running, but otherwise very comfortable. I'll be purchasing smaller earbuds for exercise, and will use these when I'm stationary. Volume is good and easily adjustable. Track fwd/back buttons are easily found without looking. Overall I'm very happy.",0
5.0,A great product..,"March 12, 2018",Yes,This is by far one of the best bluetooth headphones I have. I have used it for almost 3-4 weeks for now..- Battery life is great. It did give me 20 hours or more of play time..- It looks great. and is very sturdy..- Voice quality is great..- It folds very neatly and takes up very small space..- Setting up was a breeze.. the range is good.. Overall super happy..Few minor complaints.- operating the play/pause/volume controls is not very easy.. sometime you end up pressing the wrong buttons.. also the controls work with phone settings but not necessarily with apps...- it could feel heavy at times....Overall a great product for the price..,0
3.0,"Great for first 8 months, and then glitches started...","July 8, 2018",Yes,"I bought these last summer (Aug 2017). For the first 8 months (approx), they worked great and I would def give them 4 stars. However, few months back, glitches started to happen as sometimes they would disconnect with no obvious reason. In addition, it would take a long time for me to be able to connect them to my phone again. They would work again for a while, and then back to having these glitches... Last week, they completely stopped working.",0
5.0,fantastic headphones!,"December 26, 2017",Yes,"My daughter really wanted a pair of wireless headphones for Christmas. After doing some research, I ended up purchasing these for her. So far, they are incredible! She keeps talking about how crystal clear the sound is, and how well they work. Given the price wasn't too high, I would highly recommend these!",0
5.0,But I am totally satisfied with these headphones,"May 31, 2018",Yes,"I don't have any experience with high quality and expensive headphones, so I can't compare it with those! But I am totally satisfied with these headphones! I use it while hiking, and running, and sometimes listening to audiobooks at bed time! The quality of sound is good and the battery lasts a lot.",0
5.0,Highly recommend for the budget minded,"December 15, 2017",Yes,"I don't regret getting this. I love the sound coming out of it. It is not like higher end headphones but you generally won't notice. For the price, the sound has good range. It gets the highs and lows. I especially love the flexibility with the connection. I can use a direct 3.5mm cable or use Bluetooth. Pairing is very easy.",0
5.0,Fantastic! Will buy again.,"December 11, 2017",Yes,These are fantastic headphones.  Power lasts all day.  Comfy and never loose signal with my cell phone...This is the second pair of these I have bought.  I purchased the first pair for my brother's birthday.  He loved the gift and he raved about them.  As such I picked up a pair for myself and I couldn't be happier.,0
5.0,Easy to use with bluetooth,"January 9, 2018",Yes,Purchased for 15 year old son and he loves it. Easy to use with bluetooth. Comes with headphone wires.  He stated it provides quality sound and fits comfortably over ears.  Now its hard to communicate with him since he’s always using them! Maybe he just intentionally uses it to drown out my nagging to complete his chores!!,0
3.0,Disappointing Purchase,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"I bought these a few days ago and they arrived in the mail yesterday. I was really excited to test drive them at the gym today. They passive noise cancellation worked, but the bass was terrible. Like almost non existent. This was interesting as there were several comments about the sound quality being really good. I like everything else about the earphones, but I must send back as the reason I purchased was because the sound on my previous headphones was waning. Yes these are louder, but the sound (specifically the bass) on the older ones is leaps and bounds better than the MPOWs. Disappointed.",0
5.0,Not a bad buy for the price,"December 18, 2017",Yes,I was looking for a pair of inexpensive over the ear headphones for work. These were rated pretty good by previous buyers. I decided to give them a shot. They have a very good sound quality for the price. They are easy to connect to Bluetooth. They headphone material is a little cheap. I would recommend these.,0
5.0,Great quality of product and sounds,"September 11, 2018",Yes,Very comfortable for my 11 year old. Like that they go over the ears and not just on the ear. Good sound quality. Lovely carrying case. Pay attention to charging requirements. Mine was fully charged in 4 hours and has taken most of the day to run out.,0
4.0,Comfortable but doesn't block much noise.,"March 18, 2018",Yes,"Very comfortable, sound is fine, and they dont give me tinnitus like earbuds do...I'm disappointed at how little it blocks out outside noise. I know they arent ANC but i expected more muffling at least. Without music it's almost like I'm not wearing headphones, with music it's better but I can still hear a lot. But I would say they are still pretty good headphones especially for the price",0
5.0,Wonderful,"April 12, 2018",Yes,I really like these headphones. They’re comfortable on your ears. The sound is clear and precise. Haven’t had any issues so far. It’s only been a week.  But so far they’re excellent. If something changes I will update my review. You really can’t beat the quality of this product at this price point.,0
4.0,Great customer service,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"These headphones started off working well but within 2 days quit working. The noise cancelling feature would not work at the gym and they would no longer connect wirelessly..After posting my issue with my initial headphones, the manufacturer sent me a replacement pair of headphones which are working extremely well and I'm truly enjoying them! Thank you for your wonderful customer service!",2
5.0,Amazing Headphones!,"November 19, 2017",Yes,"I've been looking for a new pair of headphones for gaming (World of Warcraft raiding with use of Discord voice program), and these are amazing! Easy to pair with my computer (Lenovo Yoga) - just charged them and they worked like a charm! I have yet to test the microphone part, but the sound is great. They're very comfortable, too...UPDATE: I've tested the microphone part and have no issues with it! The only thing is, is that sometimes the Bluetooth cuts out for a few seconds (about 3) but comes right back.",0
5.0,Very nice headphones,"August 9, 2017",Yes,"I am very pleased with these headphones. I didn't set out to buy wireless headphones, but since they could be used either way I decided to get them. Now that I have used them wirelessly, I am very happy I chose these ones. It's very nice going for a walk and not having the wire hanging around...They fit nicely on my head and are very comfortable.",0
5.0,Awesome Sound Quality!!! Love my new heafphones!,"December 5, 2017",Yes,"I bought the matte gold Beat headphones..My 15 year old daughter loves the sound quality...amazing! It arrived on time...5 business days. One complaint...she said the cushion on the headphone was pushed in somewhat because of the packaging, but it has smoothed out over night. It folds up nicely! A must buy!",0
4.0,Great headphones,"March 18, 2018",Yes,"These are great! Especially for the price, I am amazed with them. The sound is good, they connect to Bluetooth quickly and they are comfortable to wear. My only issue is that they do no block out sound very well. I know they aren’t noise canceling but when using them on a plane or bus I can hear everything around me still unless the volume is up pretty high",0
5.0,"... on the web page and are every bit as nice as ""brand name"" headphones that I also own","November 8, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are exactly as represented on the web page and are every bit as nice as ""brand name"" headphones that I also own.  The fit and finish are excellent.  Sound quality is also very nice.  The controls are intuitive and easy to use.  I paired it with an iPhone and haven't figured out how to ask Siri a question with them on, but that is about the only concern I might have and it certainly is not an issue to just use the phone to summon Siri...<a class=""a-link-normal"" data-hook=""product-link-linked"" href=""/Mpow-059-Bluetooth-Headphones-Over-Ear-Hi-Fi-Stereo-Wireless-Headset-Foldable-Soft-Memory-Protein-Earmuffs-w-Built-in-Mic-and-Wired-Mode-for-PC-Cell-Phones-TV/dp/B01NAJGGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mpow 059 Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear, Hi-Fi Stereo Wireless Headset, Foldable, Soft Memory-Protein Earmuffs, w/ Built-in Mic and Wired Mode for PC/ Cell Phones/ TV</a>",0
5.0,These are very good headphones,"November 5, 2017",Yes,I only use these when I am working out.  They are perfect.  For some reason my gym insists on playing a radio station that is just awful.  These headphones to the trick.  While they are not noise reducing the over ear design works well.  I am amazed at the quality of the sound at this price point.  I am impressed with them.  I just bought a pair for my wife.,0
5.0,Listening music wasn't great using this headphone because the connection wasn't stable and ...,"April 28, 2018",Yes,"Listening music wasn't great using this headphone because the connection wasn't stable and I heard strange ""Too Too"" sound from this head phone while listing a music...Updated.  The company really cares about its customers. I will review their new product soon.",0
4.0,Amazing but...,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"the power on/off button doesn't work well. you have to touch it in the right spot and hold it for like 10 seconds. super annoying. other than that, amazing sound quality and the battery lasted for literally weeks of moderate use. does a great job blocking sound also.",0
5.0,Good sound !!,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"I have older music devices that are not blue tooth enabled. This head set is perfect balance for everything. I am happy with the sound quality, fit and finish.",1
5.0,Cost effective product,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"I have now used it for 2 weeks. Too bad I did not by an over-the-ear blue-tooth headphone a long time ago. It blocks out most sound of the inconsiderate loud people at the gym. Connected easily to my phone. Comfortable and secure. Sometimes a problem when my phone switches to a different wifi connection, but will easily reconnect. In short, a great product for the cost and would not hesitate to recommend.",0
4.0,Quite decent for the price,"October 15, 2018",Yes,"I only have occasional needs for over-the-ear headphones (while flying mostly) so for that purpose they are fine. I like the option of wireless or wired. Sound quality is decent for the price, but won't win any audiophile contests!",0
5.0,"Great product, easy to use","September 20, 2018",Yes,"Love this product. I have tried Bluetooth speakers before with mixed results but these headphones are great. They block out ambient noise and deliver clear sound. Pairing is easy, although I have to remember not to have Bluetootn on my computer and smartphone on at the same time or the headphones get confused. May consider an Mpow upgrade in the future.",1
5.0,Never knew how much I needed this,"September 20, 2018",Yes,"This is great. Connects easily to my phone. I listen to a lot more music nowadays because of it. Also, it's got a microphone and people can hear me just fine during calls.",1
2.0,Stopped charging 4 months in.,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"I have had these since July 2018 and they are awesome! But now they are not charging and I have left them on the charger for over 24 hours, still not charging. They work if they are plugged in to the charger, but if I take them off The charger they stop working. Does this have a warranty?",0
5.0,Great product,"September 26, 2018",Yes,"They're in perfect condition, the sound it great, and they're very simple to use..I just got these today so I'm not sure how the battery life is, but I marked 5star because im sure it's just as good as the rest of the headset..Love them so far!",0
5.0,Great deal,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these headphones were a great deal. I have had them for over three months and they have worked great. They are a bit tight against my head which causes pain around my ears if I wear them for a couple hours, but for normal use they have been great.",0
5.0,These headphones are amazing. I like the fact that I can use ...,"January 15, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are amazing.  I like the fact that I can use the cord for elliptical machines that aren’t bluetooth to watch my Netflix, then when I am done i wrap up the cord and store in my arm sleeve with my phone, turn my tunes on and head to the weight room.  With it being a over ear type I can totally tune out all of the grunting and loud dropping of weights...be in my own world doing my own thing.  I charged it the first day and on my 10th time to the gym since I bought them on Dec 28th, I haven’t had to charge yet.  I always make sure to power off when I put in my bag.  It comes with a really nice drawstring bag to store in.  The control buttons that are on right side of headphones are very easy to use.  Thumbs way up!",0
2.0,Not sure how this could get worse,"July 20, 2017",Yes,This product gets two starts instead of one for customer service and comfort. This headset desyncs every time I turn it off and I have to completely uninstall and reinstall the driver to even try to use it. The audio quality is also absolutely terrible. Save your money and get a better headset. I returned the first one and got a replacement with the same issues.,1
4.0,"Snug, but not uncomfortable. It has a good battery life.","February 22, 2018",Yes,"These are really good. Better than the other headphones I had in the past. The sound is really great and clear. It's a little snug sometimes but that doesn't bother me too much. The battery lasted three days on one charge for me. If something were to happen to my current one, I would definitely buy more of these because I absolutely love them!",0
5.0,good service and good earphones,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"Easy to use but it broke three days after receiving it.  The plastic button fell off while I was listening to a YouTube video.  I tried to replace it, but it does not snap back in place.  The company made good on their replacement.  Great sound, comfortable and reliable bluetooth earphones.",0
4.0,Good headphone,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"The headphone is good with its price. I am satisfied with it. The noise reducing is not so good. Others can hear the voice when you put on it. However, it is a good phone in its cheap price. It is good for those who are looking for cheap price headphone. The fuctions work well.",0
4.0,Almost perfect,"March 7, 2018",Yes,"The headphones are comfortable and they feel like they have a quality build. My only complaint is the frequency response of the headphones, it's not bad, but they seem to lack a little bit on the higher frequencies (AKA sound a little muffles) for my particular taste. On the other hand, for the price, I would buy these again.",0
1.0,Short life span,"February 12, 2018",Yes,"Bought these in Sept 2017. They lasted only 5 months and then simply stopped working. It's not like they experienced a ton of ""wear and tear"" either. They were primarily used in my home. I know they aren't high end headphones but given the (bogus?) great reviews I still expected a longer lifespan than 5 months.",2
5.0,Best headphones ever .,"September 5, 2018",Yes,"I really like it , the sound is really good and the material looks nice and strong .i love it .",3
2.0,"Sound is garbage, mic is fine, battery life is great.","September 2, 2018",Yes,"I watch movies and I talk to people online with my headsets. The sound through the earpieces is VERY muffled and is atrocious. Everyone I spoke to online said the mic was fine. The best part of the whole product is the decent battery life, but that was probably in part because the sound was so bad. If the sound was tolerable I would have given it more stars.",1
5.0,So far so good. Very good noise canceling just from the headphones,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"So far so good.  Very good noise canceling just from the headphones.  Very comfortable.  Good build quality.  If you go with bluetooth understand the differences and simple laptop bluetooth is not as good as the dongle you can get.  It will work, but will sound like am radio, but worse.  Higher end bluetooth will solve the problem.  Google it and get the highest version.",0
4.0,Pretty good for the price,"September 15, 2018",Yes,"I like these headphones better than I thought I would.  They are relatively comfortable and have good, but not great sound quality.  The replacement that they kindly sent me, was much higher in fidelity and I have increased my rating to 4 stars.",0
5.0,Comparable to the more expensive headphones if not better,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"I'm an avid music listener and when i purchase a pair of headphones I want the best of the best. Initially I bought these just to use the bluetooth feature at the gym. Unfortunately my iphone is having some type of connectivity issues with the bluetooth (its the phone not the product) but luckily these come with wire that you can use directly and I must say I am impressed I have owned a pair of Dre beats, SOL headohones, and Soul headphones all of these products were $200 dollars I paid $25 dollars for these and after listening to the quality I've come to the conclusion that these name brand companies are getting over. GREAT PRODUCT GREAT SOUND GREAT COMFORT GREAT DEAL I plan to purchase another pair for personal use and use the ones I have now for the gym.",0
5.0,"Excellent - comfort, good sound, battery lasts a long time.","March 2, 2018",Yes,"These are so worth the money. I use them for commuting and they are fantastic. Comfortable, they fold up nicely and sound is real good too. And the battery lasts a long time. I only have to charge it once a week and use it for a good 3 hours a day You cant find a better deal in headphones. I bought a pair for my daughter too because she loved them.",0
3.0,You'll want a longer USB cable and a power bank because you're never going to want to take these off.,"February 13, 2018",Yes,"I knew that when I put these on my head to test the feel, that they would be perfect. That I had finally found my perfect match in headphones...Playing ""Coming Home"" by Avenged Sevenfold was just further sealing my fate...These are the comfiest headphones I have ever had the pleasure to place on my head. They're hella cute too (got them in blue) I didn't even realize it came with a jack for an audio cable, but finding that out was the best surprise...EDIT:.I had to edit my review down to 3 stars because the fabric of the headpiece has begun to pull apart from the frame, exposing the foam on the inside.",0
5.0,Works as advertised,"September 11, 2018",Yes,I wear these at the gym. Better than ear buds bcuz they block out the obnoxious music the gym plays. They fit better than other headphones so it's like listening to my music in an otherwise quiet room. They're not 100% noise cancelling but close to it. I'd definitely recommend. Much better than what I expected for the price.,0
5.0,Buy them!!!,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"First off, I ordered these on Sunday and they came Monday which was even a holiday for USPS. Second, these headphones are amazing! Super great price and they are waaaaay better than I expected. Hooked up with Bluetooth and I left my phone across the house and they still worked with out skipping a beat. Answering the phone is a breeze and the mic works great. Would recommend these to anyone and everyone!",0
4.0,Good for the cost,"May 4, 2017",Yes,"I bought these headphones to help block out the sound of my office while I'm working. They are good for this purpose, however when you turn the headphones on/off there is a pretty loud and annoying voice prompt, every time. I haven't been able to find a way to turn this off. These headphones also leak sound at any volume. I sit very close to my coworkers so those last two points aren't ideal for my situation...Otherwise, the sound and comfort are satisfactory. I think they're a good deal overall for your average headphone wearer. I do wish I could turn off the voice prompts!",1
3.0,You will hear the outside noice.,"August 16, 2018",Yes,I bought this headset thinking I would be listening to pure sounding music. Now I do know that they are not noise canceling it from the reviews I read people bragged on how much they canceled the outside noise. Well they did not .. I heard the outside noise and are not comfortable at all. Will be returning them.,1
5.0,Great product even without amplifier,"October 11, 2017",Yes,"Incredible buy for the price! These headphones are great by themselves, although max volume is a little quiet for my hearing-impaired ears, as with any headphones a small amplifier would easily solve this issue!",1
4.0,Nice...but not quite there,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"Nicely constructed, though you should take care when folding/unfolding, or even when adjusting on your ears (I've broken a very nice pair I had from Monoprice--that they don't sell anymore). The fit is good and snug, covering the ears well. The bass is not what I was hoping for. I've yet to recapture that bass from the Monoprice set. Still a decent pair of phones tho, for the price anyway...Really more of a 3.5 but there's no option for a half star, so I just bumped it up because of fit, price, and look. Still in search of a pair with great bass and decent price...if someone has located some here on Amazon, drop me a recommendation. I'd appreciate it!",0
5.0,Block out annoying coworker,"March 3, 2018",Yes,I bought these to block out the annoying person in the cubical next to me that eats ice cubes all day long. They work perfectly and fully block out the terrible ice chomping noises. They are very comfortable and easy to operate just make sure you charge them when you first get them.,0
4.0,Served my purpose and good for the price!,"November 25, 2017",Yes,Comfortable to wear and sound is ok for the price. Doesn't compare to my Sennheisers' but then again didn't cost anywhere near as much. They work well for my purpose on my business computer to listen to tutorials. I am glad I bought them. I had to buy an extension plug in because because my computer tower is on the floor.,0
5.0,They sound good and they pared nicely,"February 21, 2018",Yes,These are a pleasant surprise.  They sound good and they pared nicely.  Batteries seem to have good life.  All of this taking into account their very reasonable price.  Looking for a good set of Bluetooth headphones for a modest price give these a whirl..  Their range is pretty good too.  Thanks!!!,0
5.0,Many Hours of Battery,"November 7, 2018",Yes,I have been super impressed with these headphones. I have had these for a couple of months and with light use at work have only had to charge them twice! The bonus is the built in microphone that can be used for video calls and answering phone calls.,0
5.0,Great buy,"May 2, 2018",Yes,What these headphones for my eight year old son he seems to enjoy them very much.  he really originally had some beats that his grandmother bought him but unfortunately they broke and had to be sent back and she never got them replaced so I bought these instead they're The Perfect Replacement no complaints.,0
5.0,Great value for price,"September 29, 2017",Yes,Decent sound. I decided to get another pair of over ear headphones as in ear headphones can contribute to hearing loss even if listening at low volumes. I find these very comfortable and the sound seems much fuller and clearer than most in ear headphones...Now I can listen to tv or watch movies late without disrupting others at night..,0
1.0,Do not purchase! Cute but faulty.,"June 3, 2018",Yes,I had to return them.  They wouldn't charge up for more than 5 minutes. The company told me to try different charging cables and outlets. Nothing worked.,1
3.0,Quality matches price point. Pinchy with Weak sound.,"March 16, 2018",Yes,"Easy to use, an inexpensive..Sound is OK but not great. Clearly lose detail in audio..Even though it is 'over ear' they still seem to pinch and I can only wear them for so long before my ears begin hurting...For the price point they are ok for light use, but I would not recommend for them for all-day use, and definitely not being used in any professional audio capacity.",0
5.0,Great for Misophonia!,"June 14, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are amazing. I got them because I have Misophonia and work in a cubicle type setting. My coworkers talk loud, crackle bags, chew loud, clip nails, and various other noises that annoy me. My ear buds didn't do the trick. These headphones make it so I can't hear anything else. My coworkers tested this by raising their voices at me and I couldn't hear it. They fold easy and are very comfortable. Easy to pair with phone and easy to pause and control volume. And the price is amazing. No complaints here. Except I'd love a pink version lol.",1
4.0,Great service!,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Sounded good but broke within 6 months. Disappointed..Update: Received a replacement in one week after the first one stopped working. Amazing how the company responded with prompt service! My son is now happy to keep using his favorite headphones on his PC. Thank you!,0
5.0,Great Headphones,"February 5, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. I use them when I’m working in my home office, to music or listening to books. Great sound, it muffles a lot of outside noise, but not so much that you don’t know what’s going on around you. I love the button on the earpiece to turn them on and off. Pairs easily with my devices.",0
5.0,Way better quality and performance than expected,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"It sounds great. I had sounds Skullcrushers that cost way more than these and when they broke I bought these and was impressed with how well it sounds. The battery lasts a really long time when I charge it completely, I mean weeks without having to charge it and I go to the gym at least 3 times a week for at least an hour and use them the whole time I'm there. The only somewhat down side is it does taking longer to charge than any other Bluetooth headset I've owned but I don't mind at all with how long they last after they charge.",0
5.0,Buy these asap!,"September 6, 2017",Yes,For inexpensive bluetooth headset it's quite nice. Got it charged it and immediately connected to my galaxy s8. Works great. The microphone works well. They are very comfortable as well. I like them better than my wired $80 turtle beaches. Definite buy if you are looking for a beginner wireless headset.,1
5.0,Nice sound with clarity,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Nice sound with clarity. I was searching for volume and I got that with these. Happy with this purchase..The only issue I had was suddenly, they would not pair with my phone. Finally I realized the only way to fix this issue, was to “forget the device” on my phone, re-pair and wha la!  It worked.",0
5.0,work great a little annoying how the on button also pairs/unpairs ...,"April 14, 2018",Yes,"work great a little annoying how the on button also pairs/unpairs but I am used to it. sound great, comfortable and like how you can also plug them in if blue tooth isn't working which my last blue tooth headphones didn't have so when blue tooth stopped working, the headphones were useless.",0
5.0,These are 5x better and sound absolutely perfect,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"Ok I was skeptical about a $35 pair of Bluetooth headphones....  I am now convinced Mpow is for real.  I have both the $25 pair and these.  These are 5x better and sound absolutely perfect.  No they are not Bose but they aren’t $250 either.  I think the sound is crisp, treble and bass are are simply awesome.  I’m so happy I tried these.  I have been testing them with TSO, (Trans-Siberian Orchestra).  If you don’t know who TSO is, they are awesome and play very dynamic music, I love the Christmas albums and it’s a great test for these headphones.  I’d buy these over and over again...",0
5.0,These work really well and are my favorite of the three I've had,"May 31, 2018",Yes,"I am on my 3rd pair of over the ear wireless headphones. I use them primarily for work - I'm a reporter, and I record meetings and interviews and then listen back. These work really well and are my favorite of the three I've had. These are an excellent value for the price.",0
5.0,Good quality,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"This is not a high end set, but for the money they are excellent Bluetooth musical from my phone.  Pairing took a couple of tries but not too hard.  To pair with my Fire tablet had to shut off phone but then it paired first try.  These are exactly what I wanted.  Good price, good quality.",0
5.0,Great performing headphones.,"March 29, 2018",Yes,Super happy with the headphones. I've been listening to Pandora pretty much all day. Watched a few videos on YouTube. Took two phone calls with them. Can't beat the sound quality for Pandora and YouTube. Not quite as good for phone calls but very acceptable. I like them I recommend them.,0
1.0,Not what I was expecting,"April 26, 2017",Yes,"I have had these headphones for about a week. At first I loved them!!  I was so excited. Felt good and with amazing sound! I use them at my office (we have noisy cubical area) and at home while doing chores as to not interrupt others. Again amazing!! I was so happy with the range and the quality and the feel........That said the sound is really poor after a week of intermittent use. The sound is already failing. They have never disconnected or dropped but everything sounds grainy, hollow, and scratchy. There were so many positives reviews I was really disappointed.",15
5.0,excellent value for money,"December 15, 2017",Yes,"excellent value for money. Sure they may be a little muddy in the bass, however considering the price they are still unmatched..I also love the fact that they can be driven even without bluetooth at all..Used them on a flight in a plane and the passive noise cancelling is already pretty good..Again, I rate value for money, and these are 5 stars.",0
5.0,and I have been really happy with these since the last week or so that ...,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"I haven't had any decent headphones in a long time, and I have been really happy with these since the last week or so that I've had them. For the price, the sound quality is pretty good! I love that I can put the chord in when I'm at the computer at work, and then turn on the bluetooth in an instant and walk away listening to music from my phone on my lunch break. They do feel a little large, but I've gotten used to that. The over the ear design is very good at noise canceling. If you do need to hear any outside noise for safety or other reasons, I would leave one ear slightly off. Overall, good quality for the price.",0
5.0,"Quality,Price,same day delivery.","January 25, 2018",Yes,"I have used many Bluetooth headphones from $20 to $200 price ranges but this headphone has been wonderful even it’s only one week of using it. Sound quality is good, wish there is more bass in to this set. But for the price it’s a superb buy..Highly recommend and will buy again I did and up buying suggested case by amazon which is nice as well",0
5.0,Great simple and good value for money,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"Arrived right on time, bought them for my son,.He loves them, great for kids, they are tough on cables, so blue tooth is great for  use with his devoces that have it, and the headphone cabel that comes with it and is detachable at both ends os great for use with devices without bluetooth and for when the battery is dead, plus the cable can be easily and cheaply replaced if damaged or lost.",0
3.0,"product support is sub standard at best, go to a brick and mortar store you ...","March 28, 2018",Yes,"You get what you pay for nothing more, sound fades in and out, product support is sub standard at best, go to a brick and mortar store you will be better served and if you have issues, it's easier to return...Patozon, the company who brokered this sale, sent an upgraded model as replacement, it has a few more tuning features, comfort wise the original set is much better. Again for the money, either set is okay, from the beginning my only concern was it being defective out of the box!",0
5.0,These sound great and for the price,"October 21, 2017",Yes,"These sound great and for the price, you cant beat them.  I was sort of in the market for the real expensive brand name headphones but these fit the bill just perfect.  I have a larger head and most headphones don't quite come down far enough to have a little wiggle room over my ears but these have a slight bit left over for adjusting for comfort.  Highly recommend!",0
5.0,Great sound Excellent Fit,"April 26, 2018",Yes,These paired right up with my Moto Z2 Droid. Work great and very comfortable. I wear them working out and they stay on and fit very comfortably..Sound is great. Very happy with my purchase. I do wipe them down after each use to keep the soft pads in nice shape.,0
5.0,My son loves them,"December 24, 2017",Yes,My son hasn't had these headphones long but so far he loves them and says they are very clear. He also said they're  very comfortable to put on. He's pretty discriminating about sound so if he says they're clear sounding I believe him. Now if they last a pretty good amount of time then they'll be A+++,0
5.0,"Great sound quality for the price, great battery life","September 26, 2018",Yes,"Although I was disappointed that the microphone could not be used while playing video games without sacrificing sound quality, this headset can be used with a standalone mic to make a great set up. The sound quality is great and I can use the headset for several gaming sessions without having to recharge it.",0
5.0,Great product at a reasonable price,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"I have been using these for about 10 days.  They are comfortable.  They sound great.  Quite a value for the price.  One caution is that people say they cannot hear me well when I am speaking.  I do not know if my one pair has a bad microphone, or if it is an issue in general with the model.",0
5.0,Very comfortable!,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable long wearing headphones. Great sound and talking, Bluetooth connection works with my phone and computer. Long lasting charge, lasted week after initial charging. I wear these for a few hours at a time doing homework to drown out talking and other distraction. Would definitely buy again.",0
5.0,These are really nice and sound quality is great,"April 4, 2018",Yes,"These are really nice and sound quality is great. Price range is the best. I am not a recording engineer, so i did not need $300 headphones to enjoy my Neil Diamond albums. I bought them mostly for air travel, but have not had a chance to try them on the plane yet. I hope they will tune out engine noise, baby screams and the over the ear style should be obvious enough to deter pesky seat mates from trying to strike up a conversation with me.",0
4.0,Great product!,"October 26, 2018",Yes,Bought these for a long distance flight. Used for a quick vacation to FL. Loved the fact they are Bluetooth and wired!! And the battery life is great...Only downside is after a while wearing them they tend to feel heavy.,0
4.0,Great sound for an affordable price.,"March 15, 2018",Yes,"Great sound, comfortable ""Over the Ears"". Pairs easily. Re: controls, volume and skip work good but off button sometimes doen't work too well..Overall very good for the price. Taking calls is excellent. Callers say they hear me fine. Use on my tractors for mowing etc. also weed-whacking..Cuts down on noise. Lasts all day. Would buy again.",0
5.0,Exactly what I wanted!,"October 29, 2018",Yes,"I really like these headphones.  After searching hours on the internet for the right pair of over-ear headphones that didn't cost a fortune, a friend recommended these to me.  I was a little unsure of them because they were so cheap (you get what you pay for sort of thought process), but I am actually really happy with them.  The design isn't to obtrusive and it has great battery life.  The connection only goes for about 33feet which is one of my least favorite parts, but I can handle this one downside when compared to all of the good!  I would highly recommend these headphones!",0
4.0,win situation as they came in his favourite colour of green,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"Read the reviews over and decided on these as purchased them for my twelve year Grand Son (as a Xmas Stocking stuffer) and it was a win, win situation as they came in his favourite colour of green!  That said; cannot honestly comment on their performance however they do appear to be well made and were also well packaged.",0
2.0,They are very comfortable and sound great,"March 10, 2018",Yes,"Bought these headphones twice and both times they only lasted about six months.  They are very comfortable  and sound great, when they work.  Disappointed.",1
5.0,Excellent purchase,"August 5, 2018",Yes,Pros: comfortable..1. Good volume and surround sound..2. Adjustable for a perfect position..3. Battery lasts for hours..4. Excellent quality for this price..5. Easy pairing..6. Sound is great..7. I strongly recommend it...Cons: none.,1
3.0,No Thrills Basic Headphones,"October 24, 2017",Yes,"These are okay, the price makes them worth it...My opinion on these is if you are looking for a no thrills earphone to use while laying in bed so others can sleep, then these work...The sound is mediocre at best, very little depth to the sound with lots of treble and no bass, works good for watching sports or a reality show with no music, movies or Netflix/HBO series shows will not sound good...Also I found that if you wear them for over an hour, they do start to hurt your ears a little bit.",0
5.0,Great audio and customer service,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"Product works perfectly as headphones, but the microphone was an added feature for me and isn’t as good as you’ll get with a gaming headset. Still the audio is fantastic and is I’d say the audio is just as good or better than a lot of more expensive headphones available...Do your own research if you want a good microphone this product isn’t what your looking for. But I’d definitely recomend it got single player games music and videos...Also great customer service. My dog chewed up my headphones and they offered me a new pair at a $5 discount which i didn’t expect because it wasn’t a problem with their product...I like the product and the customer service and can say with confidence that this Is probably the best wireless headphones you’ll get for under $40.",0
2.0,Not for me,"June 26, 2017",Yes,The sound quality is very nice but unfortunately they don't get very loud and I also hate that they constantly flash while in use. I like to use headphones at night and the flashing on the side of my head is horrible. Will be returning,1
5.0,Worth it but..,"July 13, 2017",Yes,The sound quality is way better than I expected. It's a nice comfortable fit for my ears. I'm a little disappointed about the fact that the microphone doesn't work unless the headphones are turned on. I have a PlayStation that doesn't support Bluetooth headphones and I wanted to use the microphone but when I plugged in the wire into my headphones and controller the headphones turned off automatically and I couldn't use the mic but other than that the headphones are so worth the price,0
5.0,Comfort And Quality,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"My son's expensive Yamaha headphones kept falling apart. I read many reviews before deciding on these and glad we did!  They were much less but he likes them even better. Great comfort, sound and he says they are pretty good at noise cancellation, even though they are not advertised as such.",0
5.0,"Great sound, very comfortable.","March 9, 2018",Yes,"Have had headphones in the past but liked earbuds when I exercise, my old headphones (wired) were comfortable but bulky and a bit heavy. Thought i’d Try these an glad I did. Very light weight, comfortable and keep my ears warm in the cold. Definitely recommend this headphone.",0
3.0,Nice Color,"March 18, 2017",Yes,Little hard on the ears if you wear glasses and or hearing aid,3
5.0,Amazing deal!,"August 19, 2018",Yes,"Very good headphones. Extremely good deal. A little tight on the head but they have good padding so it's not uncomfortable. Great for listening to music on your phone or something along those lines. Pretty solid on a PC as well. Would not recommend using them for gaming, their sound stage is a little hollow and indistinct for sound direction. But overall, can't complain one bit. Love it.",0
5.0,Great value.  Very close to the quality of headphones that cost 3 times as much.,"June 25, 2018",Yes,These work great.  Very happy with the value of these.  I know that I could get better response and clarity but I would have to pay 3 times as much and just don't see those 150 dollar headphones as being worth it..These are great deal for the price.,0
4.0,Great headphones,"October 22, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this headphones so I can listen to lectures for my online college classes. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but I wanted something with good sound quality and good range. I read several reviews on these headphones and decided to give it a try due to the reviews. I am glad that I did. I am able to listen to the lectures and not hear my granddaughter crying and screaming in the other room. I can also walk around my entire home and not loose range. The price is the best part of this entire purchase.",0
1.0,These linked up fine but only work if your phone is within 2 ...,"January 7, 2018",Yes,These linked up fine but only work if your phone is within 2 feet of the headphones and a clear line of sight.  Forget putting them in a pocket or such.  I returned them the same day.,1
1.0,Fell apart in 7 months. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"November 13, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my husband in May so he has only had them ~7 mo. The material covering the foam that goes over the top of his head has come completely undone. I expect a pair of headphones to last longer than this.,0
4.0,it was quite good. Mids and highs were crisp and clear,"August 21, 2017",Yes,"I have recently received these headphones. Sound quality was OK but when you consider the price, it was quite good. Mids and highs were crisp and clear, but bass was acceptable at best. But for under $40? Good value so far. Build quality seems good and it fits nicely on the ears. I suspect that over a prolonged period, it could be uncomfortable but I have not used it longer than an hour at a time. I cannot comment on durability yet but will update if a comment becomes necessary one way or the other.",0
5.0,Great for the money.,"May 5, 2018",Yes,Great for the price...It is loud enough through bluetooth but it is definitely louder if you use the cord...Sound is better than I expected for the price.  These are also very comfortable.  You can wear them for hours without hurting your head or ears.,0
2.0,One thing I've noticed within the first few minutes of ...,"July 14, 2018",Yes,"One thing I've noticed within the first few minutes of using these headphones is that a lot of noise escapes out the back side of the headphones while I'm wearing them, which defeats the purpose of wearing headphones in the first place. Another thing I noticed was that the bass is very lack luster, which I find strange seeing as these are listed as Mpow's ""richer bass"" model.",1
5.0,Great if you want comfort and music,"April 8, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones! I'm simple I just want comfort and some tunes while I work out. Of course these aren't superior sound quality but it's not bad for the average headphones. They are super comfortable and they don't budge. I have a hand full of piercings on my ears and they don't bother me at all. I've worn them running, biking, in the stair master, rower, and weight lifting. I definitely recommend!",0
5.0,Very nice headphones with an even nicer price,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my son but tried them out. They are super comfortable, you could wear them all day! Connection is great, no lost signals (unless you get too far from your device), no static. Also, sound is much better than I thought it would be. I would definitely recommend these!",0
5.0,Top Choice for the Price Sensitive Person,"February 10, 2017",Yes,"For the price I can't complain at all.  The sound quality is very decent and the noise cancellation seems to work fairly well. I was hoping to have these double as a hands free calling headset too, but most people I talk to say it sounds like they're on speaker phone. Likely because the microphone is near my ear and the voice is bouncing off walls and such. There are never any complaints about the other party being able to hear me though. And now that I have these I can work more from home even with the kids running around and playing upstairs because their noise is cancelled out.  Very happy... may buy another pair for the summer yard work season.",0
2.0,Cheap and sound like it....,"May 3, 2017",Yes,"Anyone who says these sound good has no clue what good headphones sound like....the sound quality is below average, they're not even that loud.  They lose bass the louder you go, would not recommend or buy again..Ordering was easy and quick and item arrived on time.",2
1.0,Worked OK for Awhile - now won't pair with any bluuetooth device,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"Worked well for a few weeks, just long enough to not be returnable. Now it won't pair with anything and I have sent two messages to the vendor with no response. I would not advise you to buy this product. Find another brand that will stand behind their product. I now have a $40 paperweight.",1
1.0,Don't buy these if you plan on using the microphone ever,"August 17, 2017",Yes,"I bought these because my job requires me to take calls from my computer, and I like to pace around while I'm on calls so I bought these wireless headsets. The microphone comes in at such a low level that no one can hear me and even if I boost my signal from my computer the level of noise it picks up is unacceptable. These are completely worthless if you're expecting to ever use the microphone on these.",2
1.0,Worked for 7 months. Now battery is dead,"August 14, 2018",Yes,Worked great for 7 months and suddenly today the battery died. Attempted charging however no light comes on showing it is charging (red light)...On the seller page it shows a 18 month warranty. I will update if the seller responds to my email.,0
4.0,Decent Bass and Great Battery Life,"January 2, 2018",Yes,"The headphones are comfortable and the blue-tooth battery life is amazing! The electronics were not damaged while sitting in a mailbox with as low as eleven degrees Fahrenheit! However, the bass is decent and white noise is not blocked out when no music is playing. You can still hear some things when music is playing. Definitely better than earbuds!",0
1.0,"Great design,  POOR sound quality.","August 30, 2017",Yes,"Received order today in the mail,  opened package and paired with phone easily.  Sound quality is very poor,  scratchy on phone call as well as listening to music.  I like the design and feel of the headphones but sound quality is just not there.  returning them today.",2
3.0,It is not comfortable to wear for a long time.,"February 8, 2018",Yes,Not too bad $/value. My problem with this headphones is the design with the flattened area on the top that is cushioned. Most heads have a round shape on the top and this cushion is actually creating pressure rather than more comfort. I am returning it because it is very uncomfortable for me.,0
5.0,"Great sound, and very comfortable.","January 18, 2018",Yes,"Great sound and Very comfortable (and I have big ears)..- Update 2/1/18 - Received a replacement headset after the first one cracked/broke..Customer service is better than I have ever experienced..Previous review - broke already.  headphones still work, but the upper shell is snapped",0
5.0,Better then I expected!,"December 2, 2017",Yes,Sound quality is far above what I expected... Sounds great....Not noise cancelling??? I disagree.. I used these while splitting firewood and my log splitter has no muffler... Guess what?  They sounded great....could barely hear the engine running....As long as the battery life holds out they are a great buy!.Review update- 3 months later still holds good charge and still sounds good... Very happy,0
3.0,Volume too low,"August 20, 2017",Yes,I know bluetooth volume is low but these were too low. Even when plugged in the volume was still way too low. I had to return them.They looked so cool though and had a really good comfortable and rugged design.,1
5.0,Great headphones,"October 25, 2017",Yes,They stay on my head pretty good during my workouts. Great sound for really inexpensive headphones. Better than my apple headphones. I bought these because my apple headphones were consistently slipping out of my ears during workouts and when I was running sometimes my hands would catch on the cord. This solves both of those problems. It’s really a game changer,0
5.0,MPOW for the win!,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"These are fantastic headphones for the price. They're pretty easy to pair with a phone, they keep their charge very well so far, and even my coworker (who uses Bose Bluetooth headphones) says they are pretty comfortable. I wish the on/off and volume +/- buttons were configured differently, but I would purchase these again.",0
4.0,These headphones are good for their price,"October 21, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are good for their price. The comfort of these headphones is amazing, unlike other headphones your ears don’t hurt when you use them and its nice and soft. The visual design on this headphone are good, I like the color and the buttons. The audio defiantly has room for improvement, however for its price is not bad.",0
4.0,"Great product, good quality and fantastic sound","November 9, 2017",Yes,"Great product, good quality and fantastic sound. Headset fit was fine. I really liked everything about them BUT..I wanted RF wireless headset for my TV not a bluetooth headset. These are not FR Headsets. My mistake so I returned them with no problem. If I wanted a bluetooth headset I would definitely purchase these.",0
4.0,Awesome quality except for calls,"September 30, 2018",Yes,Very nice quality sound when listening to music. There are many things in my favorite songs that I never could hear until trying these headphones. Only complaint is how horrible the audio quality is when I am calling someone. I can barely hear them even on the highest volume. Maybe this could be because I have an Apple phone.,0
2.0,Not a preferred headphone model,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"Very bulky, and the headset always pressed on my ears that I couldn’t listen for more than an hour or so until extreme discomfort set it. Very inconvenient calling (I could never be heard clearly) and it would always automatically reconnect to my phone when I disconnected to play audio on my phone-IPhone X. I wouldn’t buy this product again mainly because of the bulk and discomfort..It does however have superb battery life and clear audio",1
3.0,Best purchase I made recently,"January 13, 2018",Yes,I am in love with them. I use them for my conference calls at home and also for the gym.  The only downfall is the range in the gym but that’s typical of wireless. But these are clear and comfortable..Update the Bluetooth won’t connect so I’m returning them :( otherwise I really liked them,0
4.0,People around you can hear what your listening too,"March 25, 2018",Yes,"These are great except for the fact that people around you can hear you music. Which for me, since I want to use it while I’m at the gym, is no good. I didn’t want everyone around me hearing what songs I was playing and listening to my explicit lyrics lol. But if you don’t care if people hear what your playing these are perfect",0
5.0,Great Headphones,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"This is the second time I have bought these headphones.  My frst pair I had for over 2 years, which I only had to replace because they got crushed.  The sound quality is great.  They have a great battery life and look really sleek.",0
5.0,Great Sound for the Price!,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Great sound for the price.  Battery life is surprisingly long.  Very intuitive to use, and perfect for focusing on your music in a noisy situation.  I use them in a noisy open office as my phone headset - have had no complaints from the folks on the other end.  Also works well on plane flights.  Highly recommend.",0
5.0,Great value! Decent for music and great for calls.,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"Comfortabe and functional with a long battery life! Crystal clear call audio and the mic works great. For music, the sound is decent but not amazing. About what you'd expect for the price. It also easily connects to 2 bluetooth devices simultaneously. Overall, great product and incredible value!",0
5.0,"Great Sound Quality, fold up easily and stores in the bag very well, completely IS AS ADVERTISED HIGHLY RECOMMEND!","February 13, 2018",Yes,The second I opened the product it was safely protected and wrapped with bubble wrap I proceeded to open the box for the instructions and these awesome Bebe's had the manual on top along with the bag and the two cords to charge it it also was fully charged once I opened it and begin pairing with my phone it's been an excellent product so far I highly recommend this one! 👍,0
4.0,Better sound when it’s is hard wired compared to Bluetooth,"November 28, 2017",Yes,These are great headphones for the price. I have had them for about couple of weeks and it has been great. The sound is noticeable better when these are wired in using the audio cable provided as compared to Bluetooth. I can’t review the battery life as I have not used them on Bluetooth that long.,0
5.0,Easy,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"Wished I could type love it more than one time in this section. It is easy to connect to my laptop. Its easy to charge, I like the way it fits my big head, hahaha. I maybe ordering another one for a cooworker. I like the way its able to fold and be put in its on bag.",0
5.0,"even the sound is nice, BUT","February 26, 2018",Yes,"It worth the $30... It is working, even the sound is nice, BUT: it is heavy (too much after 2 hours), it is a pain to link with Apple device and/or Windows when you often switch (you usually need to restart the Bluetooth service), and the battery is not so good..EDIT: I had been offered a replacement by the Mpow H2 and I have to say I really appreciate that. The H2 is lighter, more comfortable, and the interface man-machine is well designed. Even the general design, all black and minimalist, is really good..I will definitely recommend the H2 to my friends.",0
5.0,"Love these for beauty and fit! Oh, and sound quality!","August 27, 2017",Yes,"Love these! I have a small ear to crown of head ratio, and all headphones hang too far down past my ears. These are perfect for fellow pin heads! They are very handsome, comfortable and sound great! In love, thanks!",1
4.0,Bad microphone great sound quality and comfort,"February 18, 2018",Yes,"Love the headphones very comfortable on my ears even when wearing for a long period of time, has great bass and is pretty good with noise cancellation you can barely hear stuff even just put in the headphones on like if you're watching TV and you put the headphones on you'll barely be able to hear the TV if you even hear it without even having music on but the one bad thing is the mic is very low for me and when I'm talking to people they say they can barely even hear me but I'm happy it came with a aux cord and a charger which I can also use for my phone",0
5.0,The headphones are easy to use,"April 12, 2018",Yes,"I wear these at work all the time to be able to focus with people talking around me. The headphones are easy to use, very comfortable to wear for hours at a time and hold a charge like I wish my iPhone would! All in all, I've been using these for a month or more and haven't had a bit of trouble. Worth the money and then some!",0
5.0,Incredible Customer Service,"December 5, 2017",Yes,"I was really happy with this headphone when I first got it. But it cracked by itself last month when I was wearing it. I think the material and structure on the top bend need to be redesigned. However, the signal and quality is good...UPDATE:.MPow mailed me a replacement and it works better than the firest one so far. Their customer service is excellent.",0
5.0,Great for watching TV with my wife,"April 24, 2017",Yes,"I like everything about these headphones.  My wife has complained about the volume that I have to have the TV set to for years. I missed a lot of spoken words, punchlines etc. I got these to use with our Hopper 3 with Bluetooth. Wife is happy now until she wants to talk and I can't hear her because I can now hear the TV.  If I had one complaint but I don't. It would be that they are a little snug on my ears. After wearing them for a couple of hours my ears are sore. Maybe a wide head. An adjustment would be appreciated.",6
5.0,"Great value - Annoying feature of flashing light while in use, and loud ""Power On"" recording and tone.","February 22, 2018",Yes,"Great value for the money...I use it to listen to TV while my wife sleeps..My complaints are:.The every few seconds flashing blue light is too much (I covered the light with duct tape)..When you turn the headphones on there is a loud statement saying ""POWER ON"" with a loud tone. This is not useful for when someone next to you is sleeping, and you are trying not to wake them up with sounds...",0
5.0,Love it. Bluetooth AND Wired (for planes); recharges through USB!,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"Bought one for my wife last year, and just bought another one for myself. I like it better than my noise cancelling Bose. The pluses: don't have to keep extra batteries... charges through USB. You can use it with Bluetooth, or wired (e.g, on the plane). Auto-reconnects to your phone/tablet without giving you grief.",0
5.0,Great headphones and even better for phone calls!,"September 3, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones - easily paired, great battery life.  I use them for phone calls - very clear and steady connection with the phone, better than than any wired headset or bluetooth headset I have used (and I have 20+ versions).",1
4.0,They continue being comfortable over a long period of time,"August 26, 2017",Yes,"They function well as headphones. Although they're not noise canceling, they do help block out some outside noise by being over the ear. They continue being comfortable over a long period of time, which is one reason why I decided to buy these. I've used them both as wireless and with the cable that it comes with to connect to your phone. However, they don't function very well to make calls. I've tried using the bluetooth function to make calls but every time, I can't hear very well and the people on the other line have also told me they can't hear me very well. So I don't recommend relying on these to make calls.",0
5.0,"NO MORE WIRE HANG- wait, just no more wires :)","October 28, 2018",Yes,"Use these with my internet phone (work from home). I love being chord free. Sound is great. Sometimes people on the other end complain, but I don’t care much. Working out with these and no wires is the best thing since sliced bread.",0
3.0,"OK, but I would not recommend.","March 1, 2018",Yes,"The sound is decent but the ""passive"" sound canceling does NOTHING to block out external sound. I knew it would not be as effective as ""active"" noise cancellation, but these are worse than ear buds. Unless you plan on using these in a quiet room, I would not recommend them.",0
1.0,I have to change my review. I had to purchase a new charging cord. It will no longer pair with my TV or any blue tooth devices.,"March 29, 2018",Yes,The charging cord went bad. I replaced that. My Fire TV sees it in the pairing mode but it will not pair. That includes any blue tooth devices I have. They lasted about 6 months but for $35 I guess you get what you pay for. I will buy another head set but invest more money.,0
5.0,bulky but effective,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"Bought these headphones for traveling. Although they are bulkier than I expected, these travel well. Sound is good enough for me and outside noise is minimal. Ears do get slightly squashed somewhat but nothing dramatic. This was a good buy for what I needed.",0
5.0,Best wireless headphones,"August 16, 2018",Yes,So far so good! Cancels noise out like a boss and I’ve yet to have the bettery die on me. If I had to guess I’d say it prob last 8-12 hours on a full charge becuase I know I’ve been on it 8 hours and it has yet to say low battery or anything....for the price this is a great set of headphones. I’ve tried other wireless headphones that usually only last 4 hours max and eventually just break down. Get it while the sale lasts if your serious. The noise cancelling is so good that sometimes not my ears are sweaty when I take them off,0
5.0,I reallly like them very comfortable i used them alot but the ...,"June 10, 2018",Yes,I reallly like them very comfortable i used them alot but the mic doesn’t work. I cant talk on phone other end cant hear me And dies  battery doesn’t as last long...Customer service reached out and sent me a replacement they’re perfect thank you,1
1.0,Almost 2 months! Will not connect to any device.,"August 17, 2017",Yes,"Bought this bluetooth headphones back in June 29th 2017 its now August 17th 2017 and the Bluetooth does not connect to any device. If it connects it last for maybe a day or a couple of hours then it disconnects. Then it's a battle to try to connect it to my device.. Very frustrating and disappointing. Have usually had good outcomes with Mpow products, not recommended!",13
5.0,Love!!!,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"My son is super picky and just loves this headset. He's a bigger 14yr old and loves music! This headset is durable and phenomenal! Bluetooth, easy and can be used in other rooms. Great sound clarity and levels (per him) well made. He said it's better than Beats headset. Definitely a good buy!",0
3.0,Mic is nearly nonfunctional,"November 30, 2018",Yes,I want so much to love these. But I bought these to play games and everyone says they can barely hear me or I'm static. They're the most comfortable headphones I've ever had but they're useless without the mic. :(,0
4.0,"Beautiful, clear sound","February 20, 2018",Yes,"Beautiful, clear sound. Pairing was quick and easy to my phone..The buttons on the side are loud when you push them. And I’m concerned other people around me can hear my music when it’s up loud..I ordered a grey pair and I was given a black pair..I recommend these headphones over some $400 Beats.",1
4.0,I like these headphones well enough that I bought a second ...,"April 5, 2018",Yes,"I like these headphones well enough that I bought a second pair to use at work while watching training videos.  They're very comfortable.  The review would have been 5 stars, but I have a very large head and would appreciate a tiny bit more adjustability towards the large side...Even still, they're veey nice and I'm very pleased.",0
4.0,Great Bluetooth Headphones,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"Amazing sound from these bluetooth headphones the volume could be a little louder for me but for the price I am very satified.  I use these with a OnePlus 5T phone and it works very well with it, I'm able to pause, fast forward, rewind and turn the volume up and down on the headphones.",0
5.0,100% Satisfied with my purchase,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"They arrived 80% charged. I tested them for an hour, when I used them the next day they were still at 80%. I used them for nearly two hours, set them down and forgot about them for maybe another 35 mins, remembered they were still on and they were still at 80%. I used them over the next two day for at least 45 mins and they were still at 80%...I didn't consider the battery life when I looked into these, I was more concerned with comfort. I lucked out because they're definitely comfortable and an absolute winner in regards to battery life. I still haven't charged them...Also I've mainly used them to workout and they stay out while running. I sweat a lot too and they handle that no problem.",0
5.0,The Best for your dollar,"February 24, 2018",Yes,For the price this set of headphones is everything a brand charging double offers. But this set of headphones actually works. My battery is good for nearly 3 days of 10 hours of use each day. I can walk near 60 yards indoors or more if outside and get clean reception like it's in my pocket. Sound quality is the best I have found in this price range. Very comfortable. I have zero negatives based on market value at the current price. This product would rate #1 in my rating system. Including all ear bud models.,0
5.0,Very good headset for the price.,"March 26, 2018",Yes,Bluetooth works well and is very nice along with it being my first wireless headset experience. The padding on these is very soft and comfortable. The sound isn't quite what I like but is still very good for the price. When I first opened the package the padding was squashed from being shipped while folded up and I thought it was permanent but after massaging it and letting it sit and warm up it returned to its proper shape. The biggest issue I have with it is there isn't much bass in the sound but that can be adjusted depending on the program you are using on your device. I use spotify mainly and it has an equalizer built in.,0
5.0,""" I order beautiful and great sounding headphones only to see the audio ...","November 26, 2017",Yes,"At this point I am only concerned with ""Latency."" I order beautiful and great sounding headphones only to see the audio play later than the picture. These are the only Bluetooth so far without latency.",1
5.0,Good sound and comfortable.,"March 8, 2018",Yes,Had a small issue but the seller contacted me right away and took care of me...The headphones sound great for the price and fit nicely. I also noticed the range is grate compared to other bluetooth devices I have had in the past. Good bang for the buck definitely.,0
3.0,"REVIEW UPDATE: BASS levels cover the sound of everything else - tested in multiple forms, PC, bluetooth, and spotify","July 17, 2018",Yes,"I bought this under the pretense of all the other reviews on here. I can honestly say with the utmost certainty, i do not understand the positive feedback. The bass levels on this headset are triumphantly louder than any of the other levels of sound this POS emits. Even listening to Christian music or Phil Collins (From Genesis), which are relatively soft, all i hear trumping the vocals is Bass... Wahhhmmm Wuuhmmm Wammmm Wumm... at least that's how i imagine you write how bass might sound. This actually isn't a troll post either. Am i taking crazy pills? am i the only one that hears bass over every other sound in a song with these things? i was very disappointed and prompty contacted customer service for a refund. Don't recommend..UPDATE TO REVIEW: MPOW did right by me.... and i'm VERY impressed. they sent me a free upgrade to my current headphones, the MPOW H2. it sounds amazing! i highly recommend trying that one! great balance and levels.",3
4.0,Time to cut the wire lose,"October 25, 2018",Yes,Having wired headphones while working got in my way as an handyman so it was time for a change. I wanted a good quality Bluetooth headphones but not having to spend a few hundred for a name brand. Music wise the sound is very good but I mainly like to listen to podcasts with them when I'm working.,0
4.0,You can't go wrong for the price!,"August 26, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are awesome. Easy to use, sound clarity is great, and they look good too. I like how the headphones audibly tell you that you have reached the maximum volume one the headphones. The only negative thing about them is that they do feel a little bulky. I wish that the headband and the earpieces were not one curved shape. The design could be better.",0
4.0,Outstanding sound for the $,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"These are outstanding. I bought them for my 12-year-old son, and he absolutely loves them. I tried them out too, and the sound is great! I didn't give a 5 star due to the microphone. If you're buying this to listen to music, movies, or anything else, you'll love it. If you're planning on making calls on it or using the microphone for anything else, I'd look elsewhere. The person on the other end of the call will barely be able to hear you and there's a bunch of static.",1
5.0,Mpow vs Beats? No significant difference!!!,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"I'm not a specialist when it comes to sound-related equipment but this is definitely one with great quality. I was able to compare it to a Beats Studio 3 headphone (10 times the price of this) and they both sounded very similar; in fact, I preferred the clarity on this pair of headphones. The Beats headphones do have slightly better bass performance but it's barely noticeable. I enjoyed the quick pairing functionality and the fact that it comes with a great built-in microphone. Do note that these headphones may be a bit too tight on the ears if worn for more than 2 hours straight, so try to take them off once in a while. If you're on the fence and trying to decide whether or not to get these, get 'em!!!",0
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for,"August 11, 2018",Yes,"I'm delighted with mpow headphones I have now. Their power, their recharge time, the cordless time I have using them are all beyond what I expected. I've used mpow components before, and they are absolutely what I need at a price that is terrific! All good news from here 😀",0
5.0,Just received them and I love them already,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"Just received them and I love them already. Fits comfortably, sound quality is great and pairs quickly with my phone. Bought these since I owned an mpow jaw BT headset which I am extremely satisfied with. I rarely write reviews and therefore it must mean a product has really impressed for me to be writing one!..Good job MPOW on making great products at affordable prices!!",0
5.0,Comfortable with glasses,"December 7, 2017",Yes,"I love these so far they provide great sound. I was most worried about comfort with my glasses, so far they are great. They fit comfortably with my glasses and feel snug enough to move around I wouldn't want to wear them for working out but around the house and on a walk they work great. As for battery life I can't review them for that but if it sucks I'll edit my review.",0
2.0,You get what you pay for,"February 10, 2018",Yes,"I’m always skeptical of Best Selling items since for the most part, they’re of average performance and value price. I learned the hard way however, that you get what you pay for. Sturdy construction, super comfy and easy connectivity aside, the sound quality of these headphones was not what I needed. No bass, muddy guitar and distortion of lows have convinced me to return them and go up a price bracket.",1
5.0,Very pleased with the sound and quality,"March 14, 2018",Yes,Bought 4 of these headphones for the family to work out at the gym. I couldn't bear the purchase of a more expensive set so decided to give these a try. Very pleased with the sound and quality. We have had these now for over 4 months and no issues. I bought another set for a close friend whose Beats head phones broke. Obviously nit the same sound and quality but they agreed the inexpensive MPow 59 we're not a bad substitute for what he had. Very happy with these headphones,0
5.0,Nice headphones for the price,"January 4, 2018",Yes,"These were great headphones for the price. They were a gift for a 7 year old for Christmas. He loved them. They hold a charge well and fit snug on his head. Syncing them to devices was fairly easy. We were even able to sync it to our Samsung TV, which was really cool. Overall, these were a nice product for the price.",0
5.0,Just buy them already!,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"Just like the thousands of similar reviews, I really enjoy these headphones.  They pair easily via Bluetooth to two devices plus they can connect via 1/8 pin plug.  The sound is amazing for such an affordable headset.  They're rechargeable.  They're comfortable.  Just buy them already.",0
5.0,"Comfortable, inexpensive QUALITY product","February 5, 2018",Yes,"I LOVE these headphones. For the price, they have excellent quality sound, are comfortable, and have an insanely long-lasting battery. I generally will charge them only every other week, and I use them for &gt;4 hours/day...The Bluetooth range is pretty good on these- only once I'm around a corner will they cut out. Sometimes while walking the sound will cut in and out for a couple seconds, but if I just touch my phone or wiggle it a bit, the sound goes back to being clear and consistent...I would ABSOLUTELY buy these again. I recommend them to everyone I know who is looking for affordable but high quality over-ear headphones.",0
5.0,but they work pretty well. I've mostly used them as wired headphones,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much out of these headphones, but they work pretty well. I've mostly used them as wired headphones, but the bluetooth isn't bad. My only issue has been as the battery has been low, the connection became poor. They're comfortable and easy to use.",0
5.0,Excellent Patozon Customer Service,"June 16, 2018",Yes,"Original review:.Earphone stopped working after 6 months...Update 6/29/18:.I reached out to Patozon via Amazon and they sent a new pair without question or shipping fee.  I had previously thought there was no support on this product after 90 days, but Patozon made the situation right...In terms of the headphones themselves, they have good audio quality at this pricepoint for mixed usage.  Very comfortable.  However I would say they may not be ideal for sports / running / working out etc",0
5.0,Great deal!,"September 25, 2018",Yes,These things are perfect for travel and for the price an excellent purchase. I used these on a recent flight and they lasted for 3 movies with no signs of dying. There were two young children who acted as little ones can and had no issues with noise. Watched movies and briefly napped in comfort.,0
5.0,Pleasantly surprised,"August 6, 2017",Yes,"Very pleased with these.  I have been using stereo Bluetooth earbuds for years but wanted something different for the treadmill.  The sound quality is not quite as good as my corded headphones at a similar price, but it is much better than I expected.  These are very comfortable and the battery life seems to be very good.",0
5.0,Exceeded expectations.,"November 2, 2017",Yes,"85% of the audio quality of my nice wired headphones (audio technicha) at 1/4 the price. I commute 3 hours every day and I can go for days at a time with a single charge. They feel plasticy, but solid. 6 weeks in, no damage from careful daily use. Works great for phone calls in quiet places, but picks up a decent ammount of background noise when making calls on the street...Would totally recommend.",1
5.0,Updated: Patozon replaced headphones,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"Update:  Shortly after I posted the original, 1-star review, a representative from Patozon emailed me stating they would send a new pair and requesting the serial number to follow up with the manufacturer.  I received the new pair, and am quite happy.  Hopefully the problem with the first pair was a fluke.  I'm quite impressed with Patozon for reaching out to me and replacing the headphones, so I'm upgrading my review...The headphones worked great for a few months. Unfortunately, the control button on the earpiece came loose, and disappeared. For a while I was able to use a pen to turn them on and off, now I can't even do that.",0
5.0,Updated review: 5stars for customer service,"August 27, 2018",Yes,"Update: the company responded to my review and sent me a replacement pair with smaller earphone parts. They are amazing now. Not only would I recommend this company, but I’d also recommend these earphones :) thanks so much!..I really like them, but the earphone part sticks out just a little too much for me to love them. I wish it the design was a little smaller. it makes my already big head, look huge. but sound quality is great, and battery life is amazing",0
3.0,Very good with minor but annoying flaw,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"Very good quality, comfortable and quite long battery, but here is an irritating hum noise...Update:..The company was really kind to offer a refund or send another model. They sent me another model and it works much better than this one...Appreciate it!",0
5.0,Nice!,"March 4, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. They are just what i wanted and needed. They sound great, fit great, and are easy to use. I love that you can adjust the volume and change songs from the headset. I haven't used the call features yet, so i cannot comment on that, but overall I do love the headset! And they were more than affordable :)",0
5.0,Good sound quality!,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"I just received these yesterday and so far,  I really like these headphones. They are very comfortable. Outside noise is muffled, and the sound quality, for the price is pretty decent. I'm thinking about purchasing another pair for myself, since I got the first pair for my son.",0
1.0,Headphones don’t last !,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"So the headphones was working perfectly! I got it Jan 21st 2018 and I was using it for for a about a couple of weeks and then stopped for like two months until recently, I wanted to start back using them again. So obviously, I haven’t used it in so long so I charge it for like two hrs. I wanted to use it and it just wasn’t working. So I let it sit and charge for a day to see if that would work and still no luck. I emailed the company last Sunday and haven’t gotten a response. I’m quite disappointed for the simple fact I really loved these but it didn’t last long. Oh well, you get what you pay for. I will not be buying anything from this place again.",0
1.0,GET HESH 3 (SKULLCANDY) A GREAT SUBSTITUTE TIL U CAN BUY THOSE KLIPSCH...,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"Not loud at all. Sound is muffled. No sound separation. Base is so muddy. (worse than Bose)  Buttons did not work...no Fwd, no pause, no play etc etc. G. A R. B. A. G. E.",1
1.0,Lasted 3 months,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"These have great features and work wonderfully, but the construction of the control buttons is really cheap.  After 3 months the power button stopped clicking and they won't power off.",1
3.0,Works great for listening to music.,"April 10, 2018",Yes,"Works great for listening to music, but I can only give it three stars since the audio quality drops significantly when you use the mic such as Skype, Facetime, or use with a PC for gaming. It then sounds like a really cheap mono speaker. The sound quality is great otherwise, very loud and clear.",0
5.0,"Yes, Yes, Yes... AMAZING!!","September 19, 2018",Yes,"I love love love these.  They hold a charge, cut out noise, and work great.  They connected to my iPhone easy, without any issues.  I use these for walking, outside.  My cousin uses them in the gym.  They are amazing!!",0
4.0,Comfortable and quality sound for price,"December 3, 2017",Yes,These are a great buy for the money.  Sound is not beats or Bose but great for everyday activities.  I spend hours using headphones daily and these have proved comfortable and so far durable and for a guy who has to routinely replace headphone cords these have been great for the relatively short time I’ve had them.,0
5.0,Best headphones for the best price,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are amazing! Bought them as a gift for my guy and he loves them. He also has a pair of Beats by Dre and says that he prefers these over the beats. I tried them out and I love the fit. They fit perfectly over your whole ear and seal nicely for sound proofing. Very happy I purchased these, may even order another pair for myself.",0
5.0,LOVE everything about these headphones,"July 14, 2018",Yes,"LOVE everything about these headphones! Great sound, super comfy, good noise reduction! Wonderful company sent me another pair after I received a defective set and gave a less than satisfied review. I was so happy to receive the replacement!! These are the most comfy headphones EVER!",0
5.0,Wireless headphones that are easy to use!!,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"This was a great purchase, I got three of them for my children. They work great, easy to charge, easy to Bluetooth to my children's kindles.  The sound is great and we had them on the plane and they did a great job blocking out other noises.  I then had to go back and purchase me one.  I love that they come in many colors so each kid knows their head set.  I also was able to link to the kids Chromebooks for school.  I would recommend these wireless headphones to anyone and have recommended them to a friend.",0
4.0,Very comfortable head gear,"November 20, 2017",Yes,Love the head phones. Sound is what you expect based on price. So far they last as adveritices. The only problem I would say (which is why I gave 3 stars and not more) are the buttons to navigate. No very responsive unless you hit them dead center. Giving it a 4 star based on extremely great customer service.,0
1.0,DON'T BUY,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"Don't buy. The buttons don't work. When I'm able to turn it on, it says ""Power on, phone 1 connected."" Then 10 seconds later goes ""Powering, your headset is disconnected, power off"" And just repeats this process until the headphones die. Also, sound quality is weird, there's a high pitched frequency that makes you feel like your ears are being boxed in. They worked until about 2 weeks ago and, shocker, now I'm past the return date. BULL.",5
5.0,Great headphones for the price,"December 6, 2017",Yes,"Great quality for the price.  Audio is clear and it has a very impressive battery life.  I can go several days without charging with moderate use..Occasionally, the audio has had bluetooth playback issues, but restarting the headphones has always resolved that for me, taking only 10-20 seconds.  The only serious issue in 4.5 months of ownership was that it recently stopped pairing with my devices and wouldn't go into pairing mode at all.  Luckily, this resolved itself within a day so I didn't have to contact their customer support &amp; it's working very well now...Regardless of the few issues I've had, I'd still rate the headphones as 5/5 as there isn't any better quality for the value.",0
5.0,So comfortable!,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"These headphones fit comfortably on both my husband and I. I bought them so my husband can play video games while our kids are sleeping. It paired easily with his PS3. Unfortunately after lots of googling we found out the PS3 is not made to play game sound via Bluetooth, only chat. We kept them to use on our iPad and phone. Glad we bought these. Very good quality for the price.",0
5.0,Good bluetooth headphones at a reasonable price,"November 17, 2017",Yes,These are good headphones to pair with a TV that has blue-tooth  The sound quality is very good and they are good to use when one person is watching TV and doesn't want to disturb others in the vicinity.  The price is very reasonable for these headphones and are a number one seller on Amazon.,0
4.0,No sound after only two months of usage.,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"Purchased for my son, he loved it until it stopped working. Only had it for less than 2 months. Not worth the money...Updated review: After I posted this review, the company contacted me and apologized about the failure of their product and mailed me a new one without asking! That’s customer service! My son was thrilled and has been using it pretty much everyday and so far it’s working great! I upped my rating to four stars.",0
4.0,Works as described and really comfortable to wear for long periods of time,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"Works as described and really comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It does have some connection issues when I switch between connecting them to my phone or my tv and sometimes I have to go through the pairing process twice before it takes. But if you're not switching between devices, it works great!",0
5.0,Very good headphones,"April 1, 2018",Yes,I was looking for some type of wireless headphone for PC gaming. These really sound good and are very comfortable for hours worth of gaming on one charge. Quality is top notch. I would buy them again. Jury is still out as to how long the battery will last though.,0
2.0,Wouldn’t even get them again if they were free.,"October 17, 2018",Yes,"The video reviews are all false. The sound quality is by far the worst I’ve heard from any studio headphones EVER. It’s like someone stuffed paper inside and then you put it over your ears. It’s muffed, lower than low quality, and not a very good experience. I’d say only get these if you’re deaf and want to wear them as a fashion statement (because they look cool and have a great build quality) or you have some kids that would never be able to take care of quality headphones. But PLEASE don’t get these for music...or anything else.",0
5.0,Great full sound. Comparable to Beats at a fraction of the price!,"June 4, 2018",Yes,"Overall, for the price, I don’t think these headphones can be beat. I have listened  to lots of different ones in stores such as Bose, beats, monster, Sony, etc. and I really don’t think they sound much better than these do if at all. The stay on the head very nicely. I use them to work out. even when I jump up and down , They stay on. Very happy with the money I spent on these. I highly recommend!",0
4.0,Solid headphones for the price.,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"Got these for work. Construction is very sturdy. Sound is exceptional, especially for this price. I think these phones work best with certain types of devices, maybe those that can provide more power. The bass was very underwhelming until I found a good USB-&gt;3.5mm connector. Now these things put out more bass than any others i've owned. You might even need to equalize it down...Only negative is they are a little bit tight, and I don't have a large head. If your head is big, best to avoid these.",0
5.0,Better than expected.,"November 11, 2018",Yes,"For the price I didn’t expect much... I was wrong. Solid sound quality, great sizing adjustments (fits my 7 year old daughter just as well as my 39 years old head), folds well for travel, durable, and very comfortable to wear.",0
4.0,Good sound quality,"July 11, 2018",Yes,"Good sound quality, super comfortable, great battery life.  My 1st pair I bought in August of 2017, and they crapped out in July 2018.  It might be a fluke - they power up just fine, but won't pair with any device.  Probably going to buy another set and hope this is just a defect...(Has the Bluetooth fail happened to anyone else?)..EDIT:  I had to try re-pairing them three times, but finally they found (or were found ) by my iPad.  A little finicky during pairing, but good overall.  +1 star.",0
5.0,I like them! They feel good,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"Really been using these headphones a lot! I like them! They feel good, they hold on my head well when I work out! They stay on when I'm laying flat doing bench press etc, they sound good. Connect right up to my phone and the controls on the side work perfectly! Would like it if these offered a little more bass but over all they function great and sound awesome!",0
5.0,Best Headphones I’ve Purchased,"March 30, 2018",Yes,"After reading all of the reviews, I bought a pair of these headphones. The sound quality is superb. The fit and comfort level are amazing and it actually reduces outside noise. If you are looking for a good set of wireless headphones, you need to get these!",0
5.0,Great Sound. Very comfortable,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"Long battery.  Great Sound.  Very comfortable.  All for a tenth of the price of the ""rhythms by a rapper"" headphones.  Honestly, the quality difference between these and the very expensive headphones is negligible, and you would need audio equipment to truly tell the difference.",0
5.0,Great !!!,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"Works well. I decided to purchase the warranty just  incase. It charges well. My husband says the only thing he doesn't like is; that there isn't any base. If you are using it for phone and headphone. If a call comes through , you will have to go back and re select head phone option.",0
5.0,Great Value Headphones,"January 8, 2018",Yes,These are a great product! I was not sure at first because these were less than $40 and didn’t think they would be good quality. BUT I was wrong. The sound quality and the make is really good! They look really good and are also very comfortable. They hold the charge but you want to power off between uses. If you are looking to hook them up to device like a tv or laptop that doesn’t have Bluetooth you will need to buy the Mpow Bluetooth adapter.,0
4.0,Decent headphones. Great company,"March 6, 2018",Yes,They block out noise well and the sound is good. It should be noted that there are flashing lights while operating that are most obvious in a dark room. I had trouble with the blue tooth and the company promptly sent a replacement. It's nice how they stand by their product.,0
5.0,Great Customer Service,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"Update:  Due to some issues with this product, we were sent a replacement.  So far the replacement works great.  My son was so excited to receive the replacement.  Thank you, so much for the great customer service...Original Post:  Well SHOOT!  My son LOVES these headphones.  LOVES them.  But they just stopped working.  They work fine if they are plugged into a charger, but as soon as you unplug them from the charger, they turn off and will not turn back on.  So disappointed. :(",0
4.0,No problems.  Good product,"November 7, 2017",Yes,"These are great.  The only reason for the four stars is they are pretty snug for me.  But as far as the product is concerned, it is excellent.  I'm not a audiophile so I cannot provide in-depth analysis of sound.  I use them at work and they suit the purpose.  I've had them over five months and no issues.",0
3.0,"Great for music and phone, not so great for gaming","November 2, 2017",Yes,"Great for music and phone, not so great for gaming..Overall a good headset, but know what you are getting with the Bluetooth versions and windows 10. On my Windows 10 machine, I am presented with two audio devices, the headset, which is the mic and mono sound on the headset, and headphones, which is just audio with no mic input. This is great for music on any device and phone calls on the iPhone, but for gaming with voice on PC, I either have to choose between not talking, or being able to chat but having terrible, tinny mono sound...Checked versions and driver on all devices are up to date, so I believe this is something with how windows 10 registers BT recording devices. Just a heads up if you order this headset for PC gaming.",0
5.0,Perfect Choice,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"Love my new headphones! The sound is studio quality with deep bass effects and crisp stereo clear fidelity. These headphones cover my ears just right to block out all ambient noise. They charge quickly and easily connect to my Bluetooth devices. The folding feature makes them compact to carry in the handy soft pouch. I also love the price, wouldn't want to pay too much for a headset.",1
5.0,Over-ear phones and vastly more comfortable to 1st Bluetooth on-ear headphones I ordered,"November 22, 2017",Yes,"Over-ear phones and vastly more comfortable to 1st Bluetooth on-ear headphones I ordered, glowing reviews notwithstanding. Maybe it's my old ears (67).  Controls are intuitive and far easier to manipulate, and sound quality definitely superior. I would say these are the ""headphones at a reasonable price"" to buy.",0
3.0,These headphones are very nice for the price,"March 9, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are very nice for the price. The battery really chugs on, and they're quite comfortable on my head. They look very nice and feel pretty well made..I have to lower my rating because when connected to my pc or laptop, they play fine for a few minutes, and then the audio begins to lag, go on and off, and stretches the audio out into robotic tones. This can be fixed by disconnecting them, but the problem will come back after another few minutes.",1
5.0,Great Gaming Headset,"September 13, 2017",Yes,"This is great for voice chat while gaming. The built-in mic works well and I've had no complaints on the sound quality of my voice when using it. The sound quality coming from the headset is ""good enough"". It's not meant for audiophiles listening to Mozart or anything. It's best for voice chat when gaming.",0
5.0,Really good headphones for the price,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are amazing! I haven't regretted the purchase at all, in fact, I'm quite glad these were my first Bluetooth headset. I use them every day for about 2-4 hours at most and the battery last for about a week and a half, which is awesome. The quality is very good and the volume goes up quite a lot. I have no problem wearing these headphones for hours on end, so they are very comfortable and last but not least the ability to use the headphones wirelessly or with an aux cord is awesome. I'd recommend them to anyone if you are looking for good quality cheap headphones.",0
2.0,Fine for listening but pathetic for making phone calls,"October 8, 2017",Yes,"The sound quality for listening is fine, but the microphone is pathetic and useless for making phone calls. When I tested it by calling my own voice mail, the sound was muffled and most of the message got cut off because it did not meet the system  threshold for recording.",2
1.0,Non-functioning after two and a half months of use.,"December 16, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these in October and they are already nor working. Generally, the headphones say ""Power on; pairing, such and such connected"". Now, despite both of my devices being ready and tested and functioning with other bluetooth devices, these no longer do. They've been charged,..Really hoping I dob't have to track down the boxed paperwork to take advantage of the 12 month warranty.",1
2.0,Defective or just plain bad,"May 6, 2017",Yes,"These were terrible earphones, so much so that I think they must have been defective. he sound was muddy with gravely base compleely overpowering the midrange and higher. One could barely hear the dialog for all the gummy base noise.",1
4.0,Tune Out the World,"October 8, 2018",Yes,"I can't hear a thing except my music when these are on my ears, and it is glorious. The battery life is astounding. I haven't charged them in days. Literal days. My only complaint is sometimes the buttons on it don't communicate/work and sometimes it glitches once or twice before playing my music. But that may be my phone too, I'm not sure. And the sound quality isn't the best I've ever heard. But it has a microphone so with these babies on, I can talk on my phone while being nowhere near it. It is beautiful. It is glorious. Buy these headphones. Buy them.",0
2.0,Not good for working out,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"I intended to use this headphone while working out, but found it to be too heavy and when I would run or jump I would experience a loud thumping sound in the headphone.  This just didn't work for what I wanted.  If I was just sitting, the headphones worked just fine.",0
5.0,These were great for the plane,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"These were great for the plane. The engine was still pretty loud when we sat on the back of the plane, but it tuned it out nicely when we were in the middle. The bluetooth and wired functions both worked well. I'm very pleased with what I got for the price!",0
5.0,Perfect,"February 28, 2018",Yes,I put them on and they’re a perfect fit. They’re very comfortable. Much more comfortable than my previous headphones. I’m glad the last pair broke. The price was okay. The sound quality is good although I have heard better. The headphones can get pretty loud which is nice.,0
5.0,"Awesome headphones for the price - Great design, build, sound, noise isolation","May 26, 2017",Yes,"These headsets are awesome if you're not an audiophile. Got them for my 10yr son and was amazed at the sound and noise isolation. You put them on without playing music and it literally isolates 90% of the noise outside. Once you start playing music, you won't be able to hear any noise around you and the quality of sound is great for the price.",0
5.0,I bought these for my 12 year old daugther and ...,"June 10, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my 12 year old daugther and she loves them.  Anything to keep the music down in the house I am a fan of ;),1
5.0,Mini vacation for mom,"April 8, 2018",Yes,I’m loving these.  For a fraction of the cost of most I get terrific sound quality with Bluetooth cord free convenience.  They work terrifically to block out the noise of bickering kids to give me a small break of a music filled break to regain some sanity.  Just what I needed.,0
3.0,paired it and never would play just sounds like splashing water in headphones,"April 20, 2018",Yes,"Thanks Mpow for your excellent customer service, but unfortunately the headset was still unable to connect to my tv. Maybe if it came with a mpow transmitter or something, I’m still working with them so I will update when all goes well. The headsets are great that’s why I really need this to work for me.",0
5.0,I love these things!,"December 14, 2017",Yes,I wanted a pair of headphones to watch tv while my husband slept. I go these and could be more pleased! I have them paired with my dish for and my kindle. It was easy to pair and has simple controls. I have a big head but the adjust and are comfortable! I love the color too. I wish I had got them a long time ago. I highly recommend them and will by them as presents for others! Oh the do not claim to be noise cancelling but do a check of a job at it.,0
4.0,"Amazing sound quality, but some discomfort","April 26, 2018",Yes,"I struggled whether or not to give these headphones 3 or 4 stars. The sound quality is AMAZING, the foldable style is nice, and the headphones seem sturdy and durable. However, I have had these headphones for a couple months now and I start to feel slight discomfort on the top of my head after only 30 minutes. Then after an hour I have to take them off because the discomfort is much more noticeable. It may just be me because other reviews don't seem to mention this problem. The sound quality is awesome for the price though.",0
5.0,Great product the sound quality is pretty good but they ...,"March 29, 2018",Yes,Great product the sound quality is pretty good but they are extremely comfortable I would definitely recommend these as a budget headphone option,1
3.0,"which is good, because the last pair (elegiant brand) broke after ...","July 30, 2018",Yes,"This is not a negative review. If I could I'd give it a 3.5. These feel much sturdier than my last pair, which is good, because the last pair (elegiant brand) broke after about half a year. However the audio quality with these is not as good. The sound is crisp, but lacks fullness and bass, leaving it feeling a little tinny. Not bad, just not great. My last cheap pair of headphones accustomed me to better, but for the price I am still satisfied. Hope these last longer.",0
4.0,"Good product, well worth the money. Sound ok.","September 1, 2017",Yes,"Good product with outstanding battery capacity (weeks without charging with daily use). The folding parts are very convenient for storage and travel...Product feels and looks a bit cheap. The sounds is ok but not stunning, it lacks a bit of depth and dynamic. It's still well worth the money and perfect a daily use, for my commute or outdoor stuff.",0
5.0,Now hear this!,"June 24, 2017",Yes,Awesome! Charged it up and everything works great. A little on the bass side for me but overall an A+. Remember what they cost! There's even an instruction booklet with it but easier to watch on utube reviews. The spouse can watch/listen to political junkie stuff while I float down a stream with my Mpow headphones on the same couch.,0
5.0,Wish they lasted longer(revised),"June 21, 2018",Yes,Had these headphones for less than a month and while wearing them they got extremely hot on one side and shut off never to work again. I loved them and this company I am beyond disappointed. This was my intial review I would like to update by simply saying that this company has gone out of there way to resend me new head phones for free. This is amazing customer service and that alone makes them 5 Star in my book.,1
5.0,"Another satisfied customer  Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear, Hi-Fi...","March 4, 2017",Yes,The headphones are great love them also the phone feature is a huge plus I really like that part and works perfectly I have used them to make calls and the sound is very good on both ends of the conversation I had doubts about the microphone but it seams to work very well even though it is  hidden in the headset itself..Nice product and comfortable to wear.,0
3.0,Nice sound and work fine but too heavy.,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"I find these a little too heavy and they give me headaches after awhile. Sound is good.  Wireless is a great feature, very convenient for use when working outside or inside vacuuming.  Pairs easily with my iPhone SE.  Look nice.  Just wish they didn't give me headaches.",0
5.0,Great for sensitive ears!,"May 10, 2018",Yes,"Fantastic headphones. Great for over the ears! My ears are super sensitive and I have several piercings, so in-ear buds and headsets that sit on the ear become uncomfortable and give me a headache quickly. Bonus, ASMR sounds great on this headset as well!",0
3.0,"Okay sound, annoying voice","May 14, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality is fine, but every time you turn it on, connect/disconnect to your device, mute, and power it off there is the loudest voice possible telling you all of that. No option I can see to turn it down, super annoying. Sucks when trying to turn them on in a quiet area and it blasts ""POWER ON"" as loud as can be.",1
5.0,Very Good Headphones,"December 2, 2017",Yes,"I was looking for some inexpensive over the ear Bluetooth headphones for travel purposes. I have had them now for roughly 2 months and probably 75 hours of use while on the plane. Very comfortable on the ears, good sound, loud enough to be heard over engine noise and long lasting while in Bluetooth mode.",0
5.0,What I wanted!,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"My last ones brokedown and wear and tear for so long, and I've always wanted a bluetooth headset for a while now, so early christmas foe me cuz this headset is everything I wanted , especially the colors.",0
5.0,Great value!!,"November 15, 2017",Yes,These head phones are perfect for my travel use. Even though they dont noise cancel they block most of the surrounding noise perfectly. No more volume issues when plugged into aircraft media. Absolutely worth the money. Great value. I will be buying these for everyone for Christmas. Highly recommend.,0
5.0,"They're comfortable, the sound quality is great for the price","January 11, 2018",Yes,"I have been hunting for affordable, decent headphones and I'm rather picky. These fit all my criteria. They're comfortable, the sound quality is great for the price, they connect wonderfully to my MacBook and iPhone. I will admit the bass isn't as strong in these as I'd prefer, but that's the only thing I have to complain about. Even better, I have stretched ears which makes finding comfortable over the ear headphones incredibly hard. These headphones fit my lobes perfectly. They don't go inside the pad entirely given they're 5/8 of an inch, but the padding is soft against my ears. Excellent purchase.",0
5.0,Good product for price.,"March 5, 2018",Yes,"Mpow 59 Bluetooth headphones easily paired with my phone. They seem to be well-made, and I'm hoping to use them until they are obsolete. The maximum volume is not extremely loud, which is probably a good thing for hearing safety. I think the sound quality is quite good, although this is my first set of noise-cancelling headphones, therefore I can't make any comparisons. All in all, I'm very pleased with these headphones.",0
5.0,Great Quality,"November 30, 2018",Yes,My son is rough on headphones. Drops them and the poor cords.....  I got these and the fit and sound is great. The cord to charge the headphones doesnt quite fit but I had another cord that was able to the job. Worth it for the price. Durable enough to withstand my 8 yr old.,0
1.0,Get the Tao Tronics,"April 11, 2018",Yes,Tested and dude(tte)... SPEND THE EXTRA ON THE TAOTRONICS!!..https://www.amazon.com/TaoTronics-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones-Noise-Cancelling/dp/B075CBHN9M/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523470963&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=taotronics+bluetooth+headphones,0
5.0,Very impressed,"April 21, 2018",Yes,"Very impressed with this buy. I got it for traveling and work, and it works beautifully. It’s easy to pair with my phone and my computer. I used it a whole week on and off without having to recharge. Used it on the plane, and found it has the added benefit of being a comfy head rest to boot!",1
5.0,Great headphones for a workout - volume is better than most,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"Nice headphones for the price. Key feature is that they have an amplifier built in which enables them to go louder that standard BT headphones. No, you won’t get Bose audiophile quality, but you will save $300+ and have a decent setup for your workout",0
5.0,Five Stars,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"I love these headphones. So many reviews and when I started reading the 1 star reviews because I couldn't believe this product was 1 star, it seems that I don't have any of those problems. It sounds awesome, connects easily, it holds an awesome charge. I have used it for days without charging it. Just follow instructions on how to use it and it is a breeze.",0
5.0,Great headphones. My bf took my last pair so ...,"August 9, 2018",Yes,Great headphones. My bf took my last pair so I bought a pair in pink to deter him from wearing them. I must say that the sound quality is great and the battery life is amazing. Also I love that it comes with a little carrying bag.,0
5.0,Pleasantly surprised at how awesome these are,"July 28, 2017",Yes,Wow!!! Pleasantly surprised at how awesome these are!! Excellent sound- easy charging- were perfect for the gym- never sslipped- the cushioning on ears and head area made for great comfort! Fold and ready to go!,1
3.0,Battery is good sound is not,"September 3, 2018",Yes,They are comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours and the battery hasn’t died on my yet after hours of use. But they are fairly quite and other people can hear everything that comes out of them. So I would suggest really only to use them in your own home.,0
4.0,Good sound at a good price,"August 18, 2018",Yes,"I bought these to wear exclusively at the gym because I hated having my headphones cable get tied up in knots or catch on stuff. These sound really good for the price ($40 at the time of purchase). My only issue with these is that they're a tad bulky. There may be a reason for it, but it just looks a little weird. If you can get over that, I'd suggest picking these up.",0
5.0,For less than $40.00 these headphones REALLY deliver!!,"January 3, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphone over a month ago.  I liked that they looked like BEATS headphones, but was skeptical about the price.  I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES!!  Very impressed.  They sound great.  They come with so many accessories.  You can use them wired, you can you them bluetooth.  They come with a felt carrying bag. All this for less than $30.00.  I don't think anyone can go wrong with these headphones.  Also, very comfortable.  I don't see this happening, but if they wear out, I would happily buy these headphones again!!",0
5.0,"Comfortable, good quality for the price.","November 10, 2018",Yes,"My stepdaughter turned me on to these noise-cancelling headphones.  There is only one work to describe them: superb!  The headphones fit comfortably on my head.  The sound quality is excellent, and the controls are easy to use.  I can connect to two devices, which is very convenient.  Finally, the headphones hold a charge for a long time...A good buy.",0
5.0,They're great for the price,"April 21, 2018",Yes,"They're great for the price. Good audio quality. Super comfortable (I wear them all day at work)..Buuuut, I wish that when they were running out of power they didn't just beep in your ear every five seconds. Just let us know once..Pause the music or podcast, say ""You're battery is at 5%."" Then play the music and just die after power runs out..Seriously, beeping at me for 30 full minutes gets old fast.",0
1.0,not happy with it,"December 18, 2017",Yes,"Cannot change the volume and tried all the options other purchasers suggested ...and always needs charged ... not happy with it ... the instructions are worthless and, being honest, aren’t really much but a couple of inefficient lines.",1
3.0,It's okay,"October 21, 2017",Yes,"The sound quality's okay compared to other headphones I've had. It is also pretty tight around the ear which isn't too annoying but can be when you wear them for a while but yeah, these headphones are honestly just okay, nothing too special (besides the features, which aren't too bad), but if you're gonna use them for just listening to music or anything like that, I'd recommend getting a different pair of headphones.",1
4.0,It's cheap so I was not expecting the best quality but the quality is actually pretty good,"May 16, 2017",Yes,It's cheap so I was not expecting the best quality but the quality is actually pretty good. I have a pair of Sennheisers as well and although the comparison may not be fair I will say this- the bass is really deep in these headphones compared with the Sennheisers BUT at a cost to the overall sound quality. The controls at the side are a pleasant touch and the cans are comfortable but not for too long because they can begin to crush your lobes after long usage. I've used them at the gym so the BT came in handy and was pretty good. I'd buy again if I needed another budget pair but they won't replace your over-expensive brands.,0
5.0,Broke after 3 months of use,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"Updated May 2018: gotta give credit where it's due. Seller rectified the situation and the three stars is for the service level. Going to have to update down the road on the longevity of these headphones.. Bought these around Christmas time and took very good care of them. Now after 4 months the speaker in one of the ears is dead, leaving sound only through one side. You get what you pay for I guess, but the reviews seems so promising. These headphones suck, don't buy them.",0
3.0,"This has been a fantastic headset, unfortunately the only issue I'm having is ...","October 2, 2017",Yes,"This has been a fantastic headset, unfortunately the only issue I'm having is that even with resizing, the plastic has cracked on both sides at the joints. I still use the headset, has fantastic battery life, good audio quality, though the mic can be a bit off sometimes...For the price, it is a good headset good. Would be 5 stars if the plastic wasn't so easily broken.",0
5.0,Fantastic Sound Quality,"August 6, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these headphones are fantastic. I have a pair of beats studio3 wireless headphones that I use at work, and ordered these for use at home (so I don't have to drag my beats back and forth every day). The sound quality on these is literally about the same as the beats. The beats are a little better, and do have the active noise cancellation, but they also cost almost 10x as much. These seem to be a bit more comfortable than the beats. If you're looking for great sound at an affordable price, these headphones knock it out of the park.",0
3.0,The sound quality is great. Except that it's really tight sometimes and can ...,"April 4, 2018",Yes,The sound quality is great. Except that it's really tight sometimes and can feel like it's squeezing my ears and then gives me a headache. Maybe it's made for a kid's size head. But sound quality is great and hooked up to my bluetooth devices no problems.,0
4.0,Great sound quality,"October 22, 2017",Yes,"Great sound quality, good bass. basically noise cancelation, blocks out a lot of outside noise. the ear pads are large and fit around your whole ear rather than pushing against your cartilage. Ears sweat after a little while but thats to be expected as the are essentially ear muffs. They have a snug fit so you can even run while wearing them.",0
5.0,Excellent value!,"July 12, 2017",Yes,"Excellent value! These earphones have great sound quality, they paired quickly with my phone with no problems, and they're really comfortable. The battery lasts a long time as well which is helpful since they get used all the time. These are a fantastic option if you want wireless headphones and don't want to spend a ton of money.",0
5.0,these are pretty awesome! i had given a wireless pair from ...,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"wow, these are pretty awesome!.i had given a wireless pair from another brand to my boyfriend a couple years ago..he used it so much the poor thing collapsed..decided to order a new one and found this. i was afraid it would not be better or equal in quality from his old set, but when it arrived I was surprised. it is beautiful, fits very comfortably and the sound is pretty good. so much better than the previous one. lets see how long it will last!",0
2.0,Ehhhhhhh...Negative GhostRider,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"I liked the color and convenience of the earphones, however they were sort of heavy for my head and squeezed pretty tight on my ears. I have small ears, so I don't know why they hurt me so bad. The fact that I could hear my boyfriend's conversations when he was talking on the phone while my music was playing was a turn off. The microphone wasn't very good either. People kept saying that they couldn't hear me..I sent them back. Decided to find something better!",1
5.0,These headphones are the bomb!,"November 16, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are what I’ve been looking for.  So happy i ordered two of them.  The sound quality is amazing, especially for the price.  I’m so happy i ordered two, one for when I’m using and the other to be charged up and ready when i need it.  My music sounds unbelievable with these headphones.  Nothing else to say.",0
5.0,Very happy with the quality so far of these headphones,"January 14, 2018",Yes,"Very happy with the quality so far of these headphones, especially for the price.  Sound quality is good and for the price, I didn't / don't expect quality to be equal to Bose or other higher quality perhaps, headphones.  Personal choice of course, but for my needs and budget, rather than $300 plus, these meet my needs.  As with all things, there are times and needs of individuals for different requirements, but again, matter of choice.  Overall, good quality and sound.",0
5.0,Best Bluetooth headphones I’ve had,"January 24, 2018",Yes,I have tried sooooo many Bluetooth headphones and nothing even compares to these. I swear by them. No they’re not noise cancelljng but it really doesn’t matter! They’re perfect. I use them everyday to workout and they really get me i the zone! I love these and highly recommend them.,0
4.0,Great Value with even better sound / bass,"January 7, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this as a gift for my son. I couldn’t imagine spending money on Beats so was searching for an alternative. After reading the reviews, I decided to give these a try. I was hesitant still that the quality would not be good. However, after receiving the package and connecting the Headphones, My son was happy with the sound quality and the Bass. He is happy with this product and that’s all I could ask for. Con: The Headphones are adjustable, but the fit still is not right.",0
5.0,Great headphones for the $,"March 15, 2018",Yes,"Very good headphones for the price. Very comfortable; can be worn for extended periods. Compared to my Bose, just a tiny bit hollow sounding. Still, I am taking only these on my trip to Europe for the long flights and half dozen 2+ hour train rides. Solidly constructed.",0
3.0,Two Stars,"January 21, 2018",Yes,"I bought the first pair for my autistic sister who loves music. They would only connect to a phone. I returned them. Mpow  emailed an apology and at another pair. Free of charge. If nothing else, they have great customer service. As far as I know they can connect to other things.",0
5.0,Great product and super price.,"March 5, 2018",Yes,I've had this for a few weeks but just today used it for the first time. I really like it. It's very comfortable and easy to operate. The Bluetooth was easy to sync to my Fire tablet. The fit is good and blocks almost all outside noise...well except for my sister's voice!,0
4.0,Love the design,"October 18, 2017",Yes,Love the design. Very comfortable. Cheap..Don't like the sound. Functions properly but Doesn't play loud enough for me. Is in stereo while I like base. When connected to my laptop the sound is terrible and it keeps disconnecting.Works good with my phone but not with my laptop. Will give it away...Gave it to my brother after trying out for 1 day. He's very much in love with it and it connects much better to his laptop.,0
5.0,Good product for the money,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"Good product for the money. Bose brand can be upward of 300 dollars but these sound just fine to me. Within an hour after delivery, I was charged, connected via bluetooth with my phone and walking around town. I go for 1- 2 hour walks 3 times a week and have found these comfortable and easy to use. The manual volume controls and skip function on the earpiece are a nice feature, When a phone call came in, the music stopped automatically and took the call. Speaking at a normal tone, the other person could hear me just fine. I can see why this product is an Amazon bestseller.",0
5.0,Best headphones ever!,"May 29, 2018",Yes,I absolutely am in love with these headphones!!! They are noise canceling which is what I need and I love that’s it’s bluetooth/wired! Really glad I got these!!,1
5.0,Must have,"April 24, 2018",Yes,Bought these earphones to pair with a Bluetooth transmitter for my tv. A slight hearing impairment caused excessive volume in my apartment and to keep peace with the neighbors I made this purchase. Now I can hear the tv and my neighbors cannot.,0
5.0,Great quality headphones for a really good price,"July 31, 2017",Yes,"Great quality headphones for a really good price. Highly recommend if ur in the market for a new pair of wireless/wired headsets. Also the plug part that goes into ur phone is super narrow, I usually have to take my case off to plug headphones in, but I don't need to do that with these, just plugs right in and I'm ready to listen to music or watch a video. Highly recommend",0
5.0,The battery life is also amazing. The build quality is good,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"You can’t beat the sound quality for the money.  The battery life is also amazing.  The build quality is good, and best of all it fits my big head.  Many headphones squeeze my head too hard that it begins to hurt and become uncomfortable.  Not these.  I’m very satisfied with these headphones.",0
5.0,... only used this 2 times and so far so good. At first,"April 7, 2018",Yes,"I've only used this 2 times and so far so good. At first,  the headphones seemed a little tight  and heavy but I got used to it very quickly. Until now I have been using earbuds so it is a big difference in weight but I found the buds to be quite annoying and they kept falling out. Anyway, for the price, the sound is fine and it actually does cancel the surrounding noise.  I would certainly recommend these",0
5.0,Good deal - Updated review,"October 19, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these as a gift. They arrived on time and as described. They appear to be well made and they fold down and fit well in the carrying bag that is included in the box. I have not tested them as they are intended to be a gift, however I am very tempted to purchase a set for myself...Update - I spoke with the recipient of these headphones and they could not be more pleased. They state that the sound quality is better than their wired Beats brand headphones.",0
5.0,For some reason the blue tooth part of this will ...,"May 6, 2018",Yes,For some reason the blue tooth part of this will not connect to my phone. I have tried everything. It's the main reason I bought this was to connect to my phone. I just plug it in and use it. But it does block a lot of outside sound so all it forgiven.,0
1.0,"Cumbersome, aggressive, crackly, and all around crap.","July 31, 2018",Yes,"I’ve had these for about three and a half months, and I’m quite disappointed, especially with how highly rated they are here. Cumbersome, and tight around my head, I often get headaches wearing them for more than about an hour. The on and off is overly aggressive, with a woman screaming at you about powering on or off. And you have to hold the power button down for what feels like AGES...Most importantly, quite often while using them, they get crackly or just cut out completely. When the connection is good, the sound quality is okay...Poor quality. Poor design. Not worth it.",0
3.0,Beware of Bluetooth pairing,"March 1, 2018",Yes,I've had the headphones for just under a month and have had to pair them at least 7 times.  My other Bluetooth. Speakers and headsets all work fine. Pain In the butt! Good sound and comfy fit otherwise. Ive got 4 days to return them but don t have the box they came in. Ugh,0
4.0,Good price,"June 22, 2018",Yes,"Good for the price. The sound quality isn't great over bluetooth, but you can understand everything just fine if it's only spoken. If you're listening to music, I'd recommend using the cord. That also doesn't draw the battery on this device.",0
5.0,They are easy to use,"October 3, 2017",Yes,"This is actually the second pair of these I've bought, because the first pair worked so well my brother decided he couldn't live without a pair as well. They are easy to use, comfortable over my small ears, and the battery lasts quite a while. The only downside is that when you move more than a room or so away from your phone it starts to cut out, but since my phone is almost always in my pocket anyway, it's not a huge deal to me.",0
3.0,Not as picture appears. Don’t buy if you’re counting on that.,"October 3, 2018",Yes,"The fit of these is generous and the sound and battery are fine. However I paid more for the pink ones and they’re hideous. They don’t look like the pictures. The pink is that awful peach pink you find in your grandmother’s bathroom because it’s been there for fifty years. I realize this is a petty thing to be unhappy about, but considering I paid an extra five dollars for it, I think it should at least look like promised.",0
5.0,Comfortable. Great sound. Great Customer Experience,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"Not noise-cancelling, but comfortable...UPDATE: I had issues with this headset when I updated my Mac to the mojave OS. It was only playing sound in the left ear. When I reconnected to other devices like my google pixel, all was fine. I reached out to customer service and they promptly got back to me, addressed I had an issue and sent me a replacement headset, once I returned the defective item. The replacement headset works perfectly! Thanks a bunch!",0
1.0,Stopped working after few months,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"Headphones completely stopped working after light use for few months . Save your money.  I tried everything to charge it to connect it directly with the cable nothing worked. I purchased two , one for myself and one for my son happened with both",0
5.0,Bose is in trouble,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"I am in love. The design is good, the ear muffs are as comfortable as ones from Bose (in my opinion), you can use these without worrying about the battery if you attach the detachable cord, charging is done over the standard micro USB (no need to carry yet another cable around), and the sound is great.",0
5.0,I must say I love this product,"May 28, 2018",Yes,"I must say I love this product, the price is right very high quality in sound, durable and sustains hard workout sweats! Love love love!!!",1
5.0,Excellet Quality at a Reasonable Price,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"Excellent sound quality and ambient noise cancelling are the two best features of these headphones.  Lightweight, colorful, and foldable are three additional benefits.  These are well-priced and well made.  I would definitely shop here again!",0
4.0,I love to work out and music motivates me I never ...,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"Value for money. This is my first over the head headset. I have tried all the others and it never worked out. I love to work out and music motivates me I never go to the gym without my Mpow. I have used it on at least 4 different occasions so far for at least 90 minutes and I have not had to recharge it. The headset is sturdy, fits well and beautifully made. The sound quality is excellent for the price. My only peeve is that the bass could be a bit deeper and powerful. Overall for the price it is one of my best purchases on amazon yet!",0
5.0,These look and work great!,"April 10, 2018",Yes,These headphones work fabulously! I have taken on several long flights and the charge has held up nicely. Sound quality is great and I love that I can use via Bluetooth or can plug in to source. This is especially helpful on flights with personal tv’s. These are top notch at a great price.,0
5.0,I would recommend this for a economic alternative to the big name ...,"July 27, 2018",Yes,I purchased this item primarily for gym usage.  They perform flawlessly and for the price you cannot beat it compared to other manufacturers.  I would recommend this for a economic alternative to the big name brands.,0
5.0,Awesome headphone Ive had it for 7 month and it's ...,"April 27, 2018",Yes,Awesome headphone Ive had it for 7 month and it's still working like new never had headphone last this long I tend to beat them up I paint for a living this headphone been drop alot and gets full of paint everyday sound quality is awesome nice base,2
5.0,So Far So Good,"August 20, 2018",Yes,"Just received these new headphones and love them so far; Very easy to connect, very comfortable, light weight; great sound, but so far only used for hypnosis tracks. Am ordering a second pair for my girlfriend.",0
5.0,Good budget headphones,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"They're a very good budget headphone. You won't get the sound quality of Bose's or Bowers and Wilkins. However, you'll get decent quality sound for the price. For a 35$ headphone, you cannot beat what you're getting for it. They have decent mids, highs, and bass. Also, the Bluetooth range was quite impressive. Overall, I'd recommend these headphones to anyone that just needs a decent quality headphone for cheap.",0
1.0,"Useless after 6 months, wont charge!","May 3, 2018",Yes,"It worked great, but then all of a sudden it stopped charging. Even after using multiple cords, chargers and outlets. I'm exceedingly frustrated. I've had it for 6 months. I used to be a big MPOW advocate. I will never buy one of their products again.",1
5.0,I like that the sound is good,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"I  like that the sound is good and they look good and feel good on.  i have a large hat size and they are very comfortable.  Changed my review based on the fact that I do not need to reconnect to blue tooth every time I start it, it remains connected. This is great news to me!!!. Gsry",0
5.0,The best quality for a lower price,"October 1, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that they are big and bulky, but they have superior sound quality. I have had Beats headphones and these are a much better quality for a fraction of the price. I definitely recommend these headphones.",0
5.0,I like them,"February 11, 2018",Yes,"I like these.  Just wanted a functional, affordable pair of wireless headphones that a almost 50 year old guy can use at the gym.  Very satisfied with them as they are higher quality than i anticipated in terms of noise cancelling.  They have about a 30 ft range and have worked well in the few months i have had them.  Also bought my son (20) a pair for his birthday and he likes them for when he is practicing his drums.",0
5.0,Blocks outside noise,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"So far so good.  Haven’t had them long but work as advertised.  Good sound, blocks outside noise, a little heavy for my head...I have to adjust the top band every now and then if I’m wearing it for a long time.",0
5.0,Love 'em.,"August 13, 2018",Yes,"Bought for my 14 year old. He said they have great sound and the bass is nice. Bluetooth has good distance. Blocks out a lot of noise when listening to music. Battery life is excellent. And he said they feel sturdy, not cheap.",0
5.0,I am shocked at the excellent sound quality,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"I am shocked at the excellent sound quality, comfort, and general feel of these headphones.  Excellent quality, well made.  I didn't expect much because of the price.  Turns out they are better than my husband's $180 pair.  VERY good, I highly recommend them",0
4.0,Would they be good headphones for $300,"September 25, 2018",Yes,"Would they be good headphones for $300? No, the sound is a little grainy, they feel plasticky, and they are a little tight. Are they amazing for the price? Yes.",1
5.0,Bluetooth Headphones,"June 5, 2018",Yes,"Seems very good value for money, I am no expert in sound, but, I can hear very clearly, they are very comfortable, they are easy to pair with my phone and my TV and the battery lasts a long time, all in all a very good purchase",0
3.0,I was initially very pleased with these headphones,"February 9, 2018",Yes,"I was initially very pleased with these headphones. The charge on them lasted me for a few days. That original charge finally wore down and I charged them again. The next time I used them it said there was only 3/4 battery life on them. Now I’m lucky to get 4 hours of life off them after they have been charged. I’ve had these since December 28th, 2017, so just over a month! Very disappointed!!!",0
5.0,every happy.,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"I had bought the first pair as a gift, I've since purchased three more pairs and I couldn't be happier. The sound is fantastic and trust me, I'm very picky about sound. I know I've purchased a pair of headphones that I will love forever. And I'm giving them as gifts so thank you.",0
5.0,Better than I expected!,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"I was a bit paranoid about ordering headphones online... I usually try the sound out in a store, but these when they came in were in the box, untouched and the Bluetooth function works wonders on my phone! They rest a lot more comfortably than my dying Skullcandy headphones and use the same cord even! For those of you wanting something really comfortable, easy to use and decently priced; I'd reccomend it!",0
1.0,Hi. Yesterday I got the foldable bluetooth headset model ...,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"Hi..Yesterday I got the foldable bluetooth headset model BH059A..I left them charging overnight. I wanted to use them now and they don’t work..they pair with my macbook air but no sound is coming out..I plugged the cable from the headset to my laptop and it works..Why can’t i hear a sound?.Do I have to return them?.I am currently in Orlando, but I don’t live in the US..I am leaving next Tuesday (march 20th)..Please let me know what to do. This is very disappointing..Thank you",0
2.0,Started shorting out at 2 months,"March 10, 2018",Yes,I've only had these just under 2 months and they started shorting out and making static noises every minute or two. It's quite annoying! I like them a lot up until then.,1
4.0,Sound quality is decent enough - service is great!,"March 10, 2018",Yes,"Headphones are ""heavy"", and comfortable - like a beats or something. Sound quality was pretty good - customer service was EXCELLENT and VERY responsive!",1
5.0,These are great. Comfortable,"November 19, 2017",Yes,"These are great.  Comfortable.  I am not an audiophile, but I think they sound good and the ear padding provides a nice quiet environment for me when I wear them working out at the gym.  Love that they come with a cord in case I run out of battery.  Overall great product for the price.",0
5.0,Good sound!,"November 26, 2018",Yes,The sound quality was better than expected! And someone sitting next to me can barely hear the music. My only frustration is the port for charging it does not perfectly fit and it feels like you have to fight with it to get it in right...,0
4.0,These are very good headphones for the price,"August 10, 2017",Yes,"These are very good headphones for the price. I looked at other more expensive ones but decided to try these. Glad I did. The provide very good sound quality, fit well and recharge quickly. While they are heavier than those that plug into the ear the weight is not excessive. When the weather is hot one needs to periodically wipe away the sweat Florida summer heat generates. Cooler weather is probably the only remedy for that. Overall a good product for a good price. I would recommend to friends and others seeking affordable quality headphones.",0
5.0,Love these!,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"I wear them to work out every day, as well as when I am cooking or doing chores. The sound quality is great, and they are very comfortable. The battery life is impressive. They stay on my head even when I am doing yoga or sit ups. Don't hesitate. Get them!",0
5.0,Yes!  Bought this to replace a cheaper one that had problems with the headband.  The cheaper one broke.  This one is much,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"Yes!  Bought this to replace a cheaper one that had problems with the headband.  The cheaper one broke.  This one is much more comfortable (over the ears and also across the head), has MUCH better sound, and is generally an upgrade from the one we purchased before.  Recommended!",0
3.0,The headphones are great in general,"March 5, 2018",Yes,"The headphones are great in general, but when in operation there's an incredibly bright LED that flashes every few seconds. It's incredibly annoying at night, and just a poor feature since you can already tell when the headphones are working by, you know, the audio they're playing. Manufacturer gives no option to disable the light, which I feel is a poor user experience.",0
4.0,All Things considered. I smart buy that I am happy with.,"December 7, 2017",Yes,"I have had a few experiences with these BT phones. These are better than I expected. I have bought a second pair as a gift. I am happy with the build, shipping and quality for the the price. Their customer services is very attentive. I'd be happy to buy from them in the future.",0
4.0,Battery is great! Sound is not that good,"April 19, 2018",Yes,"I like the battery of this headphone. It can be last for over many many hrs. Bluetooth connection is awesome; i’ve been using it for a month, and don’t know how long it can be last. Will update my review next few months..The sound isn’t that great. Lack of bass sound.",0
5.0,"Great price, great value, very good listening experience","April 21, 2018",Yes,"I'm not an audiophile, but these are comfortable with good quality sound.  The microphone just doesn't work.  I tried using it as a headset with my Galaxy S8 and the experience for the other party was not great.  But that's not why I got them.",0
5.0,Great Value!,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have a great range.  I can leave my phone on the treadmill at the gym and walk across a couple of rows of machines while still hearing the audio.  It's easy to set up and connect.  I wish the charging cable was longer, but it was a great purchase.  I highly recommend it.",0
5.0,Awesome Cans,"August 25, 2017",Yes,These are easily the best sounding headphones I have ever had the pleasure of using. The bass is so clear and thumps just hard enough to not drowned out the treble. They look awesome and are quite comfortable. Very impressed with these. You're definitely getting your monies worth here. Highly recommended.,0
3.0,I bought these back in September and I loved using them,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"INITIAL REVIEW, 2 STARS: I bought these back in September and I loved using them, but just this past week I noticed the headset was starting to get hot whenever it was charging-- and today it will not turn on unless it's charging! I can't get it to connect with my computer anymore, which is completely frustrating since otherwise it was a decent headset!..UPDATE, 3 STARS: Their response was prompt and they sent me a new pair of headphones to replace the old one. Unfortunately, after charging it right out the box with the USB I was given, the new pair already started to overheat and refused to turn on. Bummer! I hadn't had a chance to use it.. :(",0
2.0,Very comfortable. Look great. Sound is TERRIBLE.,"August 4, 2017",Yes,"The headphones fall short on the main thing they are meant to do; why? I'm not an audio snob, I compare them to my MEE audio X6 Plus Stereo Bluetooth Wireless Sports In-Ear Headphones, $29.99, and ten year old Bose on-ear OE headphones, which both sound 100 times better than the Mpow. I purchased the Mpow based on the 4.5 star average rating and being a hottest seller.",2
5.0,My father loves them,"January 31, 2018",Yes,"I got these for my father for Christmas and he loves them. He wanted a nice pair of Bluetooth headphones that weren't the inner ear kind and these were perfect, he uses them all the time and loves that they're noise cancelling and that the sound comes out crystal clear.",0
5.0,Fashionable Gym-Goer,"November 11, 2018",Yes,"If I didn’t have these, it is VERY unlikely that I would actually go to the gym. The sound is great and they are super cute. I feel as though they are very noise canceling. Which is AWESOME. You can’t hear the grunts and groans from anyone lifting too much weight 🤷🏻‍♂️",0
5.0,... these because I didn't think the quality would be good. Well I was pleasantly surprised,"October 31, 2017",Yes,I was hesitant purchasing these because I didn't think the quality would be good.  Well I was pleasantly surprised.  The volume is adjustable and sounds great at the highest rating.  It easily connected to my bluetooth.  Makes my workout routine much more bearable.  The battery life is about 30 hours.  I charge only once per week.,0
5.0,Inexpensive decnet bluetooth headphones,"June 1, 2017",Yes,"I bought them for my gf. She likes them and they fit pretty well. She uses them at the gym and traveling mostly. The battery seems to last a while and the sound is decent for a bluetooth headset. It comes with a pouch to keep them in, a micro usb charging cable, and a regular headset jack if you want to use it that way.",0
5.0,"Amazing sound, yet amazingly painful to ears. UPDATE: They sent me a new pair. No more tightness","August 7, 2018",Yes,"Amazing sound, yet amazingly painful to ears.. Extremely Tight. I won't be returning these however it's extremely painful to wear them more than 5 minutes. Hurts my earlobe and jaw area a lot...UPDATE: Got the replacement headset after my review and the new ones are perfect. Maybe the olde ones had some issues. But nonetheless no more complaints as the sound was good even before just the tightness was too much. And by the way my head is not that big.",0
4.0,I love that. I rated it 4 stars because it's ...,"December 3, 2017",Yes,I bought these for me but my husband stole them and somehow connected them to the tv. Now he can watch certain shows while the kids are running around and I don't have to worry about the language. I love that. I rated it 4 stars because it's annoying to plug in to charge.,0
5.0,Excellent quality! Not great at noise blocking by the ...,"July 8, 2018",Yes,Excellent quality! Not great at noise blocking by the quality of music is satisfactory. I love the control panel on the side and the fact that there are voice prompts. I use it when I am studying in the resident's room,0
5.0,Best bang for your buck!,"October 14, 2018",Yes,I looked at a lot of headphones before buying these. I use them daily for about 9-11 hours at work on bluetooth. I finish my shift and still can use them at home. The range on the bluetooth is great as well. I forgot my phone at my workbench and walked about 150ft away before getting audio cutout. I would recommend these and buy them again if I needed another pair.,0
5.0,Good quality headphones,"May 23, 2018",Yes,I recently used the headphones at work.  I loved being able to zone out noises around so that I can get my work done. I will listen to music on my phone and I'm happy that I don't have a cord to get caught on my chair. Thanks for the good pair of headphones.,0
4.0,First wireless headphones.,"September 5, 2017",Yes,Battery last a long time and recharges quickly (after initial charge).  Sound is clear and the headphones are comfortable to wear.  I wear them while working out and they do not slip or slide.  Pairing can be a bit tricky but once your learn the correct amount of time to hold the button you are good.,0
4.0,Great custome service,"October 8, 2018",Yes,The costumer service was great! And they sent me a replacement for the defective ones and they work amazingly,0
5.0,They are really comfortable to wear,"January 23, 2018",Yes,They are really comfortable to wear. They have great sound. I wear them about 5hrs a day and they really keep the outside noise out even when i’ Not listening to anything. I am really happy I bought them.

5.0,Fabulous,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"They fit perfectly, the sound is clear and loud, they fold easily and the bag is of good quality, and they battery lasts for days. I recommended these to my friend and she loves them too. A+",0
4.0,"Comfortable, convenient and long lasting","April 19, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable, convenient and long lasting:.- Battery last a very long time.- Microphone is average.- Sound quality is average..Overall the mobile capability makes it nice to have along with long battery life. But the quality is average, not rich or deep.",0
5.0,Head phones,"August 29, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for the gym and they work well.  Are very comfortable and seem to be well built.  Connect up quickly with my phone, where I stored my music.  I have not used the head phones to take phone calls, so I can not review that function.",0
4.0,Worth the Price,"September 16, 2018",Yes,"A great brand of headphones with comfortability and a sleek appearance. Clean sound, and great noise-cancelling. They are certainly worth the price for what they’re being offered...The only negative I found, which may only be a matter of preference, was the rather average deepness to the bass when listening to music.",1
4.0,Recommended - especially at this price,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"I've tried several low cost (&lt;$50) BT over-the-ear headphones for watching movies on my tablet (Surface) and so far, the the Mpow 059 has been my favorite.  Comfortable, not too heavy (for over-the-ear phones), good battery life and simple operation. The audio sounds good for video but I don't listen to music that often and so can't really comment on how they might compare to true audiophile headphones.  No real complaints so far.  Worth the price.",0
4.0,value for your money,"July 3, 2018",Yes,It's reasonably priced and comfortable.  Definitely love the wireless or wired option.  But it's not for wearing for more than a couple of hours as it  pinches your ears and the band hurts my head.  The quality of the sound is also not that great but way better than most headphones I have had.,1
5.0,Price and sound reduction,"May 18, 2018",Yes,I bought these in 2017 when there were hurricanes coming in our area and didn’t want my 3 year old to cry or to be scared because of the sounds he heard at night. They work great! Price is excellent! Quality is great! We take these on trips (flights) and he knows how to slide them on and off with ease. They work nice with the iPad.,0
4.0,Lightweight and good sound,"August 6, 2017",Yes,These headphones are really nice!  Very comfortable and keeps out a lot of noise.  I love that they are wireless and also come with a aux cable.  I need that for flying on planes to watch TV.  It's also very easy to pair the headphones with my Iphone 7Plus.  I really do like these.  I would recommend them.,0
5.0,great sound quality and truely are wireless,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"Brought these for my son when starting high school for a particular class, however never needed them for the class so wears them as is.  Connects effortlessly, great sound quality and truely are wireless, he has been lucky with the range and can go outside and walk about and still get his music. The fold flat storage is also pretty good and saves on space.",0
5.0,BUY IT! best headphones to buy.,"March 15, 2018",Yes,"The best thing that I have bought on Amazon! Love the sound. Bluetooth connection flawless. Use it every day..I am so thankful it is cordless, don't have to worry about my phone being hurt by me accidentally pulling it with my headphones, or that the cord will be ruined. My cat chews cords. This is the best.",0
5.0,MPOW Rocks,"November 11, 2018",Yes,With the price - I will compare it to BEATS which cost almost $200+.The Quality of sound is good drowning everything around. I am in school and it makes concentration better when studying. Great product for the price.,0
2.0,Microphone doesn't work well at all,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"Worked fine as headphones, but the microphone was terrible. No one could hear me well - I sounded far away. The mic also seemed to produce strange background noise for people listening on the other end. This defeats the whole purpose of buying this, so I am returning.",0
5.0,No longer worry about annoying roommates,"January 7, 2018",Yes,I use these to watch television in my room and not annoy my roommates. I used to have to keep the volume way down and manually change volume for when shows got quieter or louder. Now I can have the volume super loud and I'm the quietest roommate ever! No issue with video audio sync which was my main hesitation - but the audio is perfectly in sync with n etflix. Battery life is super reasonable too! Charge it full and use it for a few nights in a row,0
5.0,Good,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"My kid is crazy about these headphones. It makes it hard for him to hear anything else when he has them on, so it cancels noises well. Don’t ride a bike or drive a car wearing them though.",0
5.0,Best headphones for the money.  Saved $45 on Amazon Prime!,"July 7, 2018",Yes,"Great sound and comfort.  Green color matches my workout shoes and shorts.  Folds in half and easily tucks away into small soft bag (provided) when not in use.  Easy controls for skip forward or reverse, volume up/down, pause, take/reject incoming phone call, etc.  Fits comfortably over glasses for over an hour.  Only downside is traps sweat IF you are working out heavily at gym (as do most other over the head headphones).",0
5.0,sound quality is good,"August 5, 2018",Yes,sound quaility was grainy on both tv and stereo system no improvement when using wired connection.Patozon has great customer service they sent me a newer model i did not have to do a thing.the new one is so much better.sound is really good with both TV and stereo system.get the bh092a it works great,0
4.0,The headphones appear well built and good fidelity if you use the wire,"October 20, 2017",Yes,"I proved my lack of knowledge with these.  I was looking for headphones for my bluetooth equipped desktop. They apparently are not designed to use with computers except with a wire.  The headphones appear well built and good fidelity if you use the wire, can't say when using bluetooth.",0
4.0,Headphones seem great. Easy to use,"May 20, 2018",Yes,"Headphones seem great. Easy to use, comfortable, and they stay on my head really well. I haven’t experimented with sound quality much but that seems good too...My one concern was that the box containing the headphones (not the amazon box, the one from the manufacturer) came filled with gritty white stuff. It was covering everything in the package - the headphones, cloth bag, even the cables that were in their own smaller plastic bag. I suspect it was a broken silica packet, though I couldn’t find the packet in the box, but it was concerning either way.",0
1.0,Not happy! The charging cable won’t keep charging,"January 4, 2018",Yes,Just got it today. Not happy! The charging cable won’t keep charging...the indicator light goes off until I jiggle it in the earpiece...most frustrating. I don’t know that it will actually completely charge!,1
5.0,Great for kids,"July 3, 2018",Yes,"First pair of blue tooth headphones that my kid didn't break... he's had them for several months and they are still going strong. They have a metal, rather than plastic clip that holds the speakers to the headband.",0
5.0,"Highly recommended item, when I bought these I was a ...","September 6, 2018",Yes,"Highly recommended item, when I bought these I was a little skeptical but wow the sound comes out really good and it's nice to be able to control the music options by just pushing the buttons on the side of the headphones. Color was very true to picture",0
5.0,Great headphones.,"August 14, 2018",Yes,"These work great! My daughter (9yo)  has had them for about a month and the sound is great and once connected to her tablet they’ve easily connected without my assistance. Love that they also have the option to connect with wires if she forgets to charge them, though the charge seems to last quite awhile.",0
5.0,Excellent quality headphones! Best gift ever!,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"I love my new Mpow bluetooth headphones! The sound quality is wonderful and for the first time ever I feel like I can enjoy my music. Earbuds just never fit correctly for me, but my new headphones fit like a dream and are super comfortable. Right down to the padded headband. The noise reduction is so good that my family often has to rap me on my shoulder to get my attention. I truly love these headphones!",0
3.0,Thought it would be better,"July 16, 2018",Yes,"This broke after 3 months of use and the Bluetooth was not very good. I could not understand why people love it until I decided to order it again, NOW I see the hype! The green one is the one that was not great the first round.",0
4.0,Awesome for the price,"January 6, 2018",Yes,"These head phones are really good , they sound great and they go over your ears. They are good to muzzle sound but it wont cancel it. You will still hear the outside world. For me, they are a little uncomfortable as they slide down my head a little. But all in all, great purchase.",0
5.0,LOVE THE COLOR,"April 9, 2018",Yes,LOVE THE COLOR! These are awesome! Took them on a test run the other day and they are great. I got tired of battling with my skull candy headphones while running and working out and the cord being in the way and once I tucked it in my shirt it would get stuck or the part sticking out from under my shirt would get caught on something...I am finally free and I love it.,0
5.0,"Awesome, fits great and no complaints about being uncomfortable","March 4, 2018",Yes,"Awesome, bought one for each of our kids. The kids really like these over other brands because it doesn't hurt their ears. The ear piece covers the entire ear. I even tried it on for me and it covers my entire ear, and I've got a big head. Worth the money.",0
5.0,Great Inexpenive Headphones,"March 14, 2018",Yes,Great product for the price. Obviously these are not going to satisfy the audiophile looking for high end sound. But for my need or office use and airplane usage they are phenomenal. Pairing is easy and links up each time they are turned on.,0
2.0,Built to a pricepoint.,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"Fell apart after a few months of gentle desktop use...Followup: Customer service did reach out to me after I posted this review, and sent a replacement item.",1
5.0,Best system I've found so far.,"July 31, 2017",Yes,"I'm a news and music junky,  it my tastes in music, jazz,  are not well served by radio. With the MPOW earphones using my iPhone I can listen to pandora play my music and shut out the chaos around me. Instead of local news I can listen to BBC or CBS, NPR, etc news and get a better idea of what is going on in the world..By the way, the sound quality is excellent.",0
4.0,Four Stars,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"Good headphones. They sometimes have issues with having short stuttering, but besides that works pretty good.",1
5.0,Best headphones I've ever had,"January 13, 2018",Yes,The shape of the hole in the headphone cushion makes these the only headphones that don't hurt my ears. Love them! They cancel out a lot of noise but aren't sound proof. Look great! Feel great! Sound great! Priced great! Love everything about them! 10 STARS!!!!!,0
5.0,comfortable headphones for the price.,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"bought this for my son as he has SPD and is very particular about what he wears and goes on his ears, for the price point I was worried that it would fall short but when he got it he loved how it felt and how it sounded, the bluetooth functionality was great for his phone. would recommend this product especially for the price.",0
5.0,Worth it.,"August 8, 2018",Yes,"They feel great on my head even while running. The sound is clear as well, it helps they close out oustao sounds some too...Though they don't get too loud, it's ok because I the sound canceling.",0
5.0,Great quality and sound!,"September 12, 2018",Yes,"I use these headphones mainly for private TV listening  in the evenings. No other headphones were reliable at this price range, nor as comfortable. These Mpow 059 headphones are substantial in the materials used, sound spectrum is great from treble to bass, and pair to bluetooth components quickly. These are really terrific!",1
5.0,Good quality for price,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"I really like the way it fits over the ears. It folds very neatly. I needed something not too expensive that I can take to the gym and can take a bouncing in my gym bag. So far, so good.",0
5.0,Best bang for buck,"September 13, 2018",Yes,"Light, long battery life, reasonably good sound, and very comfortable on the ears.....even when laying in bed.  Would definitely buy again.",1
4.0,Great product for the money,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Product arrived on time and as advertised.  Attractive, comfortable and easy to set up, pair and use for music .  Sound quality is good but not great. Excellent for the price, however.  Headset controls are easy to use. I have not yet used the phone.",0
1.0,Fake reviews,"April 1, 2018",Yes,"Reviews are fake, these are low quality and no where near comparable to Beats headphones. Even with my phone set to full volume you could hardly hear anything. There’s a light that blinks the entire time they are on so if you plan on using them at night this will be distracting. Good luck turning them since the pairing button and power button are the same. No matter how you press that button or how long you hold it they just try to pair and won’t power down. Very poor design and quality all the way around",0
5.0,They have great sound and isolation from the,"July 30, 2018",Yes,my daughter loves it. They have great sound and isolation from the surrounding,1
4.0,Nice Headphones overall,"June 29, 2018",Yes,I use these headphones at my desk at work. They have really great sound and fit my ears well. However when i wear them for prolonged periods of time they start to hurt the top of my head. But overall i'm very pleased with my purchase.,0
5.0,Loud distracting hum noise UPDATE: works great,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"They are very comfortable headphones and I really wanted to like them. However, they make a low hum noise when they are on. I thought maybe when I use them the hum would go away,  but it didn’t. I can hear the hum when listening to music, watching a video, or on a phone call. I will most likely return...UPDATE:.Company reached out to me and sent a replacement and there is no longer any loud hum with the new ones. Very happy with the service and the new headphones.",0
5.0,Works better then I thought,"September 26, 2017",Yes,"Works better then I thought.  I was able to go the other end of my house with only a slight loss in quality which is about 60 feet  (the max ratting was for 33).  The charging is simple and fast.  the controls are easy to understand.  On my computer (windows 10) not sure in it is the same for others it showed up as two different 'speaker options"" make sure you pick renderer for music and videos.  the other is for phone calls and has low quality sound.  the only other issue was that was a bit tight on my head but stretching it our working find to make up for that. Down side it has no battery indicator to let you know how much charge you have left that would nice to have.",0
4.0,Very comfortable on your head and ears,"January 15, 2018",Yes,"Solid compact Headphones. Very comfortable on your head and ears..Sound volume can go VERY high, so you can leave them on table and still listen to music in other room. Sound goes down tho right away you put it on your ears, so even if you listen music with high volume you will not bother others near you much...The only minus i recognized - is that it has a bit less noise control. You know, some music does have a bit noise in them, usually with good headphones you won't recognize and hear it, with this one you do tho.",0
5.0,"Super comfy, good sound quality, and good connection","January 13, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. I ended up giving my first pair to a friend. He had been wanting to get them but was worried they wouldn't fit his head or his ears. Me, being of small head and ears, bought them without worry, and let him test them out. He was surprised at how well they fit and how comfortable they were so I let him keep them, though he ended up buying a pair for his brother who kept stealing them.",0
5.0,Fantastic headphones! Excellent quality and price!,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"Wow! I love these wireless headphones! I purchased two of these for my husband and I. I paired my headphones with our Samsung Smart TV and my Samsung Galaxy phone. The sound is amazing! I can watch YouTube videos on my phone while my husband watches TV. This was a great buy. I'm very, very happy with my purchase.",1
5.0,These are my first bluetooth full size headphones. I am happy with them.,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"These Bluetooth headphones are sturdy, attractive and work well. One button controls the entire connection. The phones are easy to use, but some of the details take a while to pick up. For example, you can pause or restart a video by pressing that single button briefly.",0
4.0,Mostly like them,"August 30, 2017",Yes,"I think these sound really good, they are comfortable, and they block out a good amount of noise.  But I do get a lot of clipping where the sound cuts out for a moment.  I'm not sure if it's the headphones or the computer.  It also takes a few seconds to turn them on or off which is a little annoying.",0
5.0,A gift for my son!,"August 28, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these because of the high reviews and low cost. I like the color, they feel solid. Ear cups are soft and flex for a snug fit. Love that they fold and can easily be traveled with. Comes with charge cord and headphone jack, just in case the battery dies. Overall these headphones have a nice sound compared to the more expensive brands.",0
2.0,Two Stars,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"Actual product did not meet the specs provided..Updated 5/4/2018.  The company has sent a replacement and the sound is much better.  The issue was I ordered the noise cancelling version but I got one that was not noise cancelling.  I checked the description while the picture matched the product, the  features were not as advertised.  When I did try the original ones sent and the sound was bad. At this point I cannot change my review since I don’t know it it is amazon’s fault or the manufacturer’s fault for the web page description.",0
4.0,"Work well, would recommend","October 15, 2017",Yes,"I have had these about a week. So far the sound quality is good and WITH brown noise playing they work pretty well as far as noise cancellation. They are a little bulkier than I expected, and if worn at the wrong angle for long periods of time they can get uncomfortable. So far battery life is good and they pair with my phone without issue. Overall I would buy these again, good economical option.",0
5.0,These are incredibly comfortable. They fit completely over the ear,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"These are incredibly comfortable.  They fit completely over the ear, not squishing my ears at all, and they are compatible with glasses, which some over ear headphones are not.  The sound is great and the controls are quite intuitive.  A great deal for the price!",0
4.0,Very comfortable (fit over my large ears and don't feel too ...,"August 16, 2017",Yes,"Let me state the most important part of my review immediately: I've given this four stars due to its price at $36.99. At the original cost of $79.99, this would be a two-star product...PROS: Very comfortable (fit over my large ears and don't feel too hot even after working out).Feel sturdy and look really nice.Easy to operate (even tell you audibly when they power up, activate Bluetooth, power off, etc)..CONS: Mediocre sound (bass sounds muffled, highs don't really pop)..The bottom line: at $37, these are good headphones. The sound isn't satisfying, but it's not awful. At $80, these would be a colossal rip-off.",0
5.0,Recommend these wireless headphones,"July 18, 2017",Yes,"Sturdy, comfortable, great sound, easy set-up, the bass is just right, good sound range,  good bluetooth range, battery life is per manufacturer.  These are really great headphones.  I love the red/black color styling.  Padding on the ears is comfortable.  Padding on the head bar is good too.  Very reasonable price.",0
1.0,Came Broken,"July 23, 2018",Yes,"I got my headphones and they came broken. It sounds like I am listening to something under water. They are super fuzzy, and I can barely hear voices over the white noise. I have tried to contact the company but have gotten an anti spam warning every time I submit my problem. I just want them replaced with a pair that works.",1
5.0,Excellent,"March 31, 2018",Yes,"Purchased for a spouse with early Alzheimers and some minor hearing loss. This is simple enough for him to use on his own with his iPad and helps me with some peace and quiet. I only have to do the charging for him, but that's fine by me because we're both happy and the charge lasts quite awhile so far.",0
5.0,OH WOW,"July 11, 2018",Yes,I have gone through a lot of pairs of budget Bluetooth headphones and it is definitely worth it to spend a little extra for these and at $35 I will compare these two a lot of higher-end headsets for way less.,0
4.0,Good customer service,"February 11, 2018",Yes,"I left a one-star review a while ago as the headphone was not charging at all. Shortly after leaving my review, I received a new headphone! I never asked for it and appreciated this kind gesture. The new headphone works well. Good sound quality and easy pairing.",0
5.0,Mpow bluetooth headphones,"June 27, 2017",Yes,So far love the sound had bose and beats before but this babies give it a run for their money love em.wish they worked on my ps4,3
1.0,They have too much static and is really hard to ...,"January 25, 2018",Yes,They have too much static and is really hard to listen to music in the gym while working out which not keep me concentrated makes me frustrated.,1
4.0,Lasted about 6 months,"June 15, 2018",Yes,"Loved these things while they lasted. I work alone so I'm on them all day listening to podcasts, music and talking on the phone. No complaints. I've had them for 6 months and they no longer charge. I guess it's to be expected for $25 +/-",0
1.0,The red has been working just fine for my son who constantly uses it,"March 14, 2018",Yes,Bought 2 a red and a green. The red has been working just fine for my son who constantly uses it. I haven't used it much but took it out today to replace the one i had and only side of the headphones work. Disappointed as the return period is now passed for replacement. Should have checked it prior but didn't think it would malfunction as the other one works perfectly fine.,1
5.0,"These headphones fit comfortably, and the sound is perfect","January 4, 2018",Yes,"These headphones fit comfortably, and the sound is perfect.  I don't hear surrounding noises normally, they would have to be pretty loud.  I have them hooked up to blue tooth also, so I can walk around comfortably listening to music.  I am quite happy with them.",0
5.0,Too much static,"February 26, 2018",Yes,"Update: The seller sent me a new pair of head phones. These work great! No static...I really wanted to like these headphones. I wear glasses so I was looking for headphones that would fit comfortably on my ears while wearing glasses. These headphones have way too much static. I do not know if they all have static, but my pair has too much. Not worth $35. Look elsewhere.",0
5.0,the battery life is so amazing. this thing last so long i hardly remember ...,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"SUPERB PRODUCT. the battery life is so amazing. this thing last so long i hardly remember charging it..sound is great, very comfy and takes a while to feel the pressure from wearing it too long..great product over all. the description is on point. need thing more from me.",0
4.0,Great for our application and more.,"October 7, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones for what we are using them for. We bought a blue tooth transmitter and watch tv and movies so we don't wake up the kids. Some people have mentioned that it is lower on bass. While this may be true for hip hop or other bass heavy music, the bass is not bad. Clear sound and decent high ends. They are not high end which is why only the 4 stars but I can't stress enough that there are great headphones especially for the price!  We are ordering a second pair for my wife so we can both watch tv together in silence.",0
5.0,Elegant and well made - I love them,"August 29, 2018",Yes,When I first opened the box I was delighted how elegant they were.  They are amazing.  I didn't even know that they folded up and came with a little bag.  They are easy to use and they sound great and really hug your ears.  I'm impressed!,0
5.0,Excellent sound for great price!,"July 4, 2017",Yes,"So far, loving these very high quality sounding headphones that replaced a wire pair of studio monitor headphones that had the tip break off inside my iPad. Need high quality audio, without the wire, and these delivered. Battery life is very good as I have used over a week and haven't need to recharge yet..",0
4.0,Issue was resoled,"September 17, 2017",Yes,Initially I had issue:.Left speaker sounds quieter than the right one. Not significantly but I can clearly hear the difference. The same over Bluetooth and via cable. I checked on few tests and compared to other my headphones. No my other headphones have such issue on the same tests - even my 5 dollar earbuds don't have such problem. I am very disappointed. (( my wife can't hear the difference that's why 2 stars instead of one...But after my feedback seller has contacted me and offered free replacement and received product doesn't have any issues. So now I am 100% satisfied.,0
5.0,Beautiful Neon Green Headphones,"May 11, 2018",Yes,THIS IS MY SWEETHEART. I TAKE IT EVERYWHERE I GO. IT'S THE BEST HEADPHONES EVER! I will continue to purchase this should my current ones fail me. Absolutely gorgeous. Arrived on time. Couldn't ask for anything better! Thank You!!!,0
5.0,Rocking headset,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"Perfect sound quality, excellent material, strong and sturdy. Love the grey storage bag that comes with it. Easy to pair to iPhone or iPad. Definitely a must have. Superb battery life!",0
5.0,Absolutely worth every penny,"November 11, 2018",Yes,"I bought two of these to allow the children to listen to their fire tablets while we were in the car. In the meantime I have been using them to listen to my own music, they are honestly one of the best devices I've ever bought for listening to music. Very rich sounds very comfortable durable and a strong battery...Worth the money",0
5.0,Great Head!!!!,"August 9, 2017",Yes,"Great comfortable headphones for a good price. I have had them for a few weeks now and can say their quality passed my expectations based on their price. The only thing I think that could be lmproved on,  is the control button. It can be a bit confusing try to adjust the volume while they are on your head.",0
5.0,Well worth the money!,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are really good headphones. I feel like these could be more expensive, like $60-$80 and I’d still be very happy with them. Sound is clear and nice, noise cancellation is real good. Definitely worth the money!",0
1.0,Very disappointing,"March 18, 2018",Yes,I’ve had them less than 2 months and the power button is already broken. Plus everyone can hear what I’m listening to which is annoying since i take the subway every day in NYC and don’t want other people to have to listen to my music... ugh,0
5.0,Play/Pause/On/Off button stopped working,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"After a little problem with my set that I loved using, the seller was great to help out with solving the issue.",1
5.0,Overall Great Buy for the Price,"September 6, 2017",Yes,"Honestly a great buy. The wireless/wired feature was the sell point for me. I prefer wireless headphones but of course hate when the battery dies cuz now... I don't have headphones. Simply put I don't worry about when they're going to die quite as much and I can still use them with other equipment such as studio equipment. They're very comfortable to wear in general. Not terribly bulky. Love the fact it has a microphone, didn't actually expect that. Battery life is surprisingly good if you ask me. Tone range is acceptable for normal daily usage. Folding feature really does come in handy as well. All in all, it's a great buy for me, not disappointed in any way so far. And that's surprising.",0
5.0,Amazing,"September 23, 2018",Yes,I bought this for my brother and he loves it,1
4.0,This headset is incredibly comfortable and I have a large head - normally a ...,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"This headset is incredibly comfortable and I have a large head - normally a comfortable over the ear headset is HARD to find because they are too tight on my head. This one fits without pressing in on my head. I do think it would be nicer for the cord to be a bit longer as I cannot use the one that came with it comfortably - however, I mostly use it wirelessly and it works just fine for that. The built-in mic is not great quality but you can use it when on Bluetooth.",0
5.0,Great fitting headphones.,"April 1, 2018",Yes,"Exactly as advertised. Highly recommend. Don't let the fact that these don't have Active Noise Cancellation, the passive noise cancellation does a surprisingly great job at keeping outside noise down to a minimum. The sound quality is fantastic compared to my Bauhn christmas gift from Aldi, not that they are terrible. However, I wanted the bluetooth function while I am travelling. I have a relatively large shaped head and they sit comfortably over my ears. Purchase with confidence.",0
5.0,These are great!,"November 5, 2017",Yes,"My 9 year old loves these. She can Bluetooth to wear them as she does her chores, or use the cord if she wants as well. They fit her ears well, and she likes that they don't cause her ears to get sore like ear buds do. Sound quality is good and the noise canceling is great.",0
3.0,"Fits well, static sound","October 17, 2018",Yes,"Nice loud and clear headphones that are comfy and great for the gym. HOWEVER, if you are changing songs or people are talking quietly through the speakers, you'll often hear a soft static sound in the background. Doesn't seem to happen with the louder sounds but it does get pretty annoying.",0
3.0,"Work fine, but too tight in the head and ears.","December 18, 2017",Yes,"They work fine, but I used them during my stationary bike ride, and they filled very tight after 30 minutes of using.  Also very warm in the ears.  I been using them form a month and sometimes the sound stops without a reason, I need to turn them off/on and reconnect again.",0
5.0,Quality headphones for a great price!,"July 26, 2018",Yes,"Super comfortable, and amazing sound quality! I definitely recommend these. As a mom who uses these at night after the kids are asleep, (so not to disturb them or the hubby) great sound while still being able to hear the babies if they wake up! Love these!! And they come in Rose Gold, can’t get much better for $40!!",0
5.0,Very nice,"July 24, 2018",Yes,"So far very happy with these.  Sound is good, comfortable, easy to connect to bluetooth, nice that you can actually plug in if you don't want to connect. Also you can connect 2 things at the same time.",0
5.0,I ordered and honestly very happy I did,"January 23, 2018",Yes,I read many reviews before purchasing and I must say initially I was skeptical. I ordered and honestly very happy I did. The sound quality is actually amazing. they are comfortable and stay in place. These are a great buy especially for the price.,0
5.0,I love these!,"July 20, 2017",Yes,I love these !!! ..... use them for bike riding at a low sound level; they stay fit perfectly and no sliding around on my head.  And when it's chilly they keep my ears warm and out of the wind.  I love 'em !@!..And then I bought a pair for my daughter because she liked using mine so much !@!,0
3.0,"Good sound, long lasting battery, bad microphone","January 9, 2018",Yes,"Its a good product. The sound is clear and easy to connect and to use..I love that it has the optional cable to use it wired, and the battery lasts almost forever!..What I didn't like is the microphone. I bought these for work but I can't use them because of the microphone, I need to yell to make people hear me, and I tried in different devices",0
5.0,Slick looking headphone,"July 28, 2018",Yes,Got it for my kids for travel but I can't get them off now...  They loved it so much they wearing it around the house.  Very slick looking headphones and good sound ( I am not audiophile).  Muffles external sound well.  Great price.  Unless you are an audiophile you can't go wrong here.,0
4.0,Battery lasts for a very long time which is awesome and convenient,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"Battery lasts for a very long time which is awesome and convenient. Top part came apart easily and hard to use when working out because the fabric stays wet for up to two days..*Edit* My head phones were replaced, I gave the new one to my mother, she loves it",0
4.0,They have excellent reviews and an excellent price,"January 5, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my husband.  They have excellent reviews and an excellent price.  He thinks the sound is great.  His only complaint is that the head band is not adjustable and they are a little tight on his head and ears. They squeeze a little to tight.,0
5.0,Nice tight fit that don't move around regardless of what ...,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"Using these for the gym.  Nice tight fit that don't move around regardless of what I've been doing (weights, treadmill).  Great bass that drowns out all the noise.  I've never tried the more expensive models but really can't see how they could be $200+ better than these.",0
4.0,I like these headphones a lot,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"I like these headphones a lot. They are comfortable and sound great, and a great price. They are also well made and come with a travel bag. My only complaint is that while the headphones are in use there is a light that circles the circular button on the ear portion that flashes. I blacked it out with a black sharpie because it was annoying in dim settings but not annoying enough to return them.",0
5.0,... could connect with Bluetooth and Mpow 059 do a perfect job. Very easy to connect and comfortable to ...,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"I have been a long time fan of Sennheiser headphones but my new TV didn't come with the connectors needed and I had to find one that could connect with Bluetooth and Mpow 059 do a perfect job.  Very easy to connect and comfortable to wear for a couple of hours,",0
1.0,Muddy bass and Lacks mids/highs,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"Yes they are relatively inexpensive but if compared to my apple ear buds (which are same price) they definitely lack mids and highs. There is more bass for sure but that benefit is lost as the bass is very ""muddy"" and lacks a crispness and clarity. So I have actually preferred listening to my ear buds since the quality is higher...and when I need to drown out the kids I put these on.",1
1.0,Won't hold a charge,"February 5, 2018",Yes,"Purchased this in November 2017, and didn't want to spend $300+ on headphones for something that I probably wouldn't use  too often.  However, whenever I did use these headphones, the battery/USB charge never lasted more than 10-20 mins (if not less sometimes).  I would allow it plugged into the USB charger for a few hours and whenever I needed it to play the battery died quickly.  This wasn't a once or twice occurrence but routinely happened.  Since I passed the return date/policy, its just sitting around.",0
4.0,Could be better - but definitely good for the price,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"These are nice - I can wear them for a long time without them hurting my ears (not the case with so many over or on-ear headphones). They do a good job of keeping noise out, but they have a lot of noise bleed themselves.",0
5.0,The made a little girl very happy,"August 10, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my daughter. she has been extremely pleased and uses them all the time. The battery lasts long.  The sound quality has been very good and they seem to be well built.  I would no hesitate to purchase another set.,0
5.0,"It feels sturdy, shouldn't break easily","July 13, 2018",Yes,"I am impressed.  It feels sturdy, shouldn't break easily.  It sounds great.  Nice clarity and bass (I like my music loud).  It was easy to sync with my iPhone and easy to operate.  I wear it at the gym every day, and the earphones are comfortable.  I'm very surprised this doesn't cost a lot more.",0
4.0,Good quality headphones,"February 22, 2018",Yes,These people go the extra mile to make sure you are happy. 18 month warranty and even emailed extra tips and instructions. Comfortable fit and easy to pair with my ipod. My only gripe is I wish the volume was a bit higher. All and all a good buy,0
3.0,They're good headphones.,"August 23, 2017",Yes,"They're good headphones... BUT if you have dumbo ears like me, DO NOT GET THEM. My ears hurt badly as the ear cup size is way too small and the headphones puts a lot of pressure on your ears... so it's not a good combination. If I didn't have these problems, I would not return and them",1
5.0,One of the best headphones I've purchased!,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones - clear, rich tones - very good blue tooth, no drop-outs.  Headphones fit a bit tight on my pumpkin head, but confortable enough to go several hours without ear aches.  Very easy to pair and VERY quiet - one of the best headphones I've purchased!",0
5.0,"Pairs with phone, games and Groove Music.","July 22, 2017",Yes,"This has worked great paired with my cell phone.  Tried connecting to my company computer's BT, but it didn't seem to work.  Got the MPOW USB BT 4.0 adapter for the home laptop and it connects well.  Groove music and games come through fine.  iTunes doesn't seem to like it, though.  I haven't tried Skype (yet).",0
5.0,Comfortable,"September 18, 2018",Yes,I listen to a lot of podcasts at night and these make it so much more comfortable for me. I have a problem with the ear pods hurting after awhile.,1
5.0,Nice Bang for the Buck,"July 14, 2018",Yes,"For a cheap price -- nice quality, very comfortable and solid noise cancellation even though it is not advertised as such. They charge fast and last forever -- these will hold me over until I get the Sony QC 35's (and that is if I even bother to at this point) -- very satisfied customer and the color options are a bonus. I have received a lot of compliments. As an audiophile -- I am content.",0
5.0,Great Sound Quality,"December 16, 2017",Yes,These headphones are great.  The sound quality is amazing.  I unfortunately had to return them.  I suffer from chronic headaches and the top part touching my head gave me a headache.  I was very disappointed.  I ended up buying Bose earbuds which I am very happy with.,0
4.0,Quality and comfort are a go,"February 6, 2018",Yes,Gave 4 stars b/c the power button is also the pair button and every time you shut them off it goes through the pair process first - so it always tells you “pairing” and then “shut down” - the literature on this is vague and not accurate in my experience.,0
4.0,but I like being wireless and the sound is good,"June 19, 2018",Yes,"They don't cancel noise at all, but I like being wireless and the sound is good. I've used these for hours and I'm still on the factory charge, I haven't had to plug them in yet, so I'd say battery life is good.",0
5.0,Better than expected,"November 1, 2017",Yes,I love these head phones. For the price they can't be beat. They link up with your device seamlessly and a voice in your ear makes sure you know what's going on between the phones and your device. The tone is perfect with just enough bass and treble. Well worth the money.,0
5.0,"Great deal, good comfort, great sound","December 5, 2017",Yes,I love the colors. that is what attracted me. Then the price was very affordable so I thought i would try them. They fit wonderfully completely covering my ears so no impinging going on. Blocks out area noise  but not completely so they work great for me at work. The sound is great. I am thoroughly enjoying them. People keep asking where i got them. Said they look like BEATS.,0
4.0,Works,"November 17, 2018",Yes,It keeps disconnecting from the iPhone and has to be re-activated,1
5.0,Fantastic headphones at a great price!,"September 28, 2017",Yes,Awesome wireless headphones!  We ordered three of these (one for each of my children) and they are great!!  My husband and I even use them.  Battery life lasts a LONG time and very comfortable!  I would definitely recommend anyone to purchase if wanting a great priced wireless headphones!!!!,0
5.0,Pretty good headphones,"November 7, 2018",Yes,The headphones last a good 20 hrs or more on battery and are very comfortable to wear. They don't hurt your ears or head after using them for many hours of studying and they are great to use at the gym. The convenience of the buttons is very handy and answering calls is pretty simple too. It's overall a great product for any students who want some headphones for multiple kinds of uses.,0
5.0,Half Marathon Trainig Headphones,"July 21, 2018",Yes,I wear these for my half marathon training runs. I was so sick of wearing earbuds that were falling out of my ears! These are just light enough not to bother me or move around when I’m jogging. The battery after charging seems to last forever. Quickly connects to Bluetooth. Love them!!,0
5.0,Product works as advertised,"August 24, 2017",Yes,"Excellent product. While I am not an expert in music, I find the quality of the output to be very good both in wired and Bluetooth mode (base is very good). The shape of the ear piece is good for keeping the sound in for me and external sounds out. The fit is a little tight, but this is good for me, they don't fall off.",0
4.0,Low Price Alternative,"June 19, 2017",Yes,Great value for the price.  No they are not 'reference' headphones and the sound quality is pretty good at best.  But they seem to be fine for my gym workouts which is why I purchased them instead of high dollar options.  I did not want to have to worry about losing or breaking a $200 set of super nice headphones.,0
5.0,The quality of this headphone can't be described through words but I'll try!,"August 5, 2018",Yes,The quality of this headphone can't be described through words. Just go ahead and purchase them now. I fully charged mine before use and it was ready to go after it was done charging. I am super impressed with this product and the other reviewers were not lying when the spoke about how comfortable it is. I wear glasses as well but there are no problems at all. Another big plus for me is that the headphones have their separate volume control so you can turn it up louder when your phone volume is maxed.,0
5.0,Great sound and comfort for price....,"February 10, 2017",Yes,Thinking of buying a second pair for my wife....They are great!!!!!,10
4.0,Great customer service.,"July 5, 2018",Yes,My headphones have already stopped working in one ear and the sound is actually very average. Noticeably fuzzy with time..The battery life has also decreased significantly...------------..I thought it was a mistake when I received another pair of Mpow headphones in the mail. But it seems they sent me a new pair. Perhaps the first pair was dysfunctional. I'm going to raise my review to 4 stars now for the incredible customer service and I will come back to raise it higher if these work differently!,0
4.0,Decent headphones at a respectable price with very good sound quality,"July 29, 2017",Yes,"Decent headphones at a respectable price with very good sound quality.  The fit and finish is very good, with soft ear pads.  The wireless feature is a great feature at this price and links via bluetooth with my laptop for listening to tunes.  I purchased these to also block out noise.  It does a reasonably good job and outside noises are not completely blocked, but are essentially muted.  Works fine for me.  With other headphones priced much higher (some in the hundreds of dollars), these are a better value for basic use.",0
5.0,Great Bluetooth headset,"December 5, 2017",Yes,I love this Bluetooth headset.  The over the ear style is very comfortable.  The sound is great and they block out outside sound.  The other feature I like is that when you turn them on there is a voice that tells you that you have turned them on and it also tells you when you are paring them and when you have turned them off.,0
5.0,Best bang for the buck,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are legit, great bang for the buck. I use these to run, goto the gym, sauna and it has been reliable, quick to charge with a very long battery life. Definitely glad I got these over the overpriced beats but that’s just my opinion",1
5.0,Great product at a reasonable price.,"July 4, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for my artistic 12 year old, as they are noise cancelling for long trips by air. They work great, and are still holding up well, even with rough handling. They hold charge, and come with an aux cable for when the batteries do die, which is a nice backup plan. My kid likes the feel, which is important with a child with a sensory disorder.",0
5.0,Great headset,"November 16, 2018",Yes,Basically I'm using these plugged into my PC  to listen to music/radio while I'm working.  Works great so far.  I turned my volume up almost all the way and had no crackling at all.,0
5.0,Great product!,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"I got these as a gift for my dad and he loved them. They connect through bluetooth but also come with a cord in case bluetooth is not available. It also includes a small pouch to store them in. They are comfortable, fold inward when ready to store them away and the sound is great!",0
2.0,Well-made and a comfortable fit.,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"Initial review: The headphones are well-made and fit comfortably. The battery life also seems pretty impressive. 4 Stars..Update: The headphones lasted less than one year. The control piece fell off. Also, the sound quality isn't particularly good. 2.5 Stars",0
5.0,I love these headphones,"April 13, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones! Bluetooth connects to everything (my galaxy s5, my macbook, my tv sound bar). Don't really use the chord but it works too. It came charged and it played without needing a recharge for about 3 days! Worth the money.",0
4.0,Pretty good,"June 25, 2017",Yes,Sound is good but not enough bass for me. I like to feel the bass. I usually have it on the wire and it's good. Battery life is exceptional. Haven't charged it since I first got it about a month ago. Only use Bluetooth when cutting grass for about 2 hours a week. The microphone doesn't seem to work that well. The person on the other end of the phone had a hard time hearing me. It does get loud at max volume and works well with blocking outside noise but it gets a little uncomfortable on my ears after about a hour of wear. Maybe I have fat ears.,0
4.0,Right side stopped working after a few months,"July 26, 2018",Yes,"They were great while they worked.  Unfortunately, the right side died after a few months.  Really disappointing, since I've had cheaper headphones that have lasted longer than this...Update: Patozan sent me a new pair at no cost to me.  Thus far, they work perfectly.  Thank you so much!",0
1.0,Don't get it,"March 18, 2018",Yes,"Whenever I went to bed I would put it on charge. The next day it went idle so I'd have to reconnect it which is fine. However it wouldn't reconnect. I would instead have to delete the drivers from my computer, restart my Bluetooth adapter, then restart my PC, and then repair the headset...And I'd have to do that every day. I'm not going to do that. That's a hassle. I'm not going to suggest this product to anyone. If you're just going to use wired mode that might be fine but the Bluetooth functionality is awful.",0
3.0,Worth the money but leaves some things to be desired,"February 4, 2018",Yes,"As others have mentioned, the sound quality (specifically the lower range) is not great on these but they are I think still worth the money. I will be giving these to my 12-year-old and be buying myself a better product because I am picky about my sound quality and he will use it for playing games.",0
5.0,Fine headphones.,"February 20, 2018",Yes,"Good, comfortable. Thank you for the good customer service also.",1
5.0,Great quality for a low price,"October 21, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones! They are large enough to fit over my entire ear so which means I can wear them for extended periods of time without getting sore (my previous headphones rested on my ear which became pretty uncomfortable after an hour). The sound is good and the passive noise cancellation is good as well. Overall, could not ask for a better pair of headphones at this asking price!",0
4.0,Does not charge,"October 3, 2018",Yes,"Received my headphones today and tried charging, but the red light only stays on for about a minute then goes out...UPDATE:.I reached out to the seller regarding the broken headphones I received and they were replaced. The new one I receive is working great thus far.  The seller was very cooperative.",0
5.0,Sound Quality is great too.,"February 14, 2018",Yes,Haven't charged it since I bought it.  I use it daily and it's still going.  Its been about a week and I use it probably 2 hours + a day.... Sound Quality is great too....,1
5.0,Great price for very nice headphones!,"July 26, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones. While I can't compare them to any others, like some have here, all I know is they sound great. Comfortable and easy to set up. At this price I don't think you can beat these. Cheers!",1
4.0,Good value,"September 13, 2018",Yes,"Good for the price. I use this with an Mpow Bluetooth transmitter on my computer. Has good range with it as wel. My biggest complaint is every time I power on the headphones, I have to pair it with the transmitter again. Not sure if it’s the transmitter or head phones though.",0
4.0,Love these! They stay on very well while exercising,"May 8, 2018",Yes,Love these! They stay on very well while exercising. My only compliant is the low battery notification is only 5 minutes before it dies;I wish it was an hour so I knew before I'm only 5 minutes into an hour long workout.,0
5.0,Great Sound. Fits Nicely. Connects Quickly.,"December 9, 2017",Yes,I love the soft fit on my ears and they store nicely. Great sound. BT connects quickly. Long use on a charge. I use for music and for TV (TV must have BT built in or able to add). Comes with a protective bag. Same great quality as the MPOW ear BT device also.,0
4.0,great product,"February 16, 2018",Yes,great sound and long battery life. had these for a month and use them for an hr or so every few days and still has a full charge. insane i love them!,1
5.0,Better than I expected,"June 1, 2017",Yes,"I didn't realize how much I needed these until they were on my head, comfort is 10/10. For this price, it's unbelievable. I also own a 200 dollar pair of Sennheiser 598's and these Mpow phones sound just as good.",1
5.0,So good he can’t hear his wife 🙃,"October 20, 2018",Yes,"Great sound, connects seamlessly, blocks out external noise really good. The control button takes a little getting used too. Unclear what the difference between holding the control button to turn them off or request it to pair.",0
5.0,Great product at a great price!,"May 30, 2018",Yes,I found these to be exceptional headphones for the price. They pair well with any device and have great range. Lightweight and comfortable to wear. I would recommend these over headphones that cost much more.,0
4.0,18 month warrenty,"August 20, 2018",Yes,They worked great the first 9 months then stopped connection to my Bluetooth.  I called Mpow hopefully to exchange them. The girl repeatly asked the same questions over and over.  I have received the replacement and they work great.  No problems at all..They have a good product but they need some work on there customer relations.,0
5.0,"Honestly, I Love These","August 30, 2017",Yes,"My entire goal when looking for headphones was to find a comfortable hair of over-ear headphones with decent sound quality. These Mpow headphone really deliver to my needs, and I was very impressed. The earpad hugs your ear, making it comfortable for a listening experience. The bass is actually suprisingly good!! I have listened to more expensive headphones before and not a lot of them stand up to these. They aren't noise cancelling, if that's what you are looking for, but they still sound awesome for a cheap pair of headphones. I would definitely recommend!!",0
5.0,M POW! Wow they sound good.,"July 31, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are amazing. They sound SO GOOD! Best sounding headphones I've ever used. Very comfortable even after wearing them for 13 hours straight. And the battery life really holds up. They advertise 14 hour battery life, but it's really more like 20 hours before you'll need to charge.",0
3.0,It’s an OK product,"May 2, 2018",Yes,Pos-  The build quality is good and they’re comfortable to wear ..Neg-  The buttons are very difficult to navigate when they’re on your head and they don’t get very loud.. Overall they’re OK for in home use or maybe the kids in the car. But for working outside or on the mower there are useless.,1
5.0,"Great sound, great everything!","November 1, 2018",Yes,"The headset first of all, fits perfectly, a major plus.  The sound and quality are fantastic!  No complaints about this product whatsoever.  Thank you for having this available for purchase.",0
3.0,"They are nice otherwise, good fit comfortable right up till your ...","February 13, 2018",Yes,"It is my opinion that these are too hot. They are nice otherwise, good fit comfortable right up till your skin starts sweating under the muffs. I wanted to wear them cutting the grass in the Spring/Summer, I dont think they will work for that now.",0
4.0,Excellent Sound,"April 5, 2018",Yes,Very solid and beautiful sound. I am having a little difficulty with them being too tight over periods of long wear (over an hour). Would recommend trying on over the ear vs. on ear headphones to decide which are more comfortable to you before you decide on a pair.,0
5.0,Good sound quality at a great price.,"August 27, 2017",Yes,"The sound is great and they fit very comfortably over the ears for extended times, even though I wear eyeglasses, so that's a plus. While these aren't of a sound quality such as Beat headphones, the price is way better and they do sound good. I use them for my electric drum kit so I don't bother anyone when I'm playing. They fold up very well some that you can store them away in a drawer without taking up too much space. I would recommend these to a friend. Thanks.",0
5.0,Reasons why I love my Pink Mpow 059 Bluetooth Headphones,"October 8, 2018",Yes,#1 - super cute!!.#2 - they sound great.#3 - I only used Bluetooth once and it worked fine.Did I mention that they are super cute and way more comfortable &amp; lighter than my Beats?.Very happy with this purchase!,0
5.0,Love them!,"April 25, 2018",Yes,Love them! Perfect for tuning out everything and just being able to hear the music or movie. Only thing I have found that I’m not too crazy about is that someone close to you can hear the sound some if you have it turned up to a certain point.,0
4.0,They also fit very comfortably while wearing glasses,"January 15, 2018",Yes,I received these headphones yesterday and use them on my computer to listen to music while I work and I am surprised how well they sound. They also fit very comfortably while wearing glasses. Will be interested how long the battery life lasts with them.,0
4.0,Very disappointed.,"March 18, 2018",Yes,I’ve used these maybe ten times and the Bluetooth stopped working. Very disappointed. I’ll try contacting the company since they’re under warranty...Updating to four stars. Mpow contacted me to replace the headphones. Hopefully this works out. I’ll update again when I receive them and try them out.,0
5.0,Fantastic headphones for the price.,"October 7, 2018",Yes,"We got these for Xmas gifts last year, and my sons love them. They love the quality and ease of use. Very happy with this product. They have outlasted the $300 Beats headphones by months.",0
4.0,Great product. Worth the price,"December 28, 2017",Yes,"Great product. Worth the price. I use it with an iPhone and never have any problem pairing it with the headphones. My husband used it a few times with his android phone...never had any problem either. One annoying thing for me is that every time the headphones got connected/disconnected or power on/off, the woman sound from the headphones gets too lound. Even for people that are not using the headphones would hear it too. All in all, I’m satisfied with the purchase.",0
5.0,Sounds good,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"Good sound, great price. Got them hooked them up to my tv with not problem and now I can watch shows when the kids go to be and not have to worry about waking them up. They connected fine to my cell phone as well.",0
5.0,Lifespan could be better but fantastic customer service!,"October 10, 2017",Yes,These were good for about a month. Then they stopped pairing before they died altogether...UPDATE(10/25): The company got back to me and offered me a replacement or a refund. I ended up opting for a replacement to give it another try because the sound quality overall is good for the price.,0
1.0,Not worth your money,"February 20, 2018",Yes,"I’ll give them two stars since they worked well for the first month or so. Now the on button barely works. I can turn it on most of the time, but off is a gamble. And now it won’t connect to my phone or anything. These are not worth wasting your money!",0
5.0,Great frugal headphones.,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"Bought these on a whim as a warehouse deal. They feel very sturdy and have a good weight to them. The sound is good for the price, little weak on the bass but well worth it for what you pay. Comes with a nice storage bag, 3.5mm cable, and USB plug.",0
5.0,who has really enjoyed them. He feels like the sound quality is ...,"January 2, 2018",Yes,"This was purchased for my son, who has really enjoyed them. He feels like the sound quality is excellent, and he gets good range with them. He also likes to be able to plug them directly,into his computer when he needs to, as well. Great product!",0
2.0,good quality for music but uncomfortable to wear over 20mins :(,"December 3, 2017",Yes,I've been using the headphone for about a week now.. the quality of the music is ok..The downfall to the headphones is I cant keep them on for more than 20-30mins max. without having pains around my ears. The padding around the headphones feels comfortable but not when you place in your ear they are not over the long period of time. I wish they have different sizes to accommodate different customers needs.  I did ask for resolutions but the buyer asked me to send them back for a refund which is inconvenient.,0
4.0,Initial Reactions,"May 22, 2018",Yes,"Build Quality: The plastic feels cheap in the hand. However, the cushions are quite soft and comfortable...Performance: The sound quality is good for the price range. No quarrels here...Connectivity: I had to fuss with the headphones to get them to connect at first, but then I realized you simply have to hold the power button until it cycles red &amp; blue and your good.",0
5.0,Great product. Good price,"March 12, 2018",Yes,It was hard to find economical set of  Bluetooth headphones. I was skeptical about these but they were for a 13  yr old.  Well they are awesome. hey work great. He's had them 3 months and still good. His mom loved the and ordered a pair.,0
5.0,THE BEST THING I BOUGHT FOR CHRISTMAS,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"THE BEST THING I BOUGHT FOR CHRISTMAS! My son loves them and uses them daily since Christmas and just now for the first time had to charge them. They fold up,have great sound, hold a charge for a super long time! I am now going to buy some for myself!",0
4.0,"Very good, but","November 16, 2017",Yes,"Excellent sound for price, good battery life, nice controls and audio feed back (English voice makes announcements like ""power on"".).4 star because NO costumer support, When using them I had an no sound issue between discord and another program, believed it to be.discord problem (which discord ignored). But it was an issue which my old USB headset did not have.",0
3.0,Not the best...,"April 14, 2018",Yes,"Got this mostly to use it in the gym. Pros: looks nice, well made and easy to store. Cons: sound is not the best, the base is not strong. It feels bulky because it's heavy and big on your head. And for me it hurt a bit after wearing for over an hour from the squeeze.  Bottom line is not the best even for this price range.",0
5.0,Amazing buy! Great price,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"Amazing buy!  Great price, comfortable, great sound.  They get good range on the Bluetooth too!  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  The bass could be better, but for less than $50 I have no complaints.",0
5.0,These sound almost as good as my beats headset,"August 12, 2018",Yes,These sound almost as good as my beats headset. Cannot believe how inexpensive they are. My son uses these for his audiobooks. One odd thing is you have to keep pressing past pairing mode to turn off.,0
5.0,Great headphones,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"Very nice sound and it's easy to connect. I once wore this on on a pool raft and fell in, and they still work! Didn't know they were waterproof, too. Are they? Maybe I'm just lucky. Very happy with my purchase. I wear these to work everyday, and have received complements on them from those who wear Beats.",0
4.0,Impressive battery life so far,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"Great set of headphones for the price. I bought these the first week of January, charged it, and have used it for at least 25 hours (more than 4 hours/week for the past six weeks) before the battery finally died &amp; needed recharging. Excellent compared to other bluetooth headphones I've tried...Pros: Comfortable, cute, long battery life, easy-to-feel controls on the right side, great sound..Cons: Not totally soundproof, but I wouldn't expect that from a pair of headphones at this price.",0
5.0,Low quality-disappointed,"April 25, 2018",Yes,**EDIT**..Company sent a new pair free of charge! I was not expecting that. Really great service..Did not even last one month before breaking. Only one side has a faint sound when playing music. Other side does not work at all.,0
5.0,Excellent Bass and Surround Sound,"August 16, 2018",Yes,"I ordered this headphone for my son, but I am the one who is listing it the most. If you are looking for True Stereo Surround Sound and excellent Bass !  This headphone is for you.",1
5.0,Great quality for the $$$,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"I bought a Sony brand bluetooth head phones for more money than i paid for these. When i got these, i took the Sony brand back. These are high quality and has awesome sound and clarity. Would purchase again and highly recommend this product!",0
1.0,Seemed good when I got it but now Defective????,"July 6, 2018",Yes,I was surprised with this Bluetooth headphones. The sound is great and like the fold up feature! But after just 3 months it now is defective and the Audio now cuts in and out all the time!!!  :-((,0
5.0,Great Sound and Comfort,"November 26, 2017",Yes,These headphones are great. They size adjustment is easy and allows the them to fit my LARGE head comfortably. The sound quality is great. I have been pleasantly surprised with the comfort and sound. Very pleasant to wear for reasonable periods of time.,0
5.0,Works Great,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"Good sound, Love the fact that it says ""power on"", ""power off"" when turning it on and off instead of guessing. distance is good as well, i can cruise through the whole house.",0
5.0,Great customer service,"February 22, 2017",Yes,"This is the best pair of headphones I've owned. They are very comfortable and I use them a lot at my desk job and sometimes go days without charging them, so they hold a charge for a long time. I have yet to hear a battery low signal. I just hope they hold up because for the price, you usually get what you pay for it. This is a great product for $36. I've had another pair in this price range and they quite charging. I'm holding my breath something like that doesn't happen with these but should it happen, I'll update this review. I would highly recommend them...Edit;  after 6 weeks they won't accept a charge. Very disappointing because I really enjoyed these headphones..Edit: Mpow contacted me and offered to send me a new pair. Mine had quit charging but after pairing them with my son's iPhone,  they started charging again.  I was told to keep both pairs for the trouble.  Great customer service and thought I'd throw out the possible fix if someone had trouble getting a charge and still had a little bit of power to their headphones",18
5.0,Great battery life and sound quality,"December 4, 2018",Yes,Absolutely love these headphones!  You could either spend $300 for a pair of Beats or get these for a fraction of the price. Sound quality is excellent and they really block out noise. I could not be happier.,0
5.0,Great headphones!,"April 15, 2018",Yes,"Easy set up with Bluetooth. There is also a cord to do a direct plug in if needed (like for the inflight video). Though these aren’t noise cancelling, they still do some cancelling because they are over the ear and well made. Amazing price and great product!",0
5.0,Great earphones for bluetooth listening to music on cell phone without bothering others.,"May 9, 2018",Yes,"Good quality, does everything I wanted in a complete ear cover head phone.  The tap buttons on the outside of the ear pads makes it easy to use. Came a day earlier than promised.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.",0
5.0,Glasses wearers will appreciate its comfort plus good sound quality!,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"These work like a charm. Good noise cancel, good sound overall, isnt the loudest but its got enough power to satisfy your needs unless you seriously wanna not hear anything at all for a while. The important aspect for me is that i wear glasses and these are super comfy even with them on. Maybe after around 5-6 hours you start to feel slight irritation but theyre honestly worth the money",1
1.0,One Star,"October 31, 2017",Yes,They broke in one week,2
4.0,Amazing price!,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"I've really enjoyed a bluetooth function on these headphones, as well as the noise isolating. The sound quality is great and it's functional to transport around in a backpack...The headphones, when worn for a long time, does hurt my head. I have to take it off for a minute before wearing it again. The bluetooth doesn't work on my phone; I needed to delete the bluetooth connection because it kept trying to connect and disconnect. Other than that, the headphones are really great and functional, especially for the price.",0
4.0,Great value,"August 22, 2018",Yes,"I got these for my college freshman. She doesn't like the way my Bose QC2s fit on her her ears...I got bonus points for ordering the pink ones...And she reports that they're comfortable, sound great, and the Bluetooth paired nicely with her iPhone. She's super happy with the add-on case...Happy kid for half the cost of other similar headphones...Holding off on the fifth star to see how they last...",0
4.0,"Great price, don't sound great at low volume","November 30, 2018",Yes,I have had these for over six months and use them frequently. I wish it was a bit easier to toggle between my pc and phone. The sound quality suffers at low volumes or high ambient noise. Good value overall.,0
5.0,Great Headphones!!!!!,"November 2, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are great! The sound quality is great. They get decently loud. They are fairly light weight and very comfortable. They have a long battery life, and the Bluetooth has an impressive range. They also come in my favorite color which is a bonus.",0
4.0,Nice headphones....wish they had more noise reduction capabilities.,"October 21, 2017",Yes,These are nice headphones but they do not quiet the exterior noise as much as I'd hoped.  I was planning to use them at work with no music playing to block out some co-worker's singing (sigh).....but I can still hear her!  Maybe I just need to get the nerve to tell her to sing quieter.  :(,0
5.0,"Excellent buy! Great price, great quality. Clear phone calls","May 8, 2018",Yes,Best wireless bluetooth headphones ive probably ever owned.Great sound quality for music.Great sound quality for phone calls.

Thank you so much!!!..Loved it so much I bought 2 but one blew a speaker out 2 weeks after getting it. The other is working like a charm.",1
4.0,good product broke but they sent me a new one,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"Pretty good but the side button sometimes comes off, but otherwise good sound and I like the Bluetooth. Not completely noise canceling but good enough. They saw my review and realized that my headphone was broke and sent me one no cost to me and although I didn't know they were gonna do that, that was REAL customer service and gets an extra star.",0
5.0,Great range and charge life!,"November 18, 2017",Yes,So far so good... very pleased.  Quick delivery as usual and the product is working great!!!.Range is phenomenal -- i can go all over the house and still receive from laptop and phone in my office.charge lasted over 1 week with moderate to heavy use -- 20+ hours...,0
5.0,"Great headphones for the price point, battery charge lasts a long time, ear cups are a little snugger vs other over-ears..","July 9, 2018",Yes,"Great headphones for the price point. Battery charge lasts a long time. The ear cups are a little smaller than other over ear head phones, but I have a big head (I am 6' 2"" ). Would buy again, and I definitely recommend. Just as good as my Sony's that were 4 x the price.",0
5.0,Super comfortable and good sound quality,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. I've never been an over-ear headphone kind of girl since they often give me headaches - I have not had that problem with these. The sound quality is very good, but I would have preferred a more active noise-cancelling feature. Sound quality is better when using the aux cable, but I prefer the convenience of being unwired. I highly recommend these!",0
5.0,Great sound,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"Love the sound from this bluetooth headphones. The charge lasts awhile and when you dp have to charge them, it charges quickly. They fold up and it comes with it's own bag to store it in.",0
4.0,Overall good headphones for the price,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"The first week i had them they heated up and my ears got pretty hot, but it was just a one time deal. The hinge that allows the headphones to fold in popped out but I pushed it back in and as long as I'm kinda careful then it's not an issue, but other then that i havnt had any other problems. But the sound and comfort are better then I expected",0
5.0,Great for the price,"July 13, 2017",Yes,I am using the headphones to watch movies while I run in the treadmill and I connect them to my computer using the cable.  The sound is great.  I haven't used the Bluetooth features so I wouldn't know if it works well.  I find them light weight and that they do isolate the noise.  I like them so far!,0
5.0,Fantastic sound and bass,"May 17, 2018",Yes,"Amazing sound, great bass, just another amazing product from mpow...Ive been an a/v tech for about 10 years now and mpow just never fails to impress with all of there products. Full volume no driver floats no distortion...Truly cannot beat these headsets for the price...Keep up the great work mpow!",0
5.0,Good Sound Quality,"January 4, 2018",Yes,"Purchased for my daughter after husband received them as a gift. They seem to hold up well for him, so hoping they will hold up well for my teenaged daughter. Easy to pair with her phone. Excellent color and true to picture. Sound quality seems excellent for the price.",0
5.0,"The battery life is also amazing, as i can go a few days or ...","August 1, 2017",Yes,"I usually just use iPhone headphones but always lose or break them. Decided to buy something a bit bulkier, stronger so they would last. Was slightly skeptical due to the low price but the reviews convinced me. I have used these for a few months now and they show no signs of wear. The sound quality is phenomenal, whether your listening to podcasts or music. I often wear these while cleaning or throwing clay, so there are no cords in the way. The battery life is also amazing, as i can go a few days or heavy use without recharging. If you are debating buying these, just do it. You will not regret it.",0
5.0,Great quality headphones for the price,"December 1, 2017",Yes,"Great pair of headphones for the price. They are comfortable on your head and ears. They block out a lot of outside sound and they stay charged throughout the day. These were purchased for my 12 year old son who can be careless sometimes with his things. These definitely will last him..I always read reviews when making online purchases, but don’t usually leave my own review. I feel these headphones were worth a review for the price and quality I receieved.",0
5.0,... WAY OVERPRICED and I was hoping these would be good. They are great,"May 17, 2018",Yes,"Bought these because Beatz are just WAY OVERPRICED and I was hoping these would be good..They are great! Not only did I love my pair, I bought a pair for my boyfriend too. We have been using them for 4 months now and both love them. Can’t beat the price!",0
3.0,They’ll play music and connect...,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Great for what you’re paying for, but they are basically speakers around your head, like if i have my music slightly passed the middle point on my volume, the whole library will be listening. So to tune out, yes, conveniently considerate of it’s environment, no. A serious pair of headphones they are not.",1
5.0,Better thanmy Beats.,"November 14, 2018",Yes,This is actually my second purchase of these headphones. I've owned Bluetooth Beats and these are better for hundreds less. Nice sound. Long lasting battery. Quick charge.,1
2.0,"Best for music, not gaming","September 11, 2018",Yes,"Sound has quite a delay when using it for gaming purposes.  The sound quality is also pretty distorted.  I'm sure for music, it would be fine but they market it as a multi-use item...and it is not.",0
5.0,"Great Battery, Independent Volume, Slightly Flat Sound - Great Value for Price!","February 6, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable resting on my head for hours if needed, has great battery life! The volume control on this operates independently from the device you've paired it with, which has the Pro of allowing more nuanced control, and the Con of it being somewhat slow to make big volume changes all at once...Sound is a little flat - not bassy, but that's when comparing it to a top-of-the-line brand that costs 5x-10x more. For the price, this is a great value!",0
5.0,Not the best wireless product on Amazon,"November 14, 2017",Yes,"Im updating my review , cause Their customer service is very very high professional. They contacted me after my post and sent another model for free. The new pair of headphones is really good quality and lightweight. Its also very comfortable to wear..Thank you!!!",0
5.0,Nice for the Price,"December 17, 2017",Yes,"Long battery life, good sound quality, lightweight and comfortable. Seemingly decent range, though I don't usually wander far from my device while wearing them...I have *not* used the mic, so I can't give a review on that function. I only bought them for listening to music and reading/doing artwork on my tablet.",0
5.0,he says they are awesome and is taking better care of them than anything ...,"January 12, 2018",Yes,"My son bought these with his Christmas money for use with his Xbox. Now he wears them for every electronic thing he does - online classes, audio books, music.... he says they are awesome and is taking better care of them than anything before.",0
4.0,Reasonable quality and a very good price,"December 2, 2017",Yes,"Average sound, comfort and looks. Pairing was perhaps a little slower than a premium brand.  With my first purchase I had an issue with a button falling off one of the ear cups...Update: To the seller's credit, they have stood behind there product and sent a replacement.  So far so good.  At the end of the day I was looking for a reasonable quality headphone for out teenager, and think will meet our needs.",1
3.0,Not active noise cancelling head phones,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"I thought these were noise cancelling headphones. They are not. Don't let ""passive noise cancelling"" fool you. That means they are ear muffs and block some of the noise. Purchased these too quickly before realizing. They went back. Had to invest some big bucks to get the real deal.",0
5.0,Great choice!,"July 24, 2017",Yes,I've bought my young son about 6 different pairs of headphones so far and these are by far his favorite and most comfortable and he likes that he can walk around and still be connected.,1
5.0,Durability,"August 28, 2017",Yes,"I only use this for two weeks. With the type of headphones that fold over my old pair usually break easily but so far it seems alot more durable. Has metallic parts instead of plastic and hope the housing and the pin that folds the headphones are metal too so it last longer but can't tell. Blue tooth part was extremely easy to connect unlike some other types I bough .  Sound quality  is good as well. Definitely  getting alothe for th example price  Material to make headphones are like $15, beats are great but the mark up on those things are ridiculously over priced.",0
3.0,They are okay!,"December 6, 2017",Yes,"They work fine but the sound isn't great. The speakers sound a bit muffled to me, but for the price you get what you pay for. The bluetooth works fine on my laptop. These are just okay, better to save up for better quality.",1
5.0,I bought the second pair,"June 5, 2018",Yes,"Very good quality! I bought one for my son, and I like them so much so I bought one for me too now.",1
5.0,Excellent Headphones,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"Love these wireless headphones.  Easy to connect, and excellence fit. Sound quality is perfect.  Not much more to say.  If your thinking about buying headphones, don't hesitate.",0
5.0,These are great. I've worn them consistently for over a week ...,"December 14, 2017",Yes,"These are great. I've worn them consistently for over a week and still haven't charged them yet. I think there's a degree of ""noise bleeding"" where when I listen to music loudly those around me can hear it, but I'm overall pretty happy with these.",0
5.0,Best headphones for the money. Seriously.,"April 22, 2018",Yes,"I've had these things for over a year now. They've withstood a lot of sweat, water, and chalk. Dropped them several times. Sound quality is fantastic, and I use these primarily for the gym, and I only have to charge them about once every two weeks. The only thing ""bad"" I can say about them, is if you wear them over a hood, they will slide around a little.",0
5.0,and can fit the size of a normal size male like myself and my wife who is very petite,"June 11, 2017",Yes,"They fit very well, and can fit the size of a normal size male like myself and my wife who is very petite. Super comfortable, but not the best if you are going to be working out, since they can slide off a bit. However, just regular use they work very well, and the connectivity to the bluetooth on an apple phone is very good and long distance is good too.",0
5.0,Love these!,"May 18, 2017",Yes,I'm a big fan of these headphones! They are comfortable and deliver a good sound quality. I think they are good for phone calls too - I haven't had any complaints about the microphone quality.,1
5.0,Excellent choice,"May 2, 2018",Yes,I love these! Ear buds always fall out of my ears. These sound fantastic and are a great price.,1
4.0,For the price these are a good deal. No they don't have the sound quality ...,"September 6, 2017",Yes,For the price these are a good deal. No they don't have the sound quality of a bose but the batter life is very good. The sound quality isn't bad but somthimes when I'm on the phone the person on the other end will say it sounds like I'm alittle to far away from the mic,0
5.0,Great bang for your buck,"March 8, 2018",Yes,Love these headphones. Good for anything. I mainly use them at the gym or at the office (I clean them regularly so they don't smell like sweat so don't worry; my coworkers don't hate me)...Pros:.Battery life is fantastic.Sound is great. I owned a pair of Beats and had them stolen at the gym and was looking for a replacement so I bought these. Sounds pretty similar and they are about $180 cheaper so everyone wins here.Very comfortable..Cons:.I only have one pair of these,0
1.0,I bought a different one just to make sure that it's not my laptop and it worked just fine. Very disappointed,"January 8, 2018",Yes,"I bought this for work / business. I use the bluetooth to connect and skype for my meetings. However, people are telling me that they can't hear me or that my voice comes out as very faint. I have been trying to find out how to improve it or if there's anything else that I can do to improve. I bought a different one just to make sure that it's not my laptop and it worked just fine. Very disappointed.",1
1.0,Looking at some other reviews I'm hoping this is just some bad luck with a defective unit,"December 15, 2017",Yes,The mid range on the headset is overpowering and drowns out the music. Also the mic is horrendous. People I would speak with while using the headset all reported that they could barely hear me. I confirmed by using the iPhone voice recorder and it is barely audible. The mic performed just as poorly with the volume turned to the max level. Looking at some other reviews I'm hoping this is just some bad luck with a defective unit.,1
1.0,"No sync, no customer support to resolve","December 28, 2017",Yes,"We cant get these to sync with anything. Very disappointing, wasted more than 80 bucks on 2 useless items with no product support.",1
5.0,Great for netflix/ audiobook binging.,"July 18, 2017",Yes,"I can wear these all day. And do. They're great, and you can use them AS you're powering up, as long as you've got a long enough micro-USB to do it. So they're my official PC headphones. Nothing about them says, ""Take me to the gym!"" but they're great at the job that they're meant for.",0
4.0,pretty good. Sound isn't great - not a lot ...,"April 9, 2018",Yes,"For the price, pretty good.  Sound isn't great - not a lot of low end, but good for voice which is what I'm using it for.  Headset is a bit fatiguing after wearing them for an hour or more, I'm hoping the stretch out over time.",0
5.0,In love! Awesome value for the price,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are GREAT!!! They are the only ones thus far that do not hurt my ears! I can go hours at a time with them on and forget they are even there. Sound quality is great, comes with protective baggy to store them in. Very happy with my purchase!",0
4.0,Worth it,"August 30, 2017",Yes,"very comfortable...easy to use...mid-range sounds good, not so much for hi &amp; lo end but definitely worth  the money...UPDATE:  Since the original review I am upgrading to 4 stars.  Quality of sound improved when used with 2 other devices, attributing the original a poor BT connection not the fault of the headphones.",0
5.0,They work great!,"December 4, 2018",Yes,Wanted to get a cheap set of Bluetooth headphones that I could leave in my truck for when I needed them. These have far exceeded my expectations. Recommend to everyone.,0
5.0,but they had good reviews so I thought I'd give it a shot,"February 15, 2018",Yes,"I was skeptical by the price of these headphones, but they had good reviews so I thought I'd give it a shot. I LOVE them! I've used them with my MacBook Pro and with my iPhone 7 Plus and they connected flawlessly and sound great. I plan on buying a second pair to keep one at work and one at home.",0
4.0,I do like these and use them daily,"December 25, 2017",Yes,"I do like these and use them daily. The sound is a bit off. It is as if the audio is coming from far away.  Slightly flat. Also, I wanted to use them for a passenger in my car to listen to radio, while I listened to my book on tape from cell phone (illegal to wear headphones in my state while driving). Not able to do this. Bummer.",0
5.0,BEST HEADPHONE UNDER $100,"September 1, 2018",Yes,Why buy a $200 headphone when you can get great quality for $40...?.This is one of the best headphones I’ve ever own. I’ll be getting one for everyone I know for Christmas.,0
4.0,Good headphones and customer service,"November 8, 2017",Yes,I really liked my headphones. I use them everyday. I love that I can put them on and drown out the world with music. After about a month my wireless chip must have gone faulty. I contacted the company and they responded very quickly. They were really great in helping me get them returned to them and getting another pair out to me! I liked them so much my husband got a pau and he really likes his as well.,0
5.0,Great Headphones for The Price,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"Alright! Have has these for a few months now and really dig them. For the price they have good sound quality and pair well. I like the functions on the side of the ear. Overall great value, did a lot of research and happy I landed on these.",0
5.0,Best of the lot,"September 18, 2017",Yes,"It is far superior to both of the headsets I have purchased for durability (that may also be the weak point of this set), for comfort and ease of adjustment. The length of use of the battery may also be an issue, being only about two hours. That said, take a chance and buy it.",0
5.0,We love them the build is great they feel great on ...,"January 24, 2018",Yes,My wife and I got these to use while on the treadmill or around the house when you want to listen hands free while doing domestic tasks. We love them the build is great they feel great on your head the olny con is that they are a little bassy other than that just fine we would by them again and maybe we will so that we have 2 pair.,0
5.0,Found what I needed it for.,"May 31, 2017",Yes,I needed a headset to go with a portable DVD player.  This is was I was wanting.  Even tho my DVD player isn't Bluetooth it has the cord.  I did par it up with my phone which works great.  But will just use it for the DVD player.  It has great sound. I don't have anything bad to say about it.,0
5.0,"Don’t buy Beats for kids, nice cheaper alternative","August 19, 2018",Yes,Just got these for my daughter.  Didn’t want to spend $$$ on Beats.  She said they sound great and the wireless range is awesome.  Can’t comment on durability yet. Hopefully they last!,0
5.0,Battery lasts pretty long.,"March 19, 2018",Yes,I love these headphones. I’ve had them for over a month now and I haven’t had to charge them yet! I go to the gym 6 days a week and stay there for about 1.5 hours. They stay on my head despite any jumping that I do. The sound quality is good and the volume goes up pretty high.  They are pretty sturdy as well. I’m a very clumsy person and I drop or bump them frequently. I don’t go far from my phone when using them but a couple of times when I’ve walked pretty far away on accident I noticed the range is pretty good.,0
5.0,Good choice!,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"I've only had these a couple of days but so far, I really like them and I've had many headsets!.I'm adding to my review. Now I've had these for about a month.

5.0,The sound quality is very good. I use them for phone calls as well ...,"February 17, 2018",Yes,"Not being one to drop big dough on another popular brand of headphones, I thought I’d give these a try..The sound quality is very good. I use them for phone calls as well and the microphone is clear.",1
5.0,but my first impressio of it is great. Connected no problem,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"Just got it, but my first impressio of it is great. Connected no problem, simple operation, fits me well and cancels out moderate sound at around 80% of my volume bar on my phone. Sound quality is great for $40, I'd say even for $60.",0
4.0,Good sound quality and seems to have long battery life,"March 27, 2018",Yes,"Good sound quality and seems to have long battery life. The buttons on the side are a little cheap and sometimes confusing to navigate to change volume, turn on/ off, pair, etc. Otherwise happy to save a lot compared to name brand headphones!",0
5.0,Great wireless headphones at a really good price.,"July 30, 2018",Yes,"My son is very happy with these headphones.  He was able to pair them right up to his iPhone 6s Plus and said they have really good range, better than his sisters Sony XB950's.  So far, very good.",0
5.0,Good battery life,"October 23, 2018",Yes,"I still haven’t had to charge after 20 ish hours of use over the last 2 weeks. It manages to block out a good amount of noise. Almost all office noise, about a quarter to a half of airplane engine noise. More if you listen to music too.",0
5.0,I would recommend these headphones to others,"March 12, 2018",Yes,I'm pretty impressed with these headphones for the price.  I think the noise cancelling could be a little better.  The sound quality and noise cancelling isn't as good as a 12 year old set of Bose headphones but the price is right.,0
5.0,"Comfortable, good sound, good construction","June 20, 2018",Yes,"Very nice headphones for this price. Bought these for my son, so they are not my primary headphones, but they are perfect for him and the sound is quite good. Controls work perfectly, and the build quality is very sturdy but light.",0
3.0,Good Except the Bluetooth Doesn't Work,"February 26, 2018",Yes,"These are very comfortable to wear and the sound is good, but they do not hold a charge which has made setting up Bluetooth impossible. Unfortunately, I waited too long and now I can't send them back.",1
5.0,It is very nicely designed and inexpensive.,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"The voice prompts and wink lights help a lot. The most important feature for me are the comfortable, sound-blocking ear cushions. If brain rattling hi-fi is less important you will be delighted. It is very nicely designed and sturdy for the low price range.",0
4.0,Nice bluetooth headphones for the price.,"November 10, 2017",Yes,"Good quality for the price. The bass isn't incredible, but its there. The audio is quality, no distortion and the headphones themselves are comfortable and stylish. I love how they fold up and the side controls for song change and volume adjustment.",0
5.0,Superb Sound!,"August 12, 2017",Yes,Great sound for the price..I have (2) Beats by Dre which costs alot money..I prefer using this headset over the Beats. Battery lasts along and the sound is superb. I used them for my radio show everyday and for flying on airplanes.,1

I’m really happy with the headphones and highly recommend it.,0
4.0,Great sound!,"February 11, 2018",Yes,(written by 13 yr old) Bluetooth feature words great.  Sound is really good. When you have them on they are comfortable to your ears/head.  I give it four stars because when you want to sync to your device (using the pause/play button on the headphones) it doesn't seem to work right away.,0
5.0,Good product for the price !,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"I bought as a gift for my daughter, she linked it up to her PS3 and plays with her fiends online. She wears them everywhere, even to school. (I’m surprised they let her wear them there ) but she definitely loves it. (She’s 12) I cannot give more details about sound quality or batt life because I haven’t personally used the product, but she hasn’t told me anything bad about it.",0
5.0,most definitely the very best headphones for the money,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"by far, most definitely the very best headphones for the money, the fit on your head is perfect and the sound is incredible. i had bought $59.00 headphones for myself, and giving my Mpow's  to my sister in law, after a couple of days i had to returned them because the sound wouldn't compare to the Mpow's.",0
5.0,Very comfortable headphones.,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"These were just the type of headphones  I’ve been looking for. The price was right, they are comfortable, and they fold. Love the red color. I am basically using them to listen to my audio books, so music was not of great importance on my list.",0
4.0,These headphones have really good sound quality,"December 10, 2017",Yes,"These headphones have really good sound quality, especially for the price. They are over ear and get uncomfortable after a couple of hours. When on Bluetooth, they flash a blue light every five seconds or so which is quite irritating and distracting. All of the sudden one side doesn't work. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they are cheap and good sound quality.",0
5.0,"Battery last a long time, SOUND QUALITY ARE GREAT! Too.","October 4, 2018",Yes,"I was sceptical at first, for its price? Are you kidding me? But WoW! They Deliver big time. The other Review that was 5? Its true. I am Glad i bought this product. Thanks!",0

4.0,I like them for what I got them for,"April 7, 2018",Yes,"I like them for what I got them for. They are not the loudest headphones but they will do. The wireless function works well and the built-in mic works good as well. Also, the battery life is pretty good. The reason I gave them a four-star rating, is that they just are ok for music. But that is not why I bought them.",0
5.0,Battery life is awesome!,"April 20, 2018",Yes,"If you're looking for a everyday gym headphone set, this is the one. Bluetooth capability is perfect. Battery (on one charge) lasts over 30-40 gym sessions (45 minutes per)..It's not nose quality (sorry to say), but you get way more than you pay for.",0
5.0,Awesome Headphones For The Money,"August 6, 2018",Yes,Out of the box playing music from Padora seamed flat until I installed an EQ on my cell and tuned the freq. to my liking.

5.0,Great sound for under $100,"January 21, 2018",Yes,"Great sound for under $100, comfy on the ears, easy to pack, connects to iPhone with no issue (I originally had a faulty pair which had a scratchy sound coming from the mic and the company replaced the set quickly).

5.0,Great quality headphones at an unbeatable price,"December 8, 2017",Yes,I original had beats headphones and they got stepped on and broken. I decided I couldn't afford to keep getting high quality head phones if they weren't going to last and this pair had great reviews. Well it was more than worth it for the price! I bought the hard case with it which is a little bulky for travel but overall a great set of headphones and I can barely tell the difference between them and my beats! I highly recommend this product.,0
5.0,I would recommend them,"January 11, 2018",Yes,"My kid bought a pair of these and liked them so I figured I'd give them a try.  I like that they are light weight and the sound quality is perfect for what I'm using them for. I wear them at work and I use to use ear buds, but I have people coming up to me to ask questions and it bugged me to have to remove them when I got a good seal.  So now its no problem.",0
3.0,Reviews of these headphones are great! Looking forward to giving them for Christmas gifts,"December 10, 2017",Yes,"Description of item said a pouch for storage was included. There was none. You offered me a rebate and I accepted it. Some days later, I purchased another set for my other grandson. The description still said there was a pouch included. There was no pouch with the second pair. You need to take that out of the product description..Reviews of these headphones are great! Looking forward to giving them for Christmas gifts!!",1
4.0,A company that stands behind their product!,"March 8, 2017",Yes,"As of now it would not even get a star. The product stopped working after two uses. Pretty bummed out because I thought this was going to be a good product. Now I have to return it and no headphones for my workouts..So I am adding to this review because their customer service is absolutely awesome and they read my review and must have felt my dissatisfaction with the product's durability. However after having the product for a bit now, it is an awesome pair of headphones, with great sound and fit.",6
4.0,For the price these are amazing! The comfort for them is great around the ...,"March 22, 2018",Yes,For the price these are amazing! The comfort for them is great around the ears and the buttons look and feel natural. They are not heavy either...The only change I would want is to have more bass in them. It's kinda weak.,0
5.0,best sound and fit,"April 18, 2018",Yes,i bought this over the ear headphones and i got to say i love them best fitting headphones i have ever bought. the sound is so good i am a runner and like to jump on my trampoline with my music and they stay right in place. i so recommend this par of headphones to anyone,0
5.0,Decent headphones. Outstanding customer service.,"October 12, 2018",Yes,"After about 9 months of careful (daily use, at my desk) use, the cushioning is coming apart. It's really too bad, because the sound quality and battery life are decent...UPDATE:.Stellar customer service. They completely took care of me, even initiating on their end. For the price, can’t beat them.",0
5.0,Five Stars,"April 25, 2018",Yes,Product was received in good condition. Still trying to pair the headphones with my smart TV..,1
5.0,... headphones that wouldn't cost a lot but would sound good. Well these headphones did the job,"December 19, 2017",Yes,"I just got these for myself because I wanted some headphones that wouldn't cost a lot but would sound good. Well these headphones did the job. they are great!!! I was able pair them very easy to my phone and they sound good...The only thing I would say is there was a buzzing noise for a short while in the middle of one of my songs, but it went away fairly fast. As of now I love these things.",1
4.0,Really cool,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"Love these head phones! They look great, portable, durable, and the sound is out of this world. Just wish the battery would last longer. Overall wonderful product!",0
4.0,Nice headphones for the money,"January 2, 2018",Yes,Nice headphones for the money. Fit well with a very firm hold on your head. Keeps the sound in your headphones and it’s hard to hear what’s playing when your around someone with them on.,1
5.0,5 stars,"January 15, 2018",Yes,Great headphones. My son loves them. Wish they connected to the tv but I think his tv is too old for the size adaptor. But they're great. They get loud and cancel out enough noise for me to tell him to turn them down because he doesn't answer when I call.,0
3.0,Ugh,"August 5, 2018",Yes,Bought 2 pair based on reviews. I listened to both pair to be certain.  I'll be giving them away. Sound quality mediocre at best. Very little low bass if any.  Mid bass is over pronounced to the point of mid-range/vocal break-up. It would appear that the driver was either borrowed from or designed for an open back setup.,1
5.0,"Caution: do not buy for your husband, he'll swear to God he can't hear you","February 27, 2018",Yes,"My husband would rate these 5 stars. I bought them for him for christmas, and he hasn't taken them off yet. I, however, would rate them 0 stars if he could. These are noise cancelling headphones, and I swear he hasn't listented to a thing I've said since I bought them for him.",0
1.0,Will crack and break,"April 20, 2018",Yes,"So these headphones are wonderful, except that they don't last.  I've had them for a few months and I'm sorry to say that the plastic doesn't last. The curved band at the top will crack and break, rendering these headphones useless.",0
5.0,"When the headphones are plugged in, the sound is ...","July 8, 2018",Yes,"When the headphones are plugged in, the sound is muffled. I can't use them anymore, and they aren't exactly cheap...UPDATE: The manufacturer sent me a new pair of headphones, and after using them this weekend on my flight I can say that they help up! The sound is wonderful, no crackling noise!!",0
5.0,Same Quality as Beats!,"November 23, 2017",Yes,"Turning them off and on is annoying, but they do the same as beats headphones for 1/8 the price (I have a pair of both). They're perfect for the gym because there's not as much risk of them being stolen..They are slightly bulky, but fit great!",0
5.0,Well made headset,"October 11, 2018",Yes,"Exactly what I needed! So easy to use, sound is incredible, fits very comfortable over the ears, and makes my husband happy when I watch tv at night in bed, and he doesn’t hear it😀",0
5.0,I really like these headphones the pads are quite comfortable. Buy them!,"March 22, 2018",Yes,I really like these headphones the pads are quite comfortable and the sound is good. They’re a little snug on my fat head after an hour or two but they’re brand new and I think they’ll probably loosen up a little.,0
3.0,Just okay,"March 10, 2017",Yes,"This is an edit, I realized it was my phone setting, not volume for headphones.  Received the product on time, nicely packaged.  The headphones feel ""cheap"", but are user friendly.  They feel a bit heavy after an hour or so, the hunt for the perfect lightweight headphone continues.  These are okay though.",14
4.0,Good for professional and leisure use.,"June 29, 2017",Yes,"I have tried multiple Bluetooth headsets over the last few years, both over ear and in ear. The Mpow Bluetooth headset works very well compared to those. The audio quality is good for both watching streaming videos as well as for joining conference calls.",2
4.0,Good headphones for the price on sale. Little to no Bass.,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"I bought these when they were on sale, and for the price they are a great headphone. I will say that there is very little to no bass on these headphones. They do have pretty good seal on the ears so that you can't really hear anything around you. Would buy again, but not if I'm looking for headphones with really good bass.",1
5.0,Very comfortable headphones!,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"Wonderful earphones! Just returned from a trip across the world and I wore them continuously for about 9 hours at one point with no discomfort. They fold up nicely, have great ""surround"" sound, and block out a good deal of outside noise. I actually like that they're not noise-cancelling, because the hum of noise cancelling phones gives me a headache. Plus, they look great too!",0
5.0,Better than other brand I bought a few months ago for similar price price.,"April 23, 2017",Yes,"Needed a 2nd set of headphones.  Decided to purchase a different brand this time.  These are much better than the brand I purchased a few momths ago at a similar price.  Easy to operate.  Holds a charge all day.  Plug in or use bluetooth.  Great sound.  They fold for easy transport.  A little heavier, but more padding in the ear area and sturdier.",0
5.0,Bass,"February 16, 2018",Yes,"My boyfriend actually bought a pair first and I happened to end up enjoying the bass, sound quality, and feel of the product. I am a major music person when it comes down to the quality of my headphones! Absolutely would buy again for the price!..Update 3 weeks from my delivery date lol this is my first time having to charge my headphones since the day I got it! Battery life goes on forever!",0
5.0,A Great Product,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"Purchased these for my son for Christmas, and he loves them! I've tried them out myself, and loved them. They feel and sound like a high quality product. I'm thinking about getting a pair for myself when I'm working out.",0
5.0,Pre-teen approved,"January 11, 2018",Yes,Bought these for an 11 year old to use for gaming and he was thrilled! He tells me they look cool and he loves how they are wireless and have a built in microphone. I love that they aren't completely sound proof so he can still hear me talking to him when he has them on! They fit him comfortably and seem to be high quality and durable as well.,0
5.0,Great deal,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"I received the headphones the other day and have been very happy with this product.  They are very comfortable and easy to control, they come with a nice velvet bag for protection and the headset is foldable for easy storage.  I could not believe how much sound could be heard and the quality is amazing.  I love that they are also Blue Tooth.  I am very impressed and the price is great for this product.  I highly recommend it.",0
5.0,Great headphones! Easy setup and great sound for cheap,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"Blown away so far. Great sound for the price, comfortable, easy to pair with phones and connects quickly. If these last two years, they should get 6 stars. The price is low and the quality is high. Great for the gym if ear buds aren't comfortable.",0
5.0,Manufacturers Replaced Product,"March 20, 2018",Yes,We are just outside the Amazon warranty these headphones have crapped out. Is there anyone that makes decent headp** update The manufacture has replaced the headphones and replacement is working better than the original ones.,0
5.0,Best bang for your buck,"August 19, 2017",Yes,"Best headphones on the market for the price. Incredible sound! Very rich, nice mix of highs and bass... loud, too. Battery lasts so long, and haven't had them run out in an inopportune moment. Usually charge them every few days, and use them several hours a day. Recommend!",0
5.0,They seem to be pretty nice though,"December 25, 2017",Yes,"My wife likes them so far. I had to wait until Christmas to review these, as they were a gift. They seem to be pretty nice though. I'm impressed with the quality packaging and that they come with a travel pouch. I hope the product quality is as good as we anticipate!",0
3.0,"They're good for the price, but...","April 16, 2018",Yes,"Not comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, the sound quality is just ok",1
1.0,Sad customer,"May 12, 2018",Yes,Update review: I only had these headphones for 2 months and the head cushion part just came apart. And I really loved these headphones now I have to figure out how to fix or buy new headphones. Sad right now 😕,0
4.0,Good headphones!,"September 7, 2017",Yes,"Sound quality is good for the price, and setup was very easy. They feel pretty sturdy. The earpieces seal over your ears effectively enough to block most outside sound while listening to music. They've been great for studying and improving my focus when background noise is an issue.",0
5.0,Gets the job done,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"I'm not a huge audiophile but this sounds good, feels comfortable, and hasn't had a problem with accidental activation that a previous pair of bluetooth headphones I had did.",0

They are very comfortable, the sound is clear. I watch TV with them on so I don't miss what is being said and I don't disturb anyone by having the TV sound turned up loud.",0
5.0,These headphones are fantastic. I've been using them for about 3 months ...,"July 4, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are fantastic. I've been using them for about 3 months now. They are a little tight on the head, but the Bluetooth feature and the sound quality are great. I have been using them while I play PS4 (won't connect to the Bluetooth however), making phone calls, and listening to music. Also, it is nice how they are rechargeable (unlike previous headphones I've had) and the battery life has been great (I have only recharged it once since I got them; I use them almost every day of the week).",0
5.0,Excellent Service,"July 15, 2018",Yes,I had a problem with my first headset. It was replaced immediately without question. I like the headset. It's comfortable and I can listen to media without disturbing the rest of my family.,0
5.0,Great buy,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"Good sound, (looks good), easy to use and very comfortable. And inexpensive! What more do you want? I have tried several other brands of low-cost Bluetooth ear phones, and they all have developed linking issues. Had these a few months and still working just fine.Just bought another pair!",0
4.0,Great deal for the money,"October 25, 2017",Yes,My headset arrived on time and in perfect condition .  The headset paired with my iPhone 8 Plus very easily and has a great sound quality .. My only complaint with the headset is that they will not pair with my PS4 completely wireless .  Using the adapter cable that came with the set I am able to play my PS4 and the sound quality during the game is outstanding I would recommend this Bluetooth headset to any of my friends .,0
5.0,Wonderful!!,"July 11, 2017",Yes,"I really like these headphones!  The ease of pairing my iPhone to them was appreciated. I love the fact that I can hear them over the mower. They cancel out the outside noise better than any other headphones I used. Very happy with these and they didn't ""break the bank"" price wise.",1
5.0,Headphones,"September 13, 2018",Yes,"I bought these earphones for my younger son. So far so good, they have held up with him using them. I haven’t had them long enough to grade battery life. But the build quality and  material is good.",0
1.0,Bought these a few days ago. Charged them out ...,"December 13, 2017",Yes,Bought these a few days ago.  Charged them out of the box for about 5 hours and do not work. I then left them charging overnight and still the indicator light shows red.  Very little in the instruction manual and a quick look through the questions and 'answers' shows dozens of people with the same issue.,1
5.0,built to last love them...,"September 7, 2017",Yes,"Love them just a little tight bc my head is huge.... I use them every day at the gym. I'm a gym rat but still got belly fat....seriously ""Great"" product you don't get that anymore in this country everyone is trying to get one over on you. I have two sets of beats which costs me near 400 each. One beat set which I keep in my leisure car stop breathing. So I went on Amazon and found these. Wow I save 350.00 buckaroos....  A thanka juuuu china lub u product....",0
5.0,These work well. My only issue is how short ...,"July 10, 2018",Yes,These work well. My only issue is how short the aux cable is.

5.0,"Great quality sound, dad loves them","September 18, 2018",Yes,"Got these for my dad after he cried when he broke the $100 headphones I got for his birthday two years ago, tripping on the cord.

5.0,I really love these headphones,"April 13, 2018",Yes,"I really love these headphones. I didn’t think I would, considering the price. Yet, they fit nicely and the sound is great. The blue tooth connection works seamlessly every time. They keep a charge like a boss.",0

5.0,Great Headphone,"January 5, 2018",Yes,"We have Dish and it has been difficult to find a head phone that will work without spending $100. This one works great, is less than half the price of the recommended one and is easier to adjust the volume. I am very happy with this product.",0
5.0,I’m no audiophile but I really like these headphones,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"I’m no audiophile but I really like these headphones. I love how it's Bluetooth enabled, and how it’s also normal headphones with a 3.5mm input. My favorite part is that it doesn’t require a charge to operate as normal wired.",0
4.0,Disappointed,"October 11, 2018",Yes,I don’t usually do reviews but I think people should know what they are ordering. Nice sound but they keep shutting down and not turning back on. Thought maybe it was not charged but after an overnight charge it still a problem. Just a heads up. “””Update””” they sent me a new pair an they work fine.

5.0,I love how big these are,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"I love how big these are. The design is cool looking. They also work very well, even through other rooms. The charge lasts a good amount of time for me. I like the voice confirming that they are connected/disconnected to the phone, and powered off. The padding is super comfortable even over my glasses. I wish the control buttons weren't all so flat. They all feel very similar to each other so it takes a bit to feel out which button is the one I want.",0
5.0,Five Stars,"May 4, 2018",Yes,Very good sound and blue tooth range. Comfortable with a long last battery,1
4.0,Solid value and comfort,"September 20, 2017",Yes,"Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, holds charge well, sound is a 4 on 5 point scale, microphone works great (folks can hear me).

5.0,Reasonable choice.,"June 16, 2018",Yes,"Got the 059 to replace a beats set that croaked. From my point of view this set works every bit as  well, connects to my devices w/o any problems, sound quality and volume is quite good.",0
5.0,Great Deal Overall.,"October 11, 2017",Yes,"I have had these headphones for about 2 months, and I can not tell you how nice it is to have Bluetooth in a headset. The battery life is amazing for the price; I can still not find out where they put the damn battery because it's so light. The included bag is nice if you like to keep it from getting scratched. These are very tough; I put the thing through hell and back showing me that they put quality into their products. All in all, I would totally recommend these headphones for the amazing price, above average sound quality, and amazing durability.",0

5.0,Get them while they're still available,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"This is a fantastic product. I take them to the gym and I wear them around the house when I'm working.  I listen to music from my phone.  You never miss a phone call They sound great and they're not cumbersome.  For the price, you don't have to worry about misplacing them.  I'm very happy with them.",0
5.0,Amazing,"January 31, 2018",Yes,Easy to set up. Great headphones. And the battery life is awesome. I've been using these for about 2 months now for about and hour a day at the gym and I have only charged them once since the first initial charge when I bought them.,0
5.0,Paired right up to my apple tv box.,"March 6, 2018",Yes,Works great.  Paired right up to my apple tv box so I can watch tv at night without keeping my wife up.  Great deal.  Not great for music but still pretty good for the price. They are pretty comfortable as well.,0

The pairing process was pretty easy and they can pair with both my iPhone and iPad with minimal issue, something my last pair of Bluetooth headphones did not do.

The others hurt her head if she had them on too long.  They are comfortable, the sound quality is very good. They have a very long range.

4.0,Very comfortable and good sound,"January 4, 2018",Yes,"Very comfortable and good sound. Lasts for hours on a single charge. Only drawback is when you use for phone calls the other party can barely hear you so there’s an issue with the built in mic. Other than that, these are a great value.",0

3.0,"They are ok, for backup headphones......","September 13, 2017",Yes,"Not at all what I was expecting, hardly no bass what so ever. But between sound quality, presentation, and overall feel of the headphones, they fit very comfortably. I am giving this product a 3-Star rating. So with that being said I will keep them for a back up set.",0
5.0,Good purchase,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality is great. There is a central button on the headphone that turns them on/off and controls Bluetooth pairing which causes me to sometimes have to cycle through multiple times (on,off,pairing etc )to get to the desired function.",0

I love them just as much as I loved my Beats. The only problem I have is the sound is not the greatest when I am using them as a Bluetooth headset for my phone. I am fine with that since I mainly bought these to listen to music anyway. I would highly recommend this product! Work just as great as a $300 pair for way less money!,0
5.0,Excellent Buy,"July 5, 2018",Yes,"Excellent sound and battery life.  Playback buttons don't seem to work well with my PC, but I'm fairly certain that's a problem with my computer, not the headphones.  Amazing value.",0

4.0,Great value,"August 3, 2018",Yes,"Great value and sound. I am a sucker for these highly rated and others like these. Quality build, but not as much fidelity as the Criacr that I just received also. Mainly use these for mowing 5 acres every week. My top of the line Bose model has more wind noise than these. Fit is perfect.",0
4.0,"Good sound/build quality, but ear cups are a tad small","March 24, 2018",Yes,"I'm very happy with the sound quality and the build quality is excellent.

3.0,Good for kids,"June 17, 2017",Yes,"Decent sound quality for the price. Ear cups are small, better for children. About an hour is my limit. Don't care for the Voice Prompts when unit is turned Off/On/Pairing. Half the price of my Cowin ANC E7s, but perfect for when my grandkids come over and bring their games that I don't want to hear.",0
5.0,"A stroke of bad luck, but they took care of it ASAP","October 11, 2017",Yes,"I was at first unfortunate enough to receive a defective pair, but the seller was EXTREMELY quick in getting back to me about the issue. I sincerely appreciate them sending me a working pair, which I'm happy to report I've had no problems with thus far. The sound quality is great, earmuffs extremely comfortable (just avoid wearing earrings that would, of course, make it an awkward fit), and I don't have to worry about disturbing others while I play my music to my heart's content. The headphones are great, but the quick customer service and initiative are what I'd say earned the 5 star in my book.",0
5.0,... out and I can honestly say that they were nice piece of equipment,"July 2, 2017",Yes,"I use the headphones when working out and I can honestly say that they were nice piece of equipment.

The quality is much more than I expected for $35.00.  They look sharp in the red and black and the sound, to me is amazing!!  Great bass and percussion tones that I was missing completely from my laptop speakers.  Pairing took less than a minute to my HP Windows 10 Laptop and I did NOT need a Bluetooth adapter.  These are also very comfortable to wear as well.  Very, Very Satisfied!!",0

5.0,Best Buy I’ve had! Better than my Beats!,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"I can’t believe the quality of these bad boys, what is insane is they rock just as hard as my Beats! For a fraction of the cost. I’ll never go back to buying $250 Beats again! Quality of the material is almost exactly the same as well.",0
5.0,"Great sound, Great look.","January 12, 2018",Yes,Bought these for my youngest son for Christmas and everyone in the family loved them and wants a pair for themselves. Great sound and look great. They also come with the cord so you can use them with non-bluetooth devices.,0
4.0,Works as described,"July 25, 2017",Yes,The product is excellent and does everything I expected. I could not give 5 stars because the instruction manual is a joke. So tiny it is unreadable w/o a magnifying glass. If they at least included a website with the manual you could use that to learn about the product.,0

They fit both me and my little brother exrtremely well, isolate sound extremely good, and are probably the best value for anywhere near this price point. Will definitely be buying a pair for myself in the future. Only con would be that at max volume it’s almost deafening but no one really needs to be listening at those volumes anyway.",0
4.0,Really nice headphones!,"March 6, 2018",Yes,"I really like these headphones!  They’re comfortable and easy to pair. The only issue, is there’s a light on the side that flashes blue. When I watching movies at night, the flash is distracting. Other than that, perfect!!",0

4.0,"Good Price, Not Much Bass","March 19, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these headphones are just fine. Do I wish they had more bass? Yes. But for $40, these were an ideal replacement for my Beats Solo2 Wireless that my dog chewed on. Please note, however, that I am not an audiophile, but I do love all types of music. The Mpow 059 Bluetooth headphones were a good buy as a replacement, saving me a couple hundred bucks. I will say that if you want a lot of bass in your ears, you might want to find an alternative to these.",0

I have contacted Samsung but they said it was not a problem on their end and to contact the seller.,0
4.0,A good improvement,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"The newer version of these is greatly improved sound quality. The shape of the pads on the previous version were oval and these are round.

5.0,Highly recommend,"December 13, 2017",Yes,"SO GREAT, esp for the price point! Works as described, fits my ears really well, does connect to 2 devices. It took a bit longer than I expected for the 1st charge, but I’ve been using it off &amp; on for a few days &amp; still have battery. Love it.",0

3.0,you'll probably want to spend your money on a better product. Mine are gathering dust,"June 27, 2018",Yes,"These do work wirelessly as advertised. But the sound is not as clear as your earbuds.

5.0,Amazing,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"This is my second pair, there was nothing wrong with the first pair, I just wanted the pink ones so I gave my old ones away.

The sound quality is good with using wired mode. I haven’t try wireless mode yet. I will give update later after a longer usage. I had it for about two weeks at the time writing this review. My overall assessment is for the price you cannot go wrong even if it lasted for few months.",0
4.0,Poor sound quality,"August 25, 2017",Yes,"The headphones look good they are soft and comfortable  but the sound quality is poor. For me there is no way to keep them..But the company has a better pair headphones you can also change EQ if you need it, I took them https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y27HM9W?psc=1",0
5.0,So I purchased these headphones and OMG I am so happy I did,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"I recently got my tragus pierced and I am unable to use my ear buds.

I always wear hoodies while working out, and I keep my hood up.  I wear these over my hood and they still sound great.  Drowns out all background noise, so I can really focus on the workout.

4.0,Happy customer.,"October 23, 2017",Yes,"A few hiccups such as turning itself off immediately after turning it on and an odd sound issue once. Both corrected by reconnecting through bluetooth options on PC. Other than that, they're a decent affordable bluetooth headset. Happy customer.",0
5.0,Bluetooth head phones connected to Amazon Fire Stick.,"February 1, 2018",Yes,"I just received these headphones. So I haven't had to much time with them. I can say so far they are pretty good, the material seems sturdy and ready for a long life. The padding is high quality and the sound is very good. They do not feel like a cheap pair of headphones...I brought these headphones for one specific reason. That is for my wife to use when she is watching TV at night while I am trying to sleep..We are cable cutters so I stream everything off of the amazon fire stick. I did a lot of reviews and asked a lot of questions about volume control independent of the headphones. I was told by others you can control the volume of the TV independent of the headphones. But this is not the case..Basically once you connect the headphones to the fire stick you loose volume control of the TV, you can only control the volume of the headphones. So if you are like us and watch TV together before going to bed but one of you wants to stay up late while the other sleeps than you will have to turn on the headphones and put them on..If you are hard of hearing and want to use these while watching TV with the family...tough luck you will be the only one with sound..(keep in mind I am only talking about the amazon fire stick with bluetooth connection, no the other optional methods)..Connecting to the Amazon fire stick was very easy and straight forward..-You power on the headphones by holding the power button down for a few seconds and the headphones will tell you they are powered up.-Than navigate to your bluetooth devices on the amazon fire stick and search for ""other devices""..-Push and hold the power button the headphones for 3 seconds, your headphones will tell you they are in pairing mode.-You should see the headphones pop up on the fire stick, select what pops up..-and your done..The distances is pretty good. Our bed is about 15ft from the TV and they connect fine with no drop outs..A pleasant surprise is that you can control the video from the headphones. Not only can you adjust volume, but you can fast forward, rewind, play and pause the video! I wasn't expecting that...All in all I am happy with my purchase and would recommend. I will update this review if we have problems in the future.",2
5.0,Great product for the price,"February 27, 2018",Yes,Works really well for bluetooth headphones. Relatively comfortable. Decent sound. Nice and light. Pairing with multiple devices was mostly easy. You won't be able to find a better set of headphones for the price.,0
5.0,Better than other Bluetooth headsets I have bought.,"April 5, 2018",Yes,I've bought other wireless headsets before but I really love this one. Charges quickly. Fits well. The sound quality is what I expected for a $40 headset. This brand was recommended to me and I would recommend it to my friends.,0
5.0,Excellent product! Delivered as promised,"April 27, 2018",Yes,"Excellent product!  Delivered as promised.  Excellent sound quality in earphones, excellent sound quality from mic for callers.  No problem being understood or complaints of poor sound quality from callers.",0
3.0,"Static, Low Quality sound.","November 2, 2017",Yes,"Not quite right. I can’t get the sound to...well sound good. It’s such a nice pair but the static is a problem as well. I can’t listen to music, either because it sounds muffled or it sounds low quality, no matter how much toy with the mixer. It’s just not a fitting pair for me.",0
5.0,Quality headphones,"August 27, 2017",Yes,From my 10 year old son's point of view.  He uses it to listen to music when it's connected to the iPad or chomebook via bluetooth.  He likes the sound quality and comfort of the headphones (it's not heavy and doesn't squeeze your head or ears).  He like the carrying case which was included.  There was no charger included but the charging cable is included.  It also includes a 3.5mm cable but the microphone doesn't go thru this cable.  He likes the red color too.  It is a good value for the price.,0
5.0,Great quality!,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"Great product, looks real nice, works well, comfy on ears and nice sound. Thank you Amazon..https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07585JXNZ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47",0
3.0,Decent Headphones for the Price,"March 25, 2018",Yes,The only thing I do not like about these headphones is that all the buttons are on one side and to turn it on/off you have to hold the button for more than 5 seconds. These don't work well with glasses either.,0
5.0,Failed after less than a year - but still 5-star support,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"Revising... sent new pair in 3 days... stellar support.  Thank you...Not happy with these headphones... they were purchased as a gift for my daughter, and they have failed after 10 months.  I suppose there's no longer a warranty on them... that's too bad as I would have liked to give them a better rating.  Initial quality was good, but I don't want to have to buy a new set every year.  I think a 3-year lifespan at a minimum would be more acceptable.",0
5.0,Amazing headphones!,"December 17, 2017",Yes,"I did some research before I bought these, and I'm glad I did! They have excellent sound quality and bass. Usually over-the-ear headphones have less bass because they're away from the ear. These, however, fit around the ear so that it can be right against your head and you hear every little bit of your music. Play a song that's in FLAC and it sounds amazing. Wearing them for a long time can become uncomfortable, but you get used to it. These are a good buy and I recommend them.",0
5.0,Sounds great for the price,"February 20, 2018",Yes,"These sound pretty damn good, not a lot of base but filling. Only issue I have is how hot I get wearing these, as off I have a  pair of ear muffs they hold the heat to well. Other than that a great product",0
2.0,Ear cups too small!,"November 11, 2017",Yes,"Headphones seem to function OK, but ear cups are too small to fit comfortably around my ears. Do not recommend if you have medium to larger sized ears...Update: Patozon sent me an unrequested replacement pair of MPOW H2 headphones. Unfortunately I do not care for this model either since they are an on ear style that tends to crush the ears. I find they are very uncomfortable for long term wear and provide very little noise isolation.  I have reverted to using an older pair of Sennheiser around ear headphones that are not wireless, but are much more comfortable.",0
5.0,Good headphones for day-to-day use,"March 31, 2018",Yes,Not sure why different colours cost different but I got the pink one and my boyfriend has the red one. Both work great and fit great. There was one isolated incident of bluetooth connection problems but it only happened once. Audio quality is average. Good purchase if you just want a set of bluetooth headphones for day-to-day use. If you are looking for something more high quality I'd invest in a more expensive kind.,0
3.0,Not for conference calls,"August 1, 2018",Yes,"I ordered these to use for work on conference call and they were not great. Everyone sounded under water and I had a hard time hearing others. Unfortunately, I need to return these.",0
5.0,"Great product, would recommend","September 6, 2018",Yes,These work great! They look great. They are comfortable. Sound quality is good. Great price. And have held up over the last few months. Very pleased with this purchase.,0
5.0,... this for my son and he said it sounded great and the headphones were comfortable,"October 2, 2017",Yes,"I bought this for my son and he said it sounded great and the headphones were comfortable. These were to be used with his Xbox , but are not compatible(I wish I read further into the reviews) so he traded a pair with his sister and she really likes them 😊",0
1.0,Can't recommend these. Microphone sounds like crap and it seems ...,"August 17, 2017",Yes,Can't recommend these. Microphone sounds like crap and it seems to always go into pairing mode when I try to shut them off. Only positive is that they are comfortable.,2
5.0,Great for airplane trip!,"October 8, 2017",Yes,"I bought these to use on an airplane trip. I don't enjoy flying and wanted to be able to zone out with some soft music. These headphones were a perfect, comfy fit (I have a large head and big hair). They don't completely cancel noise, but I also used silicone ear plugs, and the loud engine noise was pretty muffled. Very happy with this purchase!",0
4.0,fantastic!!,"November 13, 2017",Yes,"For the price, fantastic!!!  Good quality , solid feel, tight fit (a little too tight, but not horrible)  Good sound quality and ""phone free"" control of music.  Could use better bass but that being said best ive had short of Bose.  Definitely worth it.",0
5.0,A great pair of headphones!,"March 31, 2018",Yes,"The Bluetooth connects easily, they include wires to make a wired connection, the battery charges quickly and lasts a long time, they are comfortable to wear, the sound is great, and the price is right.  What's not to like?",0
5.0,"Great headphones, great price","May 20, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are great.  We purchased one pair and they worked well, so we purchased a second.  They were easy to charge and connect.  I have connected them to our iPhones, iPads, and a Samsung tv.  So far no issues yet. They are comfortable on the ears and not too heavy.  The noise cancelling feature works well if you are listening to music or an audible book.",0
4.0,Everything's great so far except the signal range,"August 4, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are a great bang for your buck! The sound quality is amazing for the price, and they are easily charged through USB. The battery lasts a long time on a full charge, at least so far. The only disappointment I have at the moment is with the signal range; the description says it reaches up to 33 feet, but even a mere 15 feet away the sound cuts and the bluetooth disconnects. I'm usually not that far away from my device anyway, but it is the only thing I'm unsatisfied with as of yet. For the time being, if you're the type of person who doesn't distance themselves from their device, this is a good choice of wireless headphones!",0
4.0,Good for the Price,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"Cheap, sounds good, good connectivity, and relatively comfortable...Biggest problem is that it's still kind hurts after long periods of wearing it (over 3 hours) from pressing against my ears. I think it's starting to break in a bit.",0
5.0,Sound seems better through bluetooth than through aux cable but may be quality of aux cord that comes with headset,"March 18, 2018",Yes,"Tried these out immediately after I got them and they worked great. The sound quality was a little weird with a wired connection, but bluetooth sounds great. It may just be the quality of the cord that came with it, but I got these for the mobility of the bluetooth so these work perfectly for me. Paired very quickly with my phone and are very comfortable with nice, basic sound controls right on the headset. I also appreciate the fact that these ship with a travel bag which will definitely be used.",0
5.0,Great sound!,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"I liked that it was very easy to set up, good quality sound, and looks good..I'm not a fan of how heavy they are and they are very warm over the ears, but that aside, they are awesome!",1
5.0,Great for long international flights,"October 29, 2018",Yes,These were suggested to my daughter who was on a 18 hour journey to Uganda. She told me they worked perfectly to keep the Ambient noise of the airplane and passengers out.,0
5.0,I'm so glad I did,"April 18, 2018",Yes,I was looking for new headphones.  My old ones fell apart and was not bluetooth.  I searched through Amazon's selection and found these. I'm so glad I did!  I never had bluetooth earphones and they are awesome.  I really love being able to talk on them too!  And the sound from the speakers is very clear.,0
5.0,He says they are really comfortable and easy to use,"May 31, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my husband and he really likes them. He says they are really comfortable and easy to use. I would definitely recommend them these based on his experience and as a bonus the price is very reasonable.,0
5.0,"Great headphones, my 12 year old son loves them","August 23, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones, my 12 year old son loves them! We had initially considered Beats or Bose headphones for our son, but because his school requires headphones, I was worried what might happen to those expensive ones, so not wanting to compromise style or quality, I opted to purchase these much more reasonably priced ones, what a great decision that was! My son is even more thrilled than I am. Great sound, bluetooth and wire modes work fantastically, the headphones ""speak"" to him when disconnecting or else, they are very comfortable and super stylish. Just perfect!",0
2.0,Constant Low Static Noise,"February 18, 2018",Yes,"When they are turned on, there's an audible static ""fuzz"" noise. You can hear it below every quiet song, and it will remain for a second or two after you hit ""pause,"" so you really notice it. Very annoying. Going to have to return these.",1
5.0,These are the best pair of headphones I have owned,"February 12, 2018",Yes,"These are the best pair of headphones I have owned, hands down.  I bought them 6 months ago and I use them daily at the gym.  The battery life is excellent.  I can go about three weeks before I have to recharge them.  They stay positioned on my head great; I only rarely have to adjust them if I lay down quickly.",0
5.0,Why would they.....,"February 18, 2018",Yes,"Why anyone would pay three, or four hundred dollars for a pair of headphones is beyond me. These work perfect, connect immediately and sound pretty darn good. You definitely get more than you pay for here. Love them!",0
1.0,Bad experience,"October 26, 2017",Yes,"Long time to charge and short duration. When the power is less than 20 percent, an annoying sound beeps every ten seconds. That means you actually can't use it under 20 percent power. Insulation is bad, people beside you may hear the  music. Unstable music when walking on the street.",2
5.0,These are nice for many activities,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"These are nice for many activities, let my brother use them for a few minutes as he would not believe what I was telling him about the sound quality. He ordered one from Amazon as soon as he took my off.......Thank You,.Zuko",0
2.0,Not a long life span,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"I have had 2 sets of these.  Neither lasted a year.  I bought them for tractor and loud equipment work and they were great.  I would give 5 stars had they lasted.  Same issue with the jaws style by the same brand.  At least those go slowly, one ear bud at a time...",0
5.0,Well with a Hearing Aid!,"December 22, 2017",Yes,"I have a hearing aid (only in the left ear), and was looking for a good pair of headphones that would work well with having my hearing aid in while listening to music. It works perfectly and I can still wear my hearing aid without having my ear hurt, or having the sound be too different between my two levels of hearing. I do have to wear the left side a bit higher up for my hearing aid to catch the sound, but it is a small price to pay for having it work so well!",0
5.0,These are the best bang-for-your-buck headphones ever,"April 15, 2018",Yes,"These are the best bang-for-your-buck headphones ever. They fit comfortably over (not on) my ears, the Bluetooth works great-- I didn't even read any directions to get it to pair. The sound quality is a little tinny but for the price there is no room to complain. The microphone to be able to take calls is also an added bonus. These are amazing.",0
5.0,You can't beat these fore the price,"July 16, 2017",Yes,"35 bucks, wireless Bluetooth headphones. You can't beat these for the price. They sound very good. I wish they could be turned up a little louder, but honestly there is nothing to complain about. They seem to be well made. They aren't flimsy at all. They fit my big head.",0
5.0,Great noise canceling,"April 18, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my nephew who is 7. He needed a good pair of headphones to cancel out noise due to his sensitivity to sounds. He can get worked up my sensory overload. These worked great and are easy to store. He loves them and it's perfect for any noisy situation. It drowns it out so he can chill on his iPad or just have some quiet.,0
5.0,Very pleased. Great purchase!,"May 29, 2017",Yes,Very pleased. Excellent price. I'm an iPhone idiot and paired on first attempt by reading very thorough instructions. Sound quality GREAT!!!!! Using them as I'm a runner and did not want the pesky cord. Haven't tried the phone option yet but will update when I do. Highly recommend!,0
5.0,... these for my son last year and he has loved them. My daughter tried it out and begged ...,"January 18, 2018",Yes,"Bought a pair of these for my son last year and he has loved them. My daughter tried it out and begged for a pair of her own. Battery life has been good, sound quality is surprisingly good. I don't know how well the microphone picks up voice because we haven't tried it out.",0
5.0,Great buy,"April 20, 2017",Yes,Great set of wireless headphones. I have a small head and tiny ears and it's fits comfortably without being too tight or falling off my head. Sound quality is good and functions perfectly. As this is my first set of wireless headphones I have no basis of comparison but thus far I'm satisfied with the product,0
5.0,Untethered! Love it.,"June 21, 2017",Yes,"Sound quality and tone not unlike the Beats headphones; tends towards bass a bit. Charge seems to last quite a while and they are comfy to wear. The closed design blocks out external noise, so don't expect to hear anyone when they are on, which may be good/bad depending... ;)",0
5.0,Great value,"October 9, 2018",Yes,"These are a great find. The battery life is long enough for gym sessions without charging in between, the ear covers are comfortable and easy to clean and they are light weight and not bulky.",0
5.0,and i love them so much,"March 7, 2018",Yes,"I just got these headphones today, and i love them so much. I was looking for headphones that were cheap, sounded and looked good. This product did just that. The sound is very clear, and they cancel noise very well. One thing i was shocked about what how big they are. Like s***t, i have a big a** head, but these headphones make my head look like a tennis ball.",0
5.0,Great value and quality.,"October 19, 2017",Yes,For the money and the ability to use BT or a wire these headphones are excellent quality. Mpow has always made solid products in the past and had high expectations going in and very pleased. The nice compact folding is an added bonus.,0
4.0,Great Headphones!,"May 27, 2018",Yes,"Great headphones at a really affordable price. The sound is great and I love how it can be wired and at the same time wireless! I give it four out of five stars because I think they could better the confort in the ears. After a while in use they begin to hurt and you have to remove them to relieve the pain. Overall they are great for the price they are, would recommend to anyone!",0
5.0,Great value,"September 16, 2018",Yes,"Great value for what you get.  Really enjoy these.  No, they aren't noise-cancelling, but I also don't want to pay and arm-and-a-leg for a quality wireless headset.",0
5.0,Exceed my expectations,"September 12, 2017",Yes,"Wow.. nice.. exceed my expectation. Now I am contemplating if I should take this to business trip instead of 3 years old Bose noise canceling head phone.. no cable,, over the ear, more base.. not a noise cancelling, but as over the ear, block noise.",0
5.0,These are fantastic. Sound quality is great,"July 5, 2017",Yes,"These are fantastic. Sound quality is great, they charge fast, and the wireless works great. I've had these for 2-3 weeks and I wear them 7 hours a day at work. I can't think of a single complaint other than that they make my ears a tiny bit sweaty. But I live in Florida, so just existing makes me sweaty.",1
5.0,Love these,"December 2, 2018",Yes,Not had these long but they are very comfortable..As I am slightly deaf I can't really comment on the sound quality though its good for me.,0
5.0,"For what it’s worth, its a bargain","March 7, 2018",Yes,"Pros:.-Comfortable over the ears headset..-Comfortable even with glasses on..-Music sounds phenomenal for the price.-Awesome noise reduction( not like a bose noise cancelling headphones, but for the price it’s an awesome bonus feature)..Con:.- Can’t use mic on several games like Overwatch, Battlegrounds, etc. works with discord, skype, etc. Otherwise, it’d be a great gaming headphones.",0
5.0,Mpow good,"March 20, 2018",Yes,I did not care for these particular headphones. They were too big and bulky for me. I found another product from Mpow that works for me.  Company has very good communication and is willing to help to get the product right for you.  Can't go wrong with Mpow!,0
5.0,Pretty good!,"April 26, 2017",Yes,"Wanted a cheap headset to watch tv at night without disturbing the other half. Found these and looked okay. Impressed with the quality. These do not appear typical of cheapo Chinese goods. The assembly and finish is actually quite nice. They are comfortable to wear, at least for an hour or two. They seal up pretty well against my ears and the ear pads are very soft. If I continued use beyond two hours, I suspect my ears my become sore as other reviews have said...The sound quality is pretty good. They have some bass to them, more than enough for television. Didn't have much issue connecting to the Bluetooth transmitted which I also just bought. Took a couple minutes to get it worked out, and I had to go through the connection process again a few days later, but no biggie. The only thing I can complain about, and it's not really a fair complaint, is the squeaky smooth frame rubs against my pillow and echoes the sound through the headphones. So, I have to keep my head perfectly still if I don't want to hear the rubbing. Sorta sounds like when you rub your hand against a balloon...echoing in your ears. I recommend these to anyone who is drawn by the price and style. You'll be getting exactly what you think you are.",3
5.0,They keep a charge for a really long time !!,"September 15, 2017",Yes,Got these over six weeks ago and my son just charged them for the first time!!. You know there are others out there who claim to be the best but for the price  I could buy five of these for one of those. In my mind this one ranks up there pretty high .,0
5.0,Very happy with them,"June 12, 2017",Yes,"Excellent sound quality. Have used them paired to my iPhone 6s for privacy while working and to a bluetooth transmitter on my TV so I can crank up the volume without disturbing my wife. Not something I'd want to go jogging with but since I don't jog, that's not an issue.",0
5.0,Great gift for adolescent males,"November 26, 2017",Yes,My 9 yo grandson loved these that we gave him for his birthday.  He uses them mostly with his tablet for games and vids. His brother liked them too and wants a pair for himself. He is 11. See my review of these with the blue pair.,0
1.0,Broke in 3 months and now I can't even return them,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"Updated review. After 3 months the side button popped out during normal use. I can't seem to pop it back in, considering you use the one button for like 5 functions it seems like they should stand by the product.",0
5.0,"The headset is really good, fits my head perfectly and the sound is ...","February 9, 2018",Yes,"The headset is really good, fits my head perfectly and the sound is awesome.  I couldn't ask for a better product or a better price.  I have not yet been able to pair it with my computer but I'm still working on it.",0
5.0,Great Item,"May 7, 2017",Yes,"I wanted an inexpensive pair of bluetooth headphones to use at the gym, and this item is perfect. The directions were easy to follow and set-up was a breeze. I love the bag to keep them in and the cord to use when the battery runs low or when I want them wired. Great purchase.",0
4.0,Great for the price,"July 21, 2017",Yes,"I have multiple sets of headphones for various things. These are great for mowing since they are isolate the music from the noise of the mower. They're not very sweat-proif, but that's to be expected for this type of headphones...Overall I'm happy with the audio quality, bluerooth pairing and comfort level. I would recommend these to anyone in need of a good pair of headphones for this price range.",0
5.0,They looked nice and as expected,"July 16, 2017",Yes,"I ordered these headphones for my husband's birthday.  They arrived undamaged.  They looked nice and as expected; However, when we plugged them in, only the left headphone worked.  We thought it must have been the speaker settings.  We tried everything and finally accepted that the headphones were faulty. Made for a disappointing birthday. UPDATE:  We were sent a new pair of headphones completely  hassle-free and they are awesome!  Thank you so much!!!",0
5.0,These are pretty great Headphones for their price,"July 12, 2017",Yes,"These are pretty great Headphones for their price. Good points; The Bag it comes with along with their ability to be folded make for easy and safe transport. The sound is good and does a pretty good job at phasing out surrounding noise even when your roommate is blasting music at max volume next to you. The battery life if very good.. Complaints are minimal: For some reason when I Skype they don't work, but other calling services like LINE will (probably a Skype problem). After wearing them for more than 5 hours your earlobes get a bit sore... I was recommended these by a friend and will continue to recommend them to mine.",0
1.0,Total waste of my money. Stopped working after 3 uses,"November 28, 2018",Yes,These no longer charge. Ive used them 3 times. Of course it's outside of the return window so Im screwed. this was a huge waste of my money :(,0
3.0,I wasn't impressed by the sound quality. This may ...,"January 3, 2018",Yes,I wasn't impressed by the sound quality. This may have been partly due to the bluetooth drivers on my computer but I could not find a way to improve the sound nor could I find alternative drivers. I returned these shortly after getting them.,0
4.0,Headphone Review,"August 9, 2017",Yes,"Not a bad product for the price I paid for it. Decent sound, works at a pretty good distance from my computer or other blue tooth devices I use. Battery has a decent life. Have only had them for about a week, so I have no idea how well they will hold up to daily use.",0
5.0,I enjoy it for my workouts at the gym,"April 30, 2018",Yes,"I have used this for about a year now. I enjoy it for my workouts at the gym, for my commutes to school, and so on. The Bluetooth is quick, the changing volume and song/podcast function is nice. The cushion on both the ear and handle is amazing. It even folds which is a nice touch. Nothing wrong, and great quality. This thing is my baby.",0
5.0,Great Christmas present,"December 25, 2017",Yes,"My daughter loves the features of this headphone. Bluetooth, wireless, foldable, good sound, looks good at a very good price. Everything she wanted in a headphone without paying an outrageous price for a brand name.",0
5.0,Very good sound and comfort !,"December 6, 2017",Yes,"I must have over a dozen of current headphones, so I feel I can claim that I am an experienced user..It has great sound and comfort !!  Shipment arrived quickly and as promised..Been using it 3/4 hours a day, 5 days a week.  Not that I have to, but I charge every other day just to make sure (battery seems more that good)..Five Stars +++",0
4.0,Great product... crappy mic. Don't buy for gaming!!,"November 6, 2017",Yes,"What can I say about this headset. Being that I gave it 4 stars, I actually just had to send mine back. All I can really say is it's a damn good headset with amazing sound performance.... but don't get it for gaming because the mic absolutely sucks!",0
5.0,Great headphones. I am surprised at the quality for ...,"February 26, 2018",Yes,"Great headphones. I am surprised at the quality for the price, they are really really good. Good base, good separation of voice from background. So far, they are very comfortable on the ears, no pain. They cup the ear nicely, and I wear them for about 8 hours a day. If you are thinking of purchasing these, stop thinking and just do it. You won't be disappointed.",0
5.0,Perfect for Daughter,"August 12, 2017",Yes,"My daughter loved these -- the freedom to dance/sing around the room cord-free, plus the comfort and style. I loved that they were 20% of the cost of Bose &amp; Beats. Unfortunately they were stolen, but I am going to order a replacement set right now.",0
2.0,Charging light would not turn off,"March 26, 2018",Yes,"We purchased (2) of these headphones for our children. One works as expected so far, but the other had issues right from the start. We plugged it in to charge and when it's done charging the light is supposed to shut off (indicating the battery is fully charged). The light never went off, a few days later the headphones would not charge at all. We sent them back for a full refund and ordered a replacement pair. Seems like a good set of headphones assuming they work as they are supposed to.",0
5.0,No regrets,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"Excellent headphones, and not just for the price! I was apprehensive about buying these because other ""over the ear"" headphones I've tried fit ON the ear, which would hurt. But they actually go over the whole ear so it doesn't touch my ears! The material it's made of is comfortable and the sound quality is great. It also has a cord if you don't want to use it wirelessly. Great buy. When the time comes I will be getting these again.",0
5.0,great headphones,"May 26, 2017",Yes,"We like them a lot except unfortunately they aren't able to Bluetooth connect to the Samsung tablet that I was planning to use them with for my son. They will connect to my Samsung phone, but do not show up on the Bluetooth for the tablet for some reason. This means that we have to use them wired, but at least they came with a cord for that...The battery has also lasted surprisingly long.",0
5.0,"Good Product, Good Price","July 26, 2017",Yes,I really like these headphones.  They are well made and fit well against your ears when using them.  The sound quality is fair.  I was looking for inexpensive Bluetooth headphones and these have exceeded my expectations considering I paid less then $40.00 for them.,0
5.0,"Beautiful Design, Flawless operation","January 23, 2018",Yes,"In this day and time, it is refreshing to encounter a product that is not all cast plastic.  The construction of this headset is truly a work of art.. not obvious in the listing photos is the stainless steel inner headband, and the whole thing is put together with metal clasps and lovely machined screws (at least 12 visible)..So, it is really a sensual joy to pick this up and place it on your head.  The construction almost feels like a finely jeweled watch.. so surprising for a $30 product...The ear cups seem to be very solidly attached to the band (yet in a way that they articulate to conform to your head), and the ear pads just look like they are going to hold up for a decent time period (granted, I've only had this baby for about 2 weeks)..I've had bluetooth headsets in the past, and finally got away from them because it seems like you are always battling with getting the damned thing to pair up.  Not so with this unit.. When I first connected to my tablet, of course I had to go into my tablet bluetooth settings, but just one time...Ever since, even when the headset auto-powers-down from extended idle time, I just put them on, open my tablet, press the multifunction pairing/volume button on the headset, and, voila, beautiful sound...I use this headset almost exclusively with a single tablet.. I'm guessing pairing to multiple devices might add an additional degree of complexity to the process, but that's never an issue for me...My hearing isn't what it used to be, so I am used to cranking up the volume, but, man.. these babies are LOUD.. even my feeble ears can only tolerate about half volume...As far as sound quality, I won't say these produce true high fidelity sound, but that's not what I bought them for.. mostly watching movies and YouTube, where the sound quality and bass response is without criticism...A bonus is the plug-in cable that comes as an accessory, so I suppose if you had a non-bluetooth device just can just plug it right in and enjoy your sound...truly an astounding product for the price.  Why pay more?",2
4.0,No Longer Disappointed.,"March 7, 2017",Yes,I returned this head set as it wouldn't pair with my bluetooth transmitter while other bluetooth head sets I have pair without any problem at all. It just sat there flashing red/blue and never stopped after repeated attempts.  I tried pairing it with my Samsung phone with a similar result...UPDATE...The vendor sent me a new pair for free..  The new pair works fine..  Great customer service.,13
2.0,These are far too tight and painful to wear long term,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"These are far too tight and painful to wear long term. Battery life is great, and the corded option is very handy, but would give zero stars for comfort alone...Update: These headphones are still very uncomfortable, but the company has reached out send me the H1s, which I greatly appreciate and they're lighter, more flexible, and more comfortable!",0
2.0,"Poor sound quality, even a the lowest volume.","December 2, 2018",Yes,"Quick charge, comfortable to wear, easy to pair w/ bluetooth device, but the sound was poor.  There was a notable buzz/vibration on the bass end, even at the lowest volume.  Also, low volume was not really very low.  I will return this product.  Poor quality even for a moderately priced product.",0
5.0,These are some of the BEST sounding headphones I've ever owned,"November 23, 2017",Yes,"These are some of the BEST sounding headphones I've ever owned. I was sceptical about the quality this brand was going to deliver but I will say I'm pleasantly surprised. Worth the price all the way. I now use these for music editing when I used to use a more expensive brand because it was so called the ""industry standard"" when I use the them and then put this new pair on I can hear a great difference in sound quality I'm amazed. Great affordable product. WOW!",0
5.0,"Semi-Noise-cancelling, comfortable fit for long wear","January 17, 2018",Yes,"They are noise-cancelling but I am still aware of some noise around me, but it is not bothersome..They fit well over my ears, nice and snug and don't hurt over time..I do have small ears but I also have an industrial piercing (look it up) and it is not bothered by the over-the-ear-foam.",0
1.0,One Star,"July 22, 2017",Yes,Sound sucks bought better cheaper on this sucks !,2
4.0,These work well and I like them. They fit well as I use them ...,"February 6, 2018",Yes,These work well and I like them. They fit well as I use them in the gym while working out.  I would have given them 5 stars but the sound quality of these headphones is not a good as other headphones I have owned.,0
5.0,Great stereo sound,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"Love the stereo sound, comfortable over the ears, and love the green color to tell them apart from my husband's black set and my granddaughter's pink set. Also the compact foldability is perfect for airplane travel.",0
4.0,I had some very minor issues with them at first ...,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"I had some very minor issues with them at first regarding to cutting out sometimes, but the issue resolved itself over time..My only problem that still stands is that people can't hear me too well when I use the mic in bluetooth mode during a call.",0
2.0,The sound quality is bad. I do not recommend these headphones,"December 10, 2017",Yes,"These are very low quality headphones. They work, but the material it’s made of is very weak. The bluetooth feature glitches. The sound quality is bad. I do not recommend these headphones. I receommend saving up more money to buy bose headphones.",0
2.0,Seems to unconnect to my phone partway through songs,"December 24, 2017",Yes,These have good sound.... if they would stay connected to my Bluetooth device!! I will be sending them back for either new ones or a refund. It keeps stopping partway through several songs then it tells me after a minute or 2 of silence that Bluetooth 1 is connected although my Bluetooth device is rite beside me,0
4.0,Don't recommend this model but Patozon are fantastic!!,"August 22, 2018",Yes,"They are very comfortable and look impressive. Sound quality is very poor when using in Bluetooth mode. I wanted to use them for podcasts and music and both sound very thin and metallic...Update:..Patozon saw that I was dissatisfied with their headphones and sent me a replacement model for free (without any notice, what a surprise!!!!). Not only was I blown away by the service but the sound quality on this pair is excellent!",0
5.0,Best buy,"August 25, 2018",Yes,"I went through a couple of headphones off of Amazon, but this one is by the far the best. The sound quality is good, the headphones are super comfortable. I wear them at the gym and out on runs for several hours at a time. I really like the battery life. I’ve had these for about 3 weeks, and after the initial charge, the charge lasted for about a week and a half. I would definitely buy these again.",0
4.0,Great value for the price,"June 14, 2017",Yes,"I had it for about a week. Now I am using it everyday. It's a solid construction and quality. Great value for the price. I only wish the weight is a little lighter as right not I have to take it off after an hour or so wearing it, because it is kind of heavy. Otherwise 5 star!",0
5.0,Sound Great.,"December 26, 2017",Yes,I just received these yesterday so I can't speak for long-term quality. However I am very impressed with their sound and their Bluetooth performance. I find them to be comfortable on my extraordinarily average head.,0
5.0,Great!,"September 2, 2017",Yes,"These are awesome! I've used them at the gym and home, using my cell phone as a mp3 player. Have walked into another room and did not loose connection. Have used them to watch movies on my lap top. Plan on buying a second pair for my husband.",1
5.0,Great product for the price!,"April 21, 2017",Yes,"I was looking for 2 pairs of bluetooth headphones for my inlaws and settled on the Mpow headset. The price was just right and the reviews were great, especially sound quality. On trying the headset, they were blown away by the clarity of the music they were listening to as well as the noise cancelling ability. It looks really funny, but now they constantly wear it about the house listening to all their favorite music!.Thinking of buying a pair for myself!",0
3.0,Very solid classy head phones but....,"July 9, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are very well made, very comfortable, sound quality excellent. However there is one glaring problem. The control is on the right earphone. It is very difficult to see the indicators such as up down right left. If you hold it just right and the light hits it you can figure out what the indicators are. But that would mean taking the headphones off to do even the simplest thing such as changing the volume.  The little booklet that came with the headphones is tiny. The print is barely readable with a magnifying glass. I went online to their website to find an online version of the instructions. I couldn't find that. But the website shows a different headset with a much more intuitive set of controls on off, volume increase and decrease. When you are wearing the headphones, it is very difficult to increase or decrease volume, or do other functions. Because the wheel that does everything has no tactile points to tell where you are. You are left to struggle with the tiny book with the tiny font. Too bad. If it weren't for this I would love these headphones. I want the one on their website. Pictured is the headphone with the control",3
5.0,great for parents,"September 2, 2017",Yes,"Bought it for my 55 year old dad and he loves it. i have heard no complaints. I own a pair of beats so of curiosity i tried the mpows on and their quality does not compare. However, to somebody who had never really tried really good over ear headphones, these headphones are AMAZING apparently. its a steal",0
5.0,Better than I expected,"March 9, 2018",Yes,Great sound with decent bass at a great reasonable price. Got these as a lightning deal and was much better than expected. They're worth it at their original price I think. Comfy foam padding never had any ear pain with these. Battery seems to last forever.,0
5.0,"Sturdy, sound good","February 6, 2018",Yes,"Sturdy, sound good, and cost only a fraction of what I would have paid for the Beats version. Can connect simultaneously to my iPad and iPhone. Calls are clear with the built in microphone. Recommended.",0
5.0,Great Product!,"May 10, 2017",Yes,I was thinking that these might be too heavy for my son to use. They are actually pretty light. I was able to read the directions and show my son how to use them and he is 8yrs old. Very kid friendly.,1
5.0,The sound and connection is perfect. Why spend big buck on brand name,"February 5, 2018",Yes,Has not had any problem so far. The sound and connection is perfect. Why spend big buck on brand name?,1

5.0,Good headphones for the price,"August 5, 2018",Yes,"This is the second pair of headphones we have purchased. The first pair was for our older child and the little one wanted one too. Good product, easy to charge. Long battery life.  The kids are using them 24/7 :)",0
5.0,Exceptional quality for such a low price.,"October 20, 2018",Yes,"I've had these blue tooth/wired headphones for a while now; plenty time to put them through their paces, and I have to say they are very nice. Light weight, comfortable, good blue tooth range, great sound. Well done!",0
5.0,Very reasonable,"October 17, 2018",Yes,"After addressing an issue I had with my previous headphones, I was sent a new pair. The sellers are very reasonable and the headphones look awesome!",0
5.0,Great headphones for the price!!,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are awesome!  They connected immediately to my phone and I can use them as a headset too.  I was afraid people wouldn't be able to hear me since there is no mic in front of my face but no one has had a problem.  They are also very comfortable.  I wear them around the house while I'm cleaning and have had no problems with them sliding off.  My only problem is hearing someone (husband or son) come up behind me and hence, scare me!  Oh yeah...and they sound great too!  Well worth the money",0
4.0,Great for the $,"February 3, 2018",Yes,These were my first pair of over the ear headphones and they are very nice for the price. Decent sound and they are comfortable. Easy to pair to devices and lots of sound level settings. They look nice as a bonus.,0
4.0,cool,"February 11, 2018",Yes,"Purchased these as a christmas gift and my son enjoys them.  I don't know what to expect with the price range (a little piece came off and I put it back), but they are still working fine, so, so far so good",0
2.0,Does not work at n my apple products. Works ...,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"Does not work at n my apple products. Works with Echo dot. I want it to work, but even when I manage to pair them, there is no sound. I’ll post an update if I figure it out.",1
3.0,"feels comfortable, does ok blocking outer noise","June 16, 2018",Yes,"feels comfortable, does ok blocking outer noise, and volume level sucks, have to turn other device volume way up to hear well on headphones with headphones volume to the max",0
5.0,"For the price, this is the best","September 18, 2018",Yes,"I tried a few different headphones, and these have been my favorite for noise-cancelling, minimalist features, and sound quality. While these look a bit weird with a bulkier-than-normal design, they block out other sound really well and fold up to a fairly small size. The battery life has been great - I've used them for 6 hours and still haven't recharged.",0
5.0,Great value.,"June 27, 2017",Yes,"I took a flyer on these, having no knowledge of the brand, quality, etc. And I was extremely pleasantly surprised. The quality of construction, the sound quality, comfort and bluetooth functionality are all quite impressive - especially for the cost. Great value.",1
5.0,"If looking for Bose/Beats, save your money, buy these instead","November 27, 2017",Yes,"I was looking to buy an expensive set of wireless headphones.  I decided to take a look at these and try these first as they were a far cheaper option with all of the features I wanted.  I was pleasantly surprised when I first tried them on and started listening to music.  Great sound quality, very comfortable, good bluetooth connection with really great range.  If you are looking for Bose or Beats, save your money.  Buy these headphones instead.  They are fantastic for a fraction of the price.",0
5.0,Very happy,"January 7, 2018",Yes,I bought these Bluetooth headphones for my husband for Christmas and he like them a lot. In fact he uses them everyday. I checked on reviews for a few pairs and these had the best reviews. Glad I checked. We are very happy,0
5.0,I Definitely Will Recommend This,"January 1, 2018",Yes,I didn't have a chance to try them on before I bought them online and was shocked on how comfortable they are. The last brand of headphones I bought at the same price left ear aches and broke easily. Definitely would recommend this!,0
5.0,Tuned in to tune out the rest of the house:),"February 28, 2018",Yes,Have used for about 2 weeks and have watched several movies and TV shows on same charge and still going.

5.0,Ended up buying 4 sets!,"February 21, 2018",Yes,"Bought these for myself, loved them. My son tried them, he loved them (had to buy him a set). My daughter tried them, loved them (yep bought another set). Then youngest daughter tried them and yep you guessed it. Bought another set! Easy to connect, Great clear sound, comfy on head.

5.0,Great set of headphones for the price,"January 15, 2018",Yes,Great set of headphones for the price! I love that it has both options of wireless and wired depending on where and when I'm using it. Still haven't tested calls on it but I bought them for music so call quality isn't a big deal to me.,0
5.0,Perfect for my teenagers needs,"September 22, 2018",Yes,"My teenagers needed a headset to plug into a laptop for school, that could also double for his online games, this was perfect!  They are comfortable, last forever, and are very clear.  My kids love how they look too.",0
5.0,Nice for the Price,"May 2, 2018",Yes,Although not electronically isolating these headphones mechanically block a lot of external noise by the soft sealing pads on the ear cups.  I use these at the gym as well as on my PC at home.,0
4.0,A Dent in Time,"January 20, 2018",Yes,These came in on time.  I was saddened to find a dent in it.  Oh well.  Otherwise it's good.,1

1.0,My head hurts a lot when I put these headphones ...,"August 1, 2017",Yes,My head hurts a lot when I put these headphones on. They are extremely heavy and press down on the top of your head. I will be returning these and buying lightweight headphones.,3
5.0,Works Great!!!,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have been great, I use them mainly for watching TV at night when everyone else in the house is sleeping, they allow me to hear the TV without trying to turn it down very low so I won't disturb others in the house.  They work great, easy to set up.  I had to purchase the Mpow Bluetooth Transmitter, Portable Wireless Bluetooth Audio Adapter for TV, Paired with Bluetooth Headphones / Bluetooth Receivers to Listen the Sou in order to connect to the television.",0
5.0,Great value for the money.,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"Perfect fit, easy to pair with my I phone, extremely comfortable. I have only used one time, I bought these to wear while cutting grass. Love them so far. Carols husband.",1
5.0,It does a good job of blocking out the movies so it doesn't ...,"February 4, 2018",Yes,"Surprised how long the battery holds a charge. I mostly use these to watch movies on the Ipad at night while my wife sleeps. It does a good job of blocking out the movies so it doesn't bug her, and also does a good job cancelling out any ambient noise.",0
5.0,Seem pretty decent,"December 11, 2017",Yes,These seem like they’re built pretty good. I can justify buying a $250 beats for what I use them for but these work great. Battery is decent on loudest setting but not really that much bass. For the price though you can’t beat em.,0
5.0,Bought it for my son; He was impressed with ...,"July 22, 2017",Yes,"Bought it for my son; He was impressed with the sound quality. Hopefully, this product will withstand the toll exacted by tween boys.",2
2.0,What is sound???,"June 20, 2018",Yes,"They are nice headphones for sure. They looked just the picture and they were comfortable to wear however, I had mine for just about 4 months before they started to cut out sound. First it would alter the sound of things and wouldn’t play certain sounds and then they just stopped producing sound all together. I was super disappointed because they were actually nice and I enjoyed them but, they did not last at all.",0
2.0,These headphones worked great at first and has a number of good features,"February 26, 2018",Yes,"These headphones worked great at first and has a number of good features. Unfortunately the left ear of this headphone has begun to produce a very painful sharp bass note. This did not happen at first and does not happen all the time, however when it does it is very painful. Would love to recommend yet cannot due to this issue.",1
5.0,Great bang for your buck here!!!!,"July 11, 2017",Yes,"These things are basically noise cancelling, they are super comfy and sound better than I was expecting. Can't ask for better without spending $200 for Beatz",1
5.0,Very good headphones,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are great. They are very comfortable, sound great and I think they lack in the bass dept. but maybe that’s why they’re cheap. But they still sound really good. They have bass just not heavy bass",0
4.0,Great headphone,"October 2, 2017",Yes,"The quality is great. The ear pads cover completely. The reason I gave it 4 stars, is because it is very tight. There is no way to adjust how tightly the ear pad press on the head. I have a wide face so this may not be a problem to others.",0
5.0,Great product!,"September 8, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for my teenage son who originally wanted ""Beats"" but didn't want to spend that much money on them. After reading the reviews on the Mpow, I suggested he try these instead. He was more than pleased! He said they have great sound and bass. He is very satisfied and feels his money was well spent.",0
1.0,CUSTOMER SERVICE NOT GOOD DON'T BUY,"March 31, 2018",Yes,I must have gotten a bad unit it only holds a charge for only about two hours have had the unit for 3weeks but my son thru the package it came in away in the trash so I'm stuck with I used this unit a lot me being handicapped so I don't have a lot to do l g get tired of tv good luck hope this helps.customer service lied said they were going to send me and paid that never happened don't buy,0
5.0,Perfect sound quality,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"Perfect sound quality. The ear cushion simulate human skin texture and provides me with great comfort. This Bluetooth headphones provide a quick and very stable connection with my Bluetooth enabled devices like cell phones, tablets, PC and TVs .

4.0,"Solid headphones, lacks good bass, a little wide","May 22, 2018",Yes,"These are good headphones for the price. They're well made, have GREAT connectivity, are very comfortable (and encompass the ear), and have decent sound. My drawbacks with them were that the bass was sort of disappointingly weak and they were particularly wide which made them look a little ridiculous on my narrower head.",0
4.0,Sound quality could be better. They arrived quickly,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality could be better. They arrived quickly, work well, fit well and we get a greater working range than ones we paid 3 times as much.",0
5.0,Best headphones for the price!,"February 5, 2018",Yes,"I was going to buy Beats until I saw these as recommended. And I’m really glad I didn’t waste my money..These headphones are probably the best I’ve ever owned. It’s been about a week and I have not had to charge them at all even after continuous use. They are very comfy and look pretty nice...The only downside I can think of is that you really can not hear much outside noise when they are on, but that was the point of me buying them anyway. Try these. You will definitely get your money’s worth.",0
5.0,Great headphones. Little large for what I orbinslky bought ...,"January 28, 2018",Yes,Great headphones.  Little large for what I orbinslky bought them for but great for my kids. Bought another pair for my daughter. Cordless and foldable and heavy duty. Fits great on both my 2 year old and 5 year old.,0
1.0,Don't use this as a microphone for PC,"September 12, 2018",Yes,"This mic does not cooperate with Windows. It works okay for the most part but certain functions really screw with the os. For instance, it treats being in a chat channel in discord as a phone call and mutes everything else, with no way to change this 'feature.' Additionally if you are watching youtube or any video player it seems, and then enter a discord channel, it will pause the video.",0
1.0,Mic doesn't work.,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones, however the mic doesn't work well.  People can't seem to hear me, I have to repeat my self over and over again or shout.",3
5.0,Highly Recommend!,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"I got these with the intention of just using them for working out, but I use them all the time.

4.0,Headphones are light and comfortable. Audio is okay,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"Headphones are light and comfortable.  Audio is okay, could be more impressive on the bass side.  A good value for the money.",1
4.0,Ignore the price,"August 18, 2018",Yes,"If you aren't looking for really strong bass, don't spend any more than you have to. This is my second pair of Mpow headphones (dog destroyed pair #1) and I still don't understand how they're this inexpensive.",0
4.0,Too early to tell if it is as good as they say,"November 30, 2017",Yes,"Arrived several days earlier than quoted. Too early to tell if it is as good as they say. Headset fits very tightly, but is still comfortable. I bought as a wireless connection to my TV. Still need to connect to see how sound is from TV. Sound quality from iPhone is not great, but not bad. I shouldn't expect much at this price.",0
5.0,These are good quality so far,"March 3, 2018",Yes,These are good quality so far.  I had to go out of town for work and i really needed some headphones my others ones broke and they at great for the price and the sound quality is great.  I would purchase another pair.,0
5.0,Good Bluetooth headphones for the price,"March 24, 2018",Yes,For about $40 I can’t really complain. Just got them today but so far I’m loving them. I love the pink color.  the sound quality is decent but I wish it had more bass (not a huge deal honestly)  and that the volume could go a tad higher. The range is pretty good but I’d have my phone on me most times anyway. Also like that they fold and come with a bag to store them in. Overall a good purchase. Would definitely recommend. I’ll update to advise on charging time time and battery life.,0
5.0,Great headphones for everyday use!,"May 20, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are amazing!!! I take them everywhere with me; the battery life is very long and the quality of the sound, especially for the price, is great! Of course, these aren't noise-cancelling headphones, but they do a decent job of cushioning your ears to form somewhat of a sound barrier. Moreover, I can wear them for long periods of time without having them irritate my ears, which is a problem I used to have with other over-the-ear headphones. I highly recommend these!!",0
5.0,"Great sound, great deal!","May 4, 2018",Yes,"These Bluetooth headphones are great! Awesome sound. I really like all of the controls on the ear piece; volume, pause/play, skip. They are very comfortable to wear and have a great range. Definitely would recommend, especially at this price point. 👍🏻👍🏻",0
5.0,"Great sound, nice features","July 26, 2018",Yes,Bought these for my teen son. Previous reviews convinced me. He's very happy so far.  He's especially happy because he can't hear me when I'm trying to get his attention! Unless he's pretending.......,0
4.0,voice cues for pairing beats the blinking light indicator standard of the industry,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"This product works as described.  I am not a person who listens to music for hours, and still the option to hear a song from my phone or watch a TV show without broadcasting to the whole house is a big deal.  Great function.",0
5.0,Works well!,"August 4, 2018",Yes,"Arrived on time, soft headphones (around the ears and the piece that sits ontop of my head).  I only have 2 complaints.  First, the charging chord is too short, there is no possible way to wear and charge at the same time.  Second is just that my ears get sweaty - but I think that problem will go away once the summer heat leaves...Great sound quality and even without music playing it does a decent job of blocking out noise.",0
5.0,"Comfortable, Long lasting Battery, Long Range Bluetooth, Unbeatable price.","February 9, 2018",Yes,"I use these for several hours daily, sometimes more than 8 hours. They're comfy, well worth the minimal fee of $40. The sound works well for me, but I'm only using them for podcasts, books audible and webinars. The battery life and bluetooth range and excellent. I can listen to my laptop 2 stories away and throughout the entire house.",0
5.0,"Pretty great, last long","November 8, 2017",Yes,"Pretty great, last long, and has a nice range.  The sound quality isn't the HIGHEST caliber but in all honesty, as a person who casually listens to music for hours on end on a daily basis, it does the job swimmingly.  They have better sound quality than my yurbuds.  Earring wearers be worn though, as most over the ear headphones tend to do, they will press your earrings to your skin and thus may make you a bit uncomfortable after a while's use.  Though perhaps really small earrings may avoid the problem or be able to be tucked in, you can also simply take off the earrings as well.",0
5.0,A good buy,"October 6, 2018",Yes,"Extremely comfortable and quiet.  Customer service is outstanding, I had an issue with first pair and they replaced with no issues.",0
5.0,Update: This company read the review above and sent me a new pair of headphones.  I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK!,"August 30, 2017",Yes,"I love using these headphones and they worked great for 2 days.  On the 3rd day the small black plastic disk that is the on/off, connect/disconnect button fell off!  I managed to put it back on and had to scotch tape it into place.  It works again but having to tape it back together on the 3rd day takes some of the pleasure away.",0
5.0,"These are great, I couldn't get them to work with my ...","December 3, 2017",Yes,"These are great, I couldn't get them to work with my HP Pavilion g series laptop. I use these allot when I want some peace and quiet when I'm studying with no music, or I've fallen asleep wearing these. I bought these in Nov 2017, with no issues or problems to date.",0
5.0,Absolutely love these!,"October 30, 2018",Yes,These are amazing! I use them for listening to music as well as for work calls while working. Love the fact that you can use either Bluetooth or aux cable to listen.,0
5.0,Commy and works well,"January 27, 2018",Yes,These are comfortable and work great. The battery lasts a long time and the range is better than my bluetooth ear buds. Ambient noise is significantly reduced by the padding. The audio quality is good but of course not as good as my corded Bose headphones. There is no perceivable delay in the bluetooth when watching TV.,0
5.0,BEST. HEADPHONES,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"BEST. HEADPHONES!.These are seriously the best pair of headphones I've ever purchased. Better than my Beats! Comfortable, easy to use, great sound quality. And all for $40?! I bought a 2nd pair for my wife and had to share this with a couple of the guys I work out with and some friends. I bought these based on some reviews from reputable sources calling them the best headphones on the market. I couldn't be more thankful for finding these and buying them! Great price for high quality wireless headphones!",0
5.0,I love these headsets,"January 23, 2018",Yes,"I love these headsets.  They work great, very comfortable and nice looking.  One charge lasts several hours, I have used them for about 4 consecutive hours binge watching movies and battery power is still great.  Definitely recommend this item.",0
5.0,Mpow 059 Bluetooth Headphones,"December 9, 2017",Yes,These are well made and very stylish. Connected easy. Great sound good bass. They even talk to you,1
5.0,One Star,"May 1, 2018",Yes,Doesn't work. Charges but won't turn on. Followed instructions in booklet that came with it. I'm thoroughly irritated...Update: they sent me out another one that works. All is well. Wish they had more bass but eh.,0
5.0,"Great sound, though a bit bulky","April 28, 2018",Yes,"Pros: great sound. So far no issues with connectivity. Amazing quality for the price..Cons: a bit bulky, definitely not for use at the gym! Looks like my head doubled in width",0
5.0,She says they are comfortable for long periods over her ears,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"Purchased as a 2017 Christmas gift for my teen daughter, she loves them, can't get her attention half the time now. She thinks the charge intervals are longer than whats stated. She says they are comfortable for long periods over her ears.",0
5.0,Very Happy With This!,"December 11, 2017",Yes,"Love it.  Exactly as described and just what I wanted.  I had to read the instructions, but once I got it going, I was cooking with gas.  No static.  No distortion.  Just niceness.  Very happy with this purchase.",0
5.0,Bought for my daughter and she loves it!,"September 1, 2017",Yes,I bought this Mpow for my daughter. This was her first blue-tooth headset and she loved it from right out of the box. It paired easily with the blue-tooth transmitter for watching TV and then she read the instructions and paired it w/ her cellphone.,0
3.0,"Cheap, but what do you expect?","November 26, 2018",Yes,"I just opened this package today and wore them for about a half hour. Right off the bat, I noticed the sound quality is lacking.. it's tinny and has a slight crackle... Reminds me of the throw-away earbuds that came with my Zune back in 2006. Also, the headphones look a bit goofy if you have a big head (like me). With that said, you get what you pay for... A cheap pair of wireless headphones.",0
5.0,... so I went on and got me a set Best Buy of the year for sure have had them ...,"December 6, 2017",Yes,Wish I would of known about these sooner.I sweat a lot at the gym and my beats headphones would always mess up..A co worker told me about them so I went on and got me a set..Best Buy of the year for sure.have had them for about 4 months and still working like brand new.Pros:.Long lasting battery.Sweat proof.Loud..Cons:.None at all..Highly recommend,0
5.0,Great Headphones,"February 11, 2018",Yes,"I use this headphones daily. They are very versatile. I use them at the gym and while at the office. Before buying I did not understand well the Aux cable part of it, but you just hook on to a computer and listen (the headphones do not need to be on for this and therefore no need for it to be connected to bluetooth). The battery lasts for a long time. I charge once a week and I probably use them 2-3 hours a day (on Bluethooth). Definitely recommend this product.",0
5.0,Comfortable to wear,"November 16, 2017",Yes,I purchased a set for both my wife and myself to use on a recent overseas flight. The functionality of the head set is flawless. Easily set up with Bluetooth to multiple devices even though you can only use one at a time. I enjoy listening to music from my iPhone and watching movies from my tablet. The comfort and noise canceling of the headset is superior. Highly recommend the Mopow sets.,0
4.0,"Excellent value, but one size doesn't always fit all.","June 14, 2017",Yes,"Great! Fast shipping, works as advertised. Easy to set up, and the sound quality is quite nice! The ONLY con is that the earfoam is a tad small...So, if you don't have a small head/ears, it gets a tad uncomfortable. Add in the fact that I wear glasses, and it causes some serious discomfort if I wear them for a long time (which I do for work)...Regardless, great buy for the price. Very pleased!",0
5.0,Great head phones for the price!!,"October 3, 2018",Yes,Bought these head phones for long plane ride to Hawaii the sound is great and I charged and they lasted my entire 12 hour flight!  Can beat for the price!!,0
2.0,The constant blinking blue light bugs me.,"June 20, 2018",Yes,"After a few months of use, I've decided these headphones are best used when connected, with the cord, directly to a device. That's not a bad thing, except for the fact that this is a Bluetooth headset. Whenever it is paired there is a light that blinks constantly, and it appears there is no way to turn it off. If this doesn't seem like it would bother you, there are no other issues I have had. For me, however, it is enough to consider it a waste of money. Be forewarned.",0
4.0,Good product,"March 21, 2018",Yes,Been using this product for a few weeks now and it works great.  Nice sound and comfort.  Easy to pair with my phone.  Voice calls works well.  Doesn't block out outside noise that good.  So far the battery has been good and has not died during use.,0
5.0,Comfortable and Great Sound,"November 30, 2017",Yes,Sound as good as my more expensive earphones.  Well balanced sound with little listener fatigue.  Great fit around the ears and very comfortable..Pairs quickly with my phone.  Good reduction of ambient noise.,0
5.0,This makes me look funny. I have to wear a cap with it,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"This makes me look funny. I have to wear a cap with it. Lol..But that's all complain. It connects within 2 seconds, sound quality is good, easy to carry and blocks noise well.",0
2.0,Stopping working,"December 18, 2017",Yes,Only had this head phone for 3 month.  Only use it at my desk at work... Somehow for unknown reasons... Only one side of the audio works now...I expect higher quality and the headphones to last me at least 1 year!,0
1.0,terrible sound quality for music,"June 17, 2017",Yes,terrible sound quality for music ...really poor ...I wished I had sent these back ...and the connection is spotty ...,2
5.0,What a GREAT product!!!,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"Wow! Same functions as those $300 Brands for less. Actually, these have the Voice Feature which tells you when it's On and Off and when you need to Pair. Easy to recharge and charging last long. Worth it 100%",1
5.0,Work great with the second pair! Will buy again!,"February 23, 2018",Yes,Worked well at first and then over time the battery seems to decrease. Heard stuttering so I put the cable in. After 1/2 an hour the cable started acting up and the tv show started sounding muffled..Update** received a new pair and I have no issues with these! My kid’s are still working great! Changed my review to 5,0
5.0,Great sound,"October 3, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable to wear, easy to use.  It could use a bit longer range.  I have a split-level house and have difficulty picking it up in all spaces of the house.  I would say it picks up well within 25 feet.",0
5.0,Can see why these are best sellers.,"September 27, 2018",Yes,I use this with another bluetooth TV adapter I bought on amazon and have had no problems at all! Just charge them up sync and your on your way. Works with everything!,0
5.0,Great Buy,"April 5, 2018",Yes,My daughter loves these. She is not very careful with her stuff so for the price this is perfect. It does take a beating. Doesn't need to be charged to often and she uses it everyday. Great Buy,0
5.0,Really great customer service,"November 21, 2017",Yes,UPDATE:  Really great customer service! they send a replacement which is really great and gentle on the ears. I can wear it half a day  and it does not bug me..for some reason makes my ears sore after a bit :(,0
5.0,Great Buy!,"January 1, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my husband after purchasing a pair in another color for myself. He loves them just as much (?more"") than I do. The voice quality is amazing, Makes it so easy to talk and do chores and other necessities.",0
2.0,Customer service doesn’t exist!!,"May 3, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphones mainly to listen to my tv while on the treadmill, unfortunately i’m having trouble connecting to my tv. I purchased an Bluetooth transmitter but just having a lot of trouble, so with that being said customer support is non existent. Their web page is absolutely useless!!  I have emailed them over a week ago and still haven’t heard back. There is no customer service phone line.  Otherwise the headphones are good for the price. Just super disappointed in regards to customer service!",0
3.0,The headphone looks really nice and similar to more expensive products,"August 7, 2017",Yes,"The headphone looks really nice and similar to more expensive products. The voice quality is good but even with really low volume it will be disturbing other people as it can be heard from distance. Definitely not a good feature as this is the primary purpose of headphones..Also, it definitely has no noise cancelling effects.",0
5.0,Great Value,"July 27, 2018",Yes,"Excellent sound, very good bass. Very comfortable, lightweight &amp; quality construction..all for under $50 bucks!. These are not active noise cancelling, so be aware if that is what you are looking for",0
5.0,Excellent headphones for the money,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"I couldn’t believe the sound quality and easy set up for this price, I highly recommend this product.  Even though they say is not noise canceling, it blocked out almost all of the noise from my very loud tractor,  and was very comfortable to wear.",0
5.0,Attention Getting Headphones with Great Sound,"April 16, 2018",Yes,"These have good range, sound really good and look good as well.  I'm constantly being asked about them.  They are not too heavy and I like that they fold and come with a carrying case.",0
5.0,Great battery life,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"This is such a great product. It’s without words. The battery life is amazing, I have had it for a week now and outside of the first initial charge I haven’t needed to charge it yet. It blocked out any outside noises (ie my kids 😂) the sound for the music is amazing! But using it to talk on the phone the volume sucks, but since I bought it for music, not really upset about the sound quality for the phone calls. For me definitely worth the money.",0
5.0,Great sound,"March 15, 2018",Yes,"Works great!  I think my head may be too big as they sometime give me a headache if I wear them all day!  Sound is excellent and they do cancel out noise around me, which makes me talk too loud.",0
5.0,I love Mpow products,"September 27, 2018",Yes,I love Mpow products. These are easy to use and pair with your phone. That I can tell they don't work on a laptop or other devices that have bluetooth. But still great wear and comfortable. Haven't used them enough for any wear/tear to appear but have owned them for a little while. Still look brand new.,0
5.0,Very happy with these headphones,"March 17, 2018",Yes,"Very happy with these headphones! I use them wired mode with my digital piano and BT with my PC. Today was the first time I had to charge them since the day I got them. I used them daily with an average use of 2-3 hours for over a month plus one week. They are a tad heavy (compared to the  Logitech H600 headphones I had been using, they weigh a ton) and for the first week or so, they felt a little too snug. They are pretty comfortable now.",0
5.0,Cost effective yet good quality headset,"April 14, 2018",Yes,It's an outstanding headset with Bluetooth and wired options. Ear cushions are very comfortable. Quality of sound is good. Mic works well and it is quite light in weight. All in all a great product. Five stars!  Highly recommend it.,0
5.0,Great value,"November 1, 2017",Yes,Great value for the money! Very easy to set up and sound is wonderful. I bought it for my 75 years old dad for watching TV. After first use he said he haven't heard so good in 30 years :-),2
5.0,Mpow 059 Bluetooth Headphones,"November 17, 2018",Yes,Good quality for the price of the headphones. I have used this several times. Easy to use and hook up with a device. I recommend this.,0
5.0,Incredible sound!!!,"May 28, 2018",Yes,"My son loves them! Easy for a 5 year old to use because the headphones tell you weather they're connected, turned on or off and volume right on the side!! And the sound is incredible!!",0
1.0,I wish I could return these and would have just spent the money on a better pair.,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"I've had these for a month or so and they stopped working. They no longer play any sound through them even though I can hear that they are connected. I started using them with the cord plugged into my computer, and that just stopped working too. At first I had to jiggle the cord to get it to play right, and when I'd turn my head it would stop working, then last night I could literally hear the sound fade away as I tried to watch a lecture for school. I wish I could return these and would have just spent the money on a better pair.",0
4.0,So far working great. Easy access to volume and switching songs,"February 25, 2018",Yes,So far working great. Easy access to volume and switching songs. Connects easily to phone. Tried to make a phone call using aux cable that came with it and it’s a little hard for ppl to hear me even though I hear them great.,0
5.0,Winner,"October 17, 2017",Yes,What's really cool is there comfortable. The head band and the ear piece is nice and snug on my head especially when moving. I also like the vocals aka on and off wording. It's a winner and I am happy to have a pair. Thank you.,0
5.0,"Great Sound Quality, Rugged and Well Designed","February 28, 2018",Yes,"I've used these daily for the best part of a year now. They turn on and off easily, they pair effortlessly with my iPhone, and the sound quality is great. They're durable and rugged, and the hinges (which makes storage compact) show no signs of wear yet. I recently bought a second pair as a gift for a friend.",0
5.0,The sound is of great quality!,"December 3, 2018",Yes,The Unit fits very snug against your ears.  Very very easy to setup with your bluetooth.  Sound is of great quality.  Its much more inexpensive than the 100 dollar units and is worth every cent.  I would highly recommend it.,0
4.0,Great deal overall,"July 21, 2017",Yes,"It syncs with my iPod, computer and cell phone. I had to buy some extra things to make it work with my TV which is not Bluetooth enabled.. it's on the way and hopefully when it arrives I can pair it with my TV too :) It does hurt my ears a bit if I wear them too long, but other than that no real complaints.",0
4.0,Good value.,"November 26, 2017",Yes,"I've had a bunch of other brands that failed in some manner quite quickly. So far, this one has held up nicely.  I'd like the ""over ear"" design to be a bit larger for more comfort, but that is my only nitpick.",0
5.0,Good value for the money but sound quality is wanting..,"September 1, 2018",Yes,"These headphones perform exactly as they were described, my only critique is that the sound quality, especially in higher volume,is not as great as it was described. It does not have very deep bass at all but the sound is still ok. The headphones fit very well, the ear pads are very comfortable and they are large enough to cover the ears without touching them. All in all, for the price it's a good buy.",0
5.0,Fantastic headphones,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"I got these after I saw a well known person recommend them. They are excellent, especially for this price. Great quality and sound.",0
5.0,Great but!,"March 9, 2018",Yes,"I got the red/black pair 2 days ago and the battery is still on it's first charge! The sound quality is pretty good for what I listen to and pretty bad if it's on max volume, but there's no need to have it super loud. Some background noise is heard but isn't overwhelming. Definitely not for working out. I got one day shipping, ordered at 11 pm at night and got them the next day before 7 pm for just over $50. Overall, I love these headphones and definitely would recommend them to everyone!",0
5.0,"Snug, versatile, affordable","September 5, 2017",Yes,"A winner.  Wired or wireless.  Comfortable, great sound.  I'm not an audiophile, but as I get older I need clear crisp sound and a fit that is snug but not tight.  This meets those 2 requirements handily.  At the price?  A 5 star winner.",0
4.0,"Comfortable fit, I like these","March 29, 2018",Yes,"I am impressed! They charged quickly, and I have flown 4 cross country flights and no indication they need to be recharged yet, I'll update as I continue to use them. Comfortable fit, I like these.",0
4.0,I'm very happy with these,"December 2, 2017",Yes,"Pairing with my laptop wasn't intuitive nor was it explained in the instructions, but overall, I'm very happy with these. Once I was able to pair them to my laptop, I found that the sound quality was quite good and that I can walk to the other end of my house without them disconnecting. Pairing to my phone and tablet was easy. I haven't experienced any delay while watching videos. Very pleased and I'd recommend them.",0
1.0,Not What I Expected,"October 19, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphones because the high number of good reviews.  I was excited about getting a good set of headphones for a reasonable price.  I'm not sure if mine were defective but since day one the sound quality was very bad, hardly any bass.  I still decided to keep them because they were inexpensive, however a couple of weeks into using them the speakers were blown.  I then decided to return them.",0
5.0,"Good fit, great sound and a few features that ...","June 8, 2017",Yes,"Had to replace an old pair of RF wireless headphones that were starting to fall apart. Saw the MPOW bluetooth set on Amazon and figured for $36 and change I'd take a chance. Good fit, great sound and a few features that my $150+ old set didn't have. Only had them for a week but would buy them again...",0
1.0,You get what you pay for,"October 25, 2018",Yes,I knew I shouldn’t have spend the money on these. These did not filter out ANY outside noise - I could hear everything going on around me and the sound quality is pretty bad.  There is hardly any low end and the upper end just sounds distorted. Also tried to answer a call from my phone with them but the person on the other line could barely hear me. Pay the extra money for a better set of headphones.,0
5.0,Comfortable and sound pretty good,"March 22, 2018",Yes,Comfortable and sound pretty good.  I bought these with the mpow Bluetooth transmitter for my tv and Playstation and work great.  The big question is how long they hold up.  I'll revise if I need to later but really decent headphones when you're not looking to spend hundreds.,0
5.0,"Easy to pair, comfy, good sound quality","November 26, 2018",Yes,These headphones are very comfortable. The sound quality is very good for my needs. They pair  very easily with my iPhone and my iPad. Would recommend.,0
5.0,Syncs quickly Long Batt life,"February 26, 2018",Yes,I'm a contractor who works alone. These are great for comfortably listening to audio books or podcast for hours on end. It Bluetooth syncs quickly with my phone without any action by me except turning it on.(which is super important to me.)  The battery life is phenomenal. I'm pretty sure I've used them 3 times or more between charges. I hope this helps.,0
5.0,5 stars,"August 11, 2018",Yes,"I already purchased the black version of this item and I can’t be more happy , it’s off very good quality and the price is very fair . My teenagers nephews love the design and sounds .",0
4.0,Updated!,"August 9, 2018",Yes,"I've had this product for 5 months and the buttons are sunk in making it almost impossible to push them. The head cushion is falling apart. The material came out of the seam, exposing the foam underneath. I'm not too impressed with these headphones...Update, the company backed their product and sent me a replacement which is working great.",0
5.0,The fold up design makes it easy to store in a bag when i am on ...,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"So far im really enjoying these headphones. The fold up design makes it easy to store in a bag when i am on the move. It has a long battery life, i work 12 hour shifts and its nice to have it last the whole time. The ear portion is very comfortable as it doesnt sit right on my ear as other have. I would have like to get a little more bass like a previous pair i had but the sound quality is still really good.",0
5.0,Great for the price,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these are great! I have had these for a few months now without any issue. They obviously aren't super high quality, but like I said, they are well worth the price. They are comfy and the battery life is good. I'd recommend them.",0
5.0,These are great for the price!,"December 29, 2017",Yes,Love these things. I originally bought a cheaper $25 pair off amazon which broke within 3 months (stopped charging). Just pay the extra money and get these! I work in a cubicle office with a bunch of people-and when I need to get a bunch of work done (or annoying coworkers) these are life savers!,0
5.0,11 year old loves them!,"September 17, 2018",Yes,"My kid loves them. Batteries last nearly all day, he isn't gentle with things and they've held up well. No discernible damage or wear-and-tear. Has had them for 6+ months now and they look brand new and work that way too.",0
5.0,"It is SO GOOD, I'm throwing my other headphones and speakers to trash","March 9, 2018",Yes,"very comfortable on the ears and head. warning though, my head's not big, but I need the headphone to extend to the max length, so if you have a big head, you may not feel comfortable. Sound quality is SUPERB",0
5.0,I'm very pleased. These look and feel better than any pair ...,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"I'm very pleased.  These look and feel better than any pair of headphones I've ever owned.  I specifically purchased them because I needed a wireless headset.  I still haven't tested the wireless functionality, but these would be worth the price even as a wired pair of headphones...Would buy from this company again.",0
1.0,Terrible,"July 13, 2017",Yes,I've had these for less than a week and they already don't work. Terrible product,2
5.0,Great buy,"August 8, 2017",Yes,"Bought these for my 9 year old and  he loves them. They look good, easy to use, and has great sound. I liked these so much I bought them for my teenage daughter and my husband asked for a pair. These are really nice and the quiet isolation they give is impressive. Great deal!!",0
5.0,Work perfectly and comfortably!,"April 18, 2018",Yes,"This is my first experience with Bluetooth over-the-ear headphones.  They arrived quickly and were easy to pair and make operational.  They fit very comfortably and do not bounce or move while I exercise.  I could not be happier.  I've only had them about a week so I can not say how well they will perform over the coming months.  Especially for the price, these are everything I hoped they would be.",0
3.0,Meh,"February 18, 2018",Yes,Does not connect reliably. I lose the Bluetooth connection every so often. Sound quality is ok.,1
4.0,First things first - I love these headphones,"October 29, 2017",Yes,"First things first - I love these headphones.  I use them at home, at work, awake, sleeping, doing the dishes, etc. etc. etc.  They are snug so don't feel like they are going to fall off as you move your head around.  The battery lasts a long time, and being able to connect to two different sources at once is great...I haven't had any issues, but the control buttons do feel a bit like they could be a problem later -- they don't have as solid a feel as I would like and I feel like they could break...But these headphones are great, and exactly what I was hoping for.",0
5.0,Great headphones for the price,"June 7, 2018",Yes,"I got these for my 12 year old son and he loves them. They pair easily to his phone. They sound great, are comfortable, durable and the battery life is excellent.",0
5.0,Great wireless headphones,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"Excellent sound quality and a good deal of noise cancellation.  I've been wearing these while trying to study for a class and the extreme levels of noise coming from my 8 &amp; 3 year-olds has been significantly reduced.  I should have got these a long time ago!  A single charge lasts a really long time, which is also great.",0
5.0,Cheap and Extremely Effective for the cost,"August 5, 2018",Yes,"I usually don't write reviews, but having worn this pair for over a year and a half, the price + quality are quite simply excellent for the price. Note, it isn't active noise cancellation, but with music playing, it usually drowns out other noise. Bass isn't the best in the world, but it's quite good!",1
1.0,Did not work,"August 3, 2018",Yes,Did not work,1
5.0,Terrible static after 6 months,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"After 6 months they sound really bad. Thick static that makes them unbearable to use...Edit: They quickly respinded to my issue and without me even asking sent me a brand new pair! The quality was awesome for the first 6 months, so hopefully I just had a pair go bad. It's good to see a brand stand behind their product.",0
4.0,Wow this are great!,"October 27, 2017",Yes,I’ve been using this since yesterday and it sounds top notch and Bluetooth is super fast too! It’s comfortable and it’s only 30 bucks!,2
5.0,solid and easy controls to work with,"December 25, 2017",Yes,"I bought this for my wife, so that she can listen to Christmas music all the time.  She likes the headphones.  Very well made, solid and easy controls to work with.  She is very happy for with her Christma Present.",0
4.0,Headphones work great and are very comfortable,"January 2, 2018",Yes,Headphones work great and are very comfortable. Love the convenience of being able to fold them tight for travel and also use bluetooth to connect so no wires get in the way. Only problem is your phone has to be somewhat close to you or music gets disrupted,1
3.0,Good enough for price,"November 20, 2017",Yes,Quality of sound is ok. A little fuzzy especially when music is louder or if music is in a higher range. My headphones have skipped a couple times when connected via Bluetooth almost sounds like a record skipping...Wish sound could be louder as it is not noise cancelling so I can still hear a lot with the volume up almost all the way...When having a call it is nearly impossible to hear the other person and you can’t use the mic on the headphones if you are using he Aux cable...They are comfortable to wear and comfortable with glasses.,0
5.0,Pre-Teen approved!,"August 22, 2017",Yes,"I bought these for my 11 year old son. He loved them and wears them constantly. Maybe too much! :-) The quality is great and they seem very well built. I will repost if they can't handle the wear and tear of a pre-teen. So far, great!!!",0
4.0,Didn't have to send defective ones back - nice!!,"April 24, 2018",Yes,Nothing makes a more loyal customer than when you have a problem and the company bends over backwards to fix it!.These guys immediately sent me new headphones.  Didn't have to send defective ones back - nice!!,0
5.0,Tremendous value,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"These are great headphones for the paltry sum charged.  I bought them to use while doing yard work, working out, etc., with the thought I didn’t want to pay a bunch only to have them get scuzzed up.  Easy pairing, good sound, for $35 these are a steal.",0
5.0,"SOOO comfortable, and clean sound!","September 11, 2018",Yes,"Wow! The neighbors are having a redneck pickup jam across the road, and I’ve got these on! Awesome! I can’t hear anything but Elton John singing “Burn Down the Mission”! Yes! Another strong move toward serenity in the hood..Very comfortable to wear, simple to pair to my iPhone, and nicely designed control array..I’d buy these again in a HEARTBEAT..“....bring your family down to the riverside.........burn down the mission Lord......”😎",0
4.0,Audio is good for listening but mic is not so good,"July 8, 2017",Yes,"I bought these, hoping to replace my wired headset for gaming. While the audio quality coming in was very good, the mic is just bad. I am using it with Teamspeak and people are saying I sound like I am in a tunnel. Maybe I just got a defect set?..Update: A new headset was sent out and they worked better. Good for listening to music while mowing",0
2.0,Wireless no good,"December 8, 2017",Yes,No wireless function with laptop pc Bluetooth turned on. Contacted the seller by e-mail and I was only instructed to rebooted the item and check if it pairs. It pairs all right  with mobile phone but no wireless on the pc. I tried to contact the seller again by e-mail twice but there were no indication that the e-mails were submitted and so far I have no response. There was indication that the e-mail was submitted the first time...The wireless function still doesn't work on my laptop pc with the new headphone that was sent to me on 13/12/17.,0
3.0,Bluetooth problems...Updated,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"11/9 update:..Following the return of the second headphones and my review, Mpow sent a replacement and instructions for restoring to factor defaults. I have only had the replacement a couple weeks, but so far it is performing better for outdoor use than the two previous headphones. Indoor performance is decent, but not as good compared to the first set I bought. The headphones are more sensitive to interference from Wi-Fi and objects than I would prefer. For example, being near my laptop affects performance at times, causing momentary interruptions during page loads or downloads over Wi-Fi. In other situations not involving my laptop, performance may start fine but I hear more interruptions in playback over time. (I guess it could be interference from close neighbors networks or devices, but that's not something I would choose to spend much effort trying to avoid just for these headphones). Usually restoring solves the problems for a time. The improvement is enough that I have upgraded my rating from 2 to 3-3.5. I feel that if I had purchased this replacement I would feel comfortable keeping it, and it is nice to have responsive customer service...Original:..I had to return two sets in the past couple months due to very poor bluetooth connection. The features and price seemed right for my purposes, so I wanted them to work. They looked fine, and the sound quality was okay. The cushions sat comfortably around my ears, not on ears, and there was no problem with my glasses. It was relatively easy to pair them to my phone and tablet, although I thought the controls were too hit or miss. I accidently powered off numerous times while pressing the button and trying to count the seconds and half seconds between options. I could leave my devices and walk around the house without dropping the connection. However, as soon as I got three or four steps from the house, with a device right on me, the connection turned horrible. Music would play for five seconds and cut out for two. The headphones would show up multiple times in the list of paired devices. I half suspected the headphones were trying to connect to other devices around the homes I passed by. Being a glutton for punishment and in disbelief about headphones that worked well indoors, I let this go on for 10 minutes or so. Then for no reason I could discern, they might play fine during the rest of my walk. I tried this a number of times, and the same thing happened every time. The wired connection is not an option for my phone and I really wanted something for outdoor use, so I could not keep the headphones. With the second set, they also worked great indoors. The connection problems outdoors were not as pronounced, though there were moments. What made me send those back was that the controls would stop responding at times - I could not repeat or advance tracks or stop playback at times. I never even got around to call handling with either set. I have to give these low marks for quality control...I just started wearing the Skullcandy Hesh2 headphones and don't have the problems with Bluetooth connection outdoors. I don't think the sound quality or comfort are any better than the Mpows for the money, but at least they work.",2
5.0,Good sound quality,"August 4, 2017",Yes,"They were for my fiance. Her old pair of headphones got broke and was hard for me to look at, so I got her this and she loves them. I tried them out too and must say it performs really well. Good sound quality, decent build and they can get pretty loud (for those of you that like blasting your ears. Fits snuggly and comfortably, giving it the potential of being used at the gym. Honestly, if I hadn't already ordered a pair of good headphones a couple weeks prior, I'd have ordered these for myself too, especially given the  price.",0
4.0,"Good sound, horrible mic","November 9, 2018",Yes,The quality of sound in these are really good but where they fall short is the mic. If you're buying these to make calls or play games on Discord (why I bought them) you'll sound horrible because the mic is a pinprick within the plastic. Its nice not having the mic sticking out because I have cats that chewed on my last one but the quality is extremely hurt. Great for listening to music on the go though.,0
5.0,Great headphones,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"Easy to use, adjustable, why pay more? Nice to have when you want to listen to music when someone else is in the room watching TV.",0
5.0,but it was so easy to pair it to my phone,"August 12, 2017",Yes,"So far I have been very impressed by this headset. Usually there is some sort of trick to get Bluetooth devices to pair up, but it was so easy to pair it to my phone. The range on this also is great. I use it mostly for exercise. I can get up to 50 feet away and still comes through clear.",0
4.0,My son loves them.,"May 23, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my toddler son. He is 3 and trying to use in ear headphones was a challenge. They look big on him but he loves listening to his music through them.,0
5.0,love the short charge / long battery usage time and ...,"April 8, 2018",Yes,"Got this for my 10 year old son  who is hard wearing on most things , its been a few months now and they are still going strong , love the short charge / long battery usage time and the range isnt too shabby  :)",0
2.0,Definitely disappointed.,"December 30, 2017",Yes,Sound quality is decent but I just recently purchased this and have barely used it and it shorts out randomly throughout my music. It's a quick short out. But it's very irritating. Definitely disappointed.,0
4.0,Headphones on initial inspection seem well made and sturdy. The only reason I gave them 4 instead ...,"November 7, 2017",Yes,Headphones on initial inspection seem well made and sturdy.  The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is that they were a gift for my son and he has had a bit of trouble pairing them but once paired they work great.,0
3.0,Bulky and not that great in terms of sound,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"Was a bit too heavy and bulky for my tastes...not much on hte side of bass either, so i returned it.",1
1.0,Uncomfortable,"May 6, 2018",Yes,"I don't like these they aren't comfortable at all. I've only been wearing them for 30 min and they hurt my head. The sound is okay, but it's pretty brassy. I'm going to return them",0
5.0,"Good quality, user friendly. I would suggest it to buy.","February 19, 2018",Yes,"This is by far the best bang for the buck wireless headset. Very good battery life. Comfortable. Very good quality. The power on/off sounds and pairing sounds makes it user friendly. Not the best noise cancellation compared to really expensive headsets but still you do not hear outside noise. At high volume, and in really quite place, nearby people will hear the music you are listening to. Medium volume, no one is goinf to hear you and you dont hear anything but the music. Enjoy...",0
5.0,Great deal on good headphones,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"Hands-down best deal for Bluetooth over the ear headphones, very happy with the first pair but second pair for my daughter because she was jealous of my son’s headphones.",0
4.0,Hard to beat the price for the quality,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"Very comfortable and like the way they fold. For the price very hard to beat. Would have liked a little bit more mid range sound, but overall a great buy and would recommend highly.",0
4.0,Great quality for the price,"March 29, 2018",Yes,"Sound is good, can hear a little bit of outside noise but not too much. Fit is good, adjustment is easy to find the right fit. Only big issue I got them to workout in and my ears do get super hot in them hotter than with other brands over over the ear headphones.",0
3.0,They are .... ok for the price.,"October 16, 2018",Yes,They are ok. I bought them for when I lift at the gym and they keep sliding off my head. I also hadn’t realized how bulky they are. (My ears get really hot as well!),0
5.0,"comfortable, sound is very good especially for the price","February 7, 2018",Yes,"comfortable, sound is very good especially for the price. easy to pair on my new Samsung 75"" tv and phone. bought a pair for my brother who likes as well. I would buy them again. great price.",0
5.0,"Great price, sound, and hold a charge FOREVER!!!","June 6, 2018",Yes,"Holy cow! These are AMAZING headphones. Hubby bought them for himself, and he says they're super comfortable, have great sound, and he has charged them THREE TIMES in the SEVERAL MONTHS that he's had them! He uses them for two-four hours per night! We are very impressed. :) This is a GREAT price for some high-quality headphones.",0
5.0,Great budget Bluetooth with good wireless and sound range,"March 9, 2017",Yes,"My first over the ear headphones. My third headphones from MPow. So far only had them a few hours, but really like them...Pros.This pair gives much better range in sound (bass, etc) than the earbud MPow models I've used. (Cheetah and Antelope) The build feels sturdy; I don't feel like they'll snap. Yet they're still quite lite...I've walked around my office with a lot of fluorescent lights, laptops, and metal, and gotten good range for Bluetooth...Right out of the box they had charge to pair and play. Charged them for a bit this morning, and they've been going strong for about an hour...Cons.It's hard to tell when you reach up to the controls what you're touching. It would be nice if there was a bump or something to give you a sense of what you were touching. Not worth dropping a star for..You do have to be careful placing them on your head to not put undue pressure, especially with glasses. That said, if I'm careful, I feel very little pressure, and no pinch points..Could use a little more bass, but it's good for Bluetooth on a budget.",3
5.0,Great for my 3rd grader,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"Just what my son needed - no more issues with cords and he's happy! We use with an ipad 4, and it has been just what we needed.",1
4.0,"This is very rigid plastic but works and feels great. Definitely for home use not for working out it is not very sturdy, or dura","February 18, 2018",Yes,"This is very rigid plastic but works and feels great. Definitely for home use not for working out it is not very sturdy, or durable. Besides that it’s a great product with good range and comfortable earpieces.",0
5.0,Loving these!,"October 3, 2017",Yes,"These are perfect. I use these at work mostly in the office and they have great sound. Long range for reception and are very comfortable. Shipping was very fast. They sound as good as the beats headphones, to me. I really got a deal with these. Great headphones!",0
5.0,Did not expect an awesome headphone for this price,"August 28, 2018",Yes,"Love the color, the comfort, the material, and the sound quality...Im one of those guys who love the bass, and this is just perfect for these headsphones, im able to hear crystal clear the audio as well. Would not recommend for workouts though coz it slowly slids off from the head movements during workout.",0
4.0,Grt product but..,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"It's a good product, sound is decent. But I mainly use this to watch TV shows, but after a while the sound on the TV and headphone loses the sync, where the mouth movement and the sound that you'll hear doesn't match up.",0
1.0,Fake reviews?,"February 22, 2018",Yes,I question whether this product can actually have that many reviewers! Especially since these headphones are super heavy and hurt my head after 5 minutes of use. The sound is great and the construction looks quality. But these are sooooo uncomfortable! I sent them back.,1
5.0,Terrific sound quality and ruggedly built for less money!,"October 29, 2017",Yes,"I love this set of Bluetooth stereo headphones. I’ve had headphones that were much more expensive; but, built with cheaper more flimsy parts. This set is ruggedly built and provides the same or better sound quality. A must buy!",0
5.0,The headphones are great. I bought a pair on the prime day ...,"July 21, 2017",Yes,This is the second pair of Mpow Bluetooth headphones I have bought from Patozon. The headphones are great. I bought a pair on the prime day sale that had the same specifications as the Mpow but they were nowhere near as good and lost signal at around 18ft. these Mpow phones from Patozon are excellent and maintain the signal up to 30+ft. very happy repeat buyer.,0
5.0,Wow!,"October 25, 2018",Yes,I’m very happy with these.  The battery life is outstanding.  Can go a week between heavy use before I need to charge it.  Great headphones!,0
5.0,Not great for me,"September 16, 2017",Yes,"Not so great.these were very uncomfortable (too tight and smashed on ear lobes) and I thought the sound was terrible, kind of muffled - talking on the phone not good either.",1
5.0,Like champ %100,"November 1, 2017",Yes,"I order this head phone for my video editing,And they work real good. noise cancellation is real good. Sound is real good via Bluetooth, it has a strong bass. the design is solid and strong. battery is real good too. Highly recommend MPOW. also I have the Cheetah sport and they work like champ. very comfortable also  Plus the company will work with you if you have any problems. Satisfaction %100.",5
5.0,Great for the cost,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Good quality for the cost, work well so far. You need to keep in mind, your not purchasing a high end set. My use is light, just wanted a set so my wife can sleep while I listen to whatever.",0
5.0,Excellent Quality for the Price,"February 2, 2018",Yes,Below is my old review.I got a replacement pair and they work incredibly well. MPOW Headphones are amazing and I highly recommend them to any who is considering picking up a pair for themselves...These worked amazing for the time I've been wearing them. But now sometimes they create an incredibly loud static sound. I'm surprised I'm not deaf by now. I'd appreciate it if the manufacturers have a solution to this. They were awesome but I cannot use these like this.,0
5.0,Great value for the money,"July 6, 2018",Yes,"Great value for the money, they stay charged forever. Sound quality is very good. Not the most comfortable if you wear while laying down, but definitely worth the price.",0
5.0,Great Bluetooth Headphones,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"Good quality, great sound, use it with my satellite TV, i like the rechargeable feature no batteries needed, blue tooth connection is easy, comfortable to wear for long periods of time",0
5.0,"Comfortable, wireless, good value","December 18, 2017",Yes,"These do not have any notable 'noise canceling' feature but they do a good job of blocking outside sound; have good audio quality and Bluetooth works well (at least, with my Laptop Lenovo/Windows there has been no issues so far).",0
5.0,Paired with PC easily,"April 27, 2018",Yes,I was looking for affordable bluetooth headphones to use at work.  This set from Mpow is great.  They paired quickly and easily with my computer and are very comfortable.,0
5.0,Great headphones for the price,"April 18, 2018",Yes,Great headphones for the price. My son loves them!..Review was edited because I unfortunately confused these with another brand of headphone that stopped working. These are great.,0
4.0,Flight,"March 6, 2018",Yes,Seems to be a perfectly good product.  I used it on a flight this past weekend and it seemed to cancel out noise well.  It's only a 4 star for now as I'd need more time to give it a higher grade.,0
5.0,GREAT HEADPHONES,"February 10, 2018",Yes,"I've had these for a little over a month now and they're really great! I use them when I paint and workout mostly so I love that they have a Bluetooth option, as well as controls on the actual headset so I can set my phone down and focus on whatever I'm doing! The charge lasts a really long time and they're reallllly loud! Highly recommend!",0
1.0,One Star. Sent one pair back now second pair defective.,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"After 3rd use, headphones would not work nothing but static while using wire. I sent them back for a replacement. Seller would not refund full amount of cost to ship back to them. Received second pair and now I am getting the same static problem with wire. SMH what a waste of Money.",0
1.0,BUYER BEWARE! I bought these headphones a couple of ...,"June 1, 2018",Yes,"BUYER BEWARE!.I bought these headphones a couple of months in advance for my son's birthday.  When he unwrapped them and tried them out, they didn't work.  I emailed Mpow over a month ago and still haven't heard back from them..BUYER BEWARE!",1
4.0,Great for the price,"April 26, 2017",Yes,These headphones are comfortable and connect quickly to my Apple TV and MacBook Pro and iPhone 7.  The controls on the right side are easy to use. The sound is pretty good but sounds more muffled than clear.  I wish it had more treble.  But for the price they sound pretty good and I would highly recommend them.,0
5.0,Great for the money,"July 14, 2017",Yes,Great for the money. Music sound quality is very good. Once paired have not had the signal drop...Pairing is not a hassle but sometimes requires some finesse to get the button pressed right. Maybe it should have a separate pairing button.,0
5.0,daughter loves them and they work great wired or wireless,"February 14, 2018",Yes,daughter loves them and they work great wired or wireless.  These replaced Bose that we sent back twice within 30 days.  These have been working for over a month already with no issues.,0
5.0,Great budget headset,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"Love this headset. Because cups sit over my ears, I can comfortably have it on for hours. Connection versatility is great also (bluetooth or cable) as I can never be bothered to remember to recharge devices until the moment I need to use them. Can't comment on sound quality, except to say ""it's fine""; I'm by no means a professional or an audiophile. No complaints about sound volume or clarity. This headset does make one look like a chobit, which some may find charming and others not so much :)",0
5.0,Great sound and battery life,"April 25, 2018",Yes,This is a great product. The headphones have a great battery life. I usually only have to charge them every few days and I use them all the time. They are a nice fit so if I'm lying back they don't feel like they're going to fall off. I like the controls because they have separate volume buttons and track-skip buttons.,0
5.0,"2 options, and it folds up!","November 11, 2018",Yes,"Love the wired/wireless feature. Recently upgraded phone that doesn’t have the jack, so it was easy to switch over with Bluetooth (after a few tries). It does have a light that blinks when it’s on, so in the dark I can see it flash when I have it in, but sound is great, a design that folds is awesome, and the color is fun.",0
5.0,These are excellent headphones. I bought them for use at work ...,"February 3, 2018",Yes,"These are excellent headphones.  I bought them for use at work to drown our peripheral office noise, and they work very well.  They can be worn for long periods of time with comfort, and the battery life is very good.  Highly recommended.",0
4.0,Above average performance.,"December 30, 2017",Yes,"Overall the product delivers what was expected.  Given the price-point, the comfort was above expected but the audio quality matched the cost.  If you are looking for Bose or Beats quality audio you will need to spend more.  Distance wise, the bluetooth does not allow for the maximum 33ft if you are in another room(not direct line of sight).  I tested it through two interior walls and it began to cut out at about 25ft.  I have yet to use this as a hands-free calling device.",0
2.0,Medium. Not great at high volume,"March 21, 2018",Yes,Too much distortion at higher volumes. I guess to be expected from cheaper headphones. Second pair I tried from this company. Never again.,1

5.0,Great value,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Bought these looking for decent affordable headphones and that is exactly what I got. They get the job done without breaking the bank. If you're not looking for anything crazy and just want some functional over ear headphones these will do the trick.,0
5.0,Incredible value,"August 1, 2018",Yes,"when I read about these it sounded too good to be true,  but they truly sound as good as some of the really expensive over-the-ear headphones, comfortable excellent design amazing sound unbelievable price",0
5.0,Great balanced sound and battery life,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"Got it for Christmas, and battery finally died on 1/10 after listening for a few hours every day.  The sound is great with balance, unlike certain phones that are tuned for only bass and low end.  Easy to use",0
5.0,Best price and quality,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"Loved them, good external noise cancelling, easy to connect to my phone, controls are easy, sound is good quality, stores away easily but the best part is definitely the price. Can't be matched!",0

5.0,Very comfortable with decent noise canceling,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are very comfortable and block outside noise well. I often do work in communal office space, and these work perfectly to help me focus. The headphones go over and around my whole ear, so they sit against my head rather than smashing my ear. Decent sound for the money, although that was less important to me than the noise canceling. These were also easy to pair with my old MacBook Pro, and connect automatically when I turn them on now.",0
4.0,Great customer service,"November 22, 2017",Yes,"I had a problem with the first pair of headphones I purchased. The battery would no longer charge after 3 weeks. I was really annoy d because I could no longer return the item, so I left a negative review. The manufacturer responded the very next day and had a new pair out to me within a week. New headphones are great and I’m a happy camper! Keep up the good work!",1
5.0,Great,"March 27, 2018",Yes,Nice color cheap price and sound get I was intending to buy some jamz wireless headphones but they want too much for the color I wanted so I bought these instead and I'm glad I did.,0
5.0,Great especially if you can't wear earbuds,"May 24, 2018",Yes,My wife can't wear earbuds because they are too uncomfortable. She likes these quite a bit and can wear them for awhile. Helps pass the time on the train with music.,0
5.0,Works without issues,"December 25, 2017",Yes,Bought these for a 9 yr old boy who I didn’t trust with more expensive wireless headphones. He loves these and they work great. No connection problem and they’ve lasted 7 mos and counting with 9 year old boy use. Happy,0
4.0,Pretty good!,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality pretty good for the price! Comfortable and lightweight, not enough bass for me personally. Set up was easy, however the range isn't that far, started to cut away at about 10ft.",0

1.0,Defective product,"June 21, 2018",Yes,"I purchased these headphones in February.  Now with minimal usage and no abuse, the right phone is dead and carries no sound.  These were far  more expensive than cheap ear buds; I expected them to last much longer...I received a second pair, and once again the right headphone/speaker is dead.  The sound is totally wrong, missing certain instruments and ranges of sound.  Horrid product.",0
4.0,Solid set of Bluetooth headphones,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality is good, not great, but good value for the cost. They block external noise well and also seal well - I use them in an office space and nearby coworkers can’t hear my music, even with the volume up fairly loud.",0
5.0,Nice product. Great surround sound isolation,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"I found it just a little too heavy. But nice and solid product, perhaps the reason for the little extra weight.  I do recommend it",0

5.0,Great!,"February 27, 2018",Yes,I love these headphones. I bought them because I will be getting hearing aids shortly and needed some like this. Tried them out and worked great. My kids tried them too and went one too.,0

5.0,Amazing sound quality!,"February 5, 2018",Yes,"The sound quality is amazing! I've never had headphones like these, since I usually gravitate towards Bluetooth earbuds, and I've been changed. I see why people love these peices. The fit is perfectly snug around my ears and is quite noise dampening. My only complaint is that the ear part seemed large on my head, as if they petrouded outwards too far, but that could be just from my inexperience with this style. I still highly recommend!",0
4.0,Good quality headphones but comfort will probably be an issue for most...,"June 12, 2017",Yes,"Good headphones for the price. Very satisfied with the build and sound quality. My only gripe is that they are not the most comfortable pair of headphones out there. The headphones are a bit heavy and the ear cups are a bit small, causing slight soreness of your ears after prolonged use...Edit: After a couple days of use. I'm starting to feel regret over this purchase. No matter how I adjust these headphones, they become uncomfortable very quickly. I have an average size head and ears for an adult male. I'll leave the 4 star rating as is because I like everything else about these headphones, but the comfort is a real issue for me.",0
5.0,"Feel kinda cheap, but they work great","November 23, 2018",Yes,"Got these to replace the old cord headphones. Huge upgrade, keeps playing music from my computer when I'm halfway across the building.",0
1.0,One Star,"April 17, 2018",Yes,You could hear the music so loud outside of the headphones even when the volume wasn't that loud.,1
4.0,They paired easily with the transmitter on the tv and sounded very ...,"May 10, 2017",Yes,"Okay, I got these to watch tv in the next room when my wife and I are watching separate shows. They paired easily with the transmitter on the tv and sounded very nice. They are comfortable and really do a good job of blocking out other noise when turned up a little. It still held the signal as I would walk to the kitchen (aprx. 20 feet}. There is a very slight hum when there is no volume which is why I give it 4 stars. I didn't notice it at all when volume is up. I am very happy with my headphones.",0
5.0,Great value for the price point.,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"More than pleasantly surprised. These popped up in an Amazon feed and I thought, why not. Battery life and sound are not far off of the beats we bought my daughter for Christmas. I use them working out and they work great.",0
5.0,6 weeks of use and don’t work,"April 24, 2018",Yes,Edit:  the seller was kind enough to send me another pair that work great!  Fingers crossed!..I bought these on March 3 and it is April 22nd and they no longer work without being plugged in which defeats the purpose. I would have thought they would last longer than this! It’s a shame because I really liked them.,0
5.0,Great!,"November 2, 2018",Yes,The ears phones were as advertised. Bought them for my wife and she has been using them every night. She loves them!..Joe C.,0
5.0,A total win,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"For $40 these are a total win. No they aren’t Beats or Bose, but they’re Bluetooth and sound more than decent. No more wires getting tangled when I’m lifting weights. Love them. Very comfortable and adjustable.",0
5.0,Five Stars,"March 10, 2018",Yes,"Comfortable, good sound. Seems to  connect quickly. My only (very minor) complaint is the sound isolation. I can hear things in the room a little more than my other headphones and my wife says she can sometimes hear the music I'm listening to.",0
5.0,Awesome,"January 3, 2018",Yes,"These by far are the best headphones I have owned. I was blown away by the look, feel and sound quality. Extremely easy to use and set up. I really like that they give you a nice cloth carry case, charger and adapter to connect direct to your device. I honestly feel I got 10 times the product for the price.",0
2.0,Bluetooth Issue,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"I was excited to get the wireless Bluetooth pair for the office. They lasted 4 hours and I assumed they died, but actually they will no longer pair with my iphone. When they arrived yesterday there wasn't an issue. Charged all night. Turned on when I got to work and the Bluetooth no longer works. I've read the Q&amp;A and they still will not pair.",1
5.0,My wife loves them.,"April 26, 2018",Yes,"She works in a factory that lets them listen to music on the floor. So these get at minimum 4, up to 6 hours use per night. She’s had them a couple of months now and they’re still great.",0
5.0,Amazing quality!,"March 16, 2018",Yes,Best Priced Bluetooth headphones HANDSDOWN have had them for almost 5 months and abused them and used them and strill work perfect and sound quality is fantastic as well as comfortable!,0
5.0,Great value blue tooth headphones,"March 27, 2018",Yes,"I bought these based strictly on value and buyer reviews to get a good bang for the buck. I had a little trouble figuring out the on off and sync, but really quite easy once i looked at the instructions. I blue tooth them with my iphone music, they sound fantastic and way more comfortable over the ears than many other higher end products that squeeze to hard against the ears. I’m impressed and recommend!",0
5.0,Sounds better than my Dre Beats,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"Sounds better than my Dre Beats, plus does more!!!!!!!!!!  Can use cord when Bluetooth is dead. Fits over ear, but not to tight. Had product since December 2017 and really enjoy the sound and the ability to use the cord or Bluetooth. Sturdy great sounding over the ear headphones. I purchase for my daughters and they love it; maybe a little to much.",0
4.0,Great Customer Service,"November 16, 2017",Yes,"Wow!  Great sounding headphones for this price range.  They pair quickly and have a long range for blu tooth.  They're very comfortable too.  Unfortunately first pair had blu tooth issues, but second pair work perfectly..What was truly impressive was the high level of customer service I received resolving the issue on the first pair.  They were quick to handle the issue and responded to all emails professionally and within 24 hours..I  would definitely recommend.",0
4.0,Very comfortable. I've had these for three weeks now and,"November 16, 2017",Yes,"Very comfortable. I've had these for three weeks now and, if I slept on my back, I could wear them sleeping. They get nice and loud, no complaints. Definitely great sound for 35 bucks, and I probably would be happy if I paid 50. They don't feel too cheap when I fold them up, but obviously they're not really made to be durable. I'll update this review when they break, so if this is still up then they're not broken yet.",0
3.0,Returned but Decent for Price,"April 19, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are comfortable and have a decent sound quality for the price. However, for music listeners these headphones are nothing special. They also have no sound canceling properties and anyone around you can hear exactly what you’re listening to. Furthermore, they feature an incredibly annoying flashing light which is irritating if you need to use your headphones in the dark. For these reasons, I returned this purchase.",0
4.0,Good,"April 22, 2018",Yes,Arrived fully charged which was surprising. Easy to set up. Great sound when listening to music. When using on calls however sounds like both parties are in a tunnel; not perfect but manageable...These cover your ears completely and are comfortable to wear for long periods.,0
5.0,Love these! Bought 4 pairs for my kids,"September 21, 2018",Yes,"Love these! Bought 4 pairs for my kids.... they ignore me constantly, telling me how they “can’t hear”, so they block out noise well",0
5.0,I have been so happy with these headphones,"November 3, 2017",Yes,I have been so happy with these headphones.  The charge lasts days for me using them for a few hours a day. They are comfortable on my head and ears; I forget I'm wearing them sometimes. And the sound quality is great.,0
3.0,Not for when you are with others,"October 11, 2018",Yes,I returned these- the sound was good but it “leaked out”  considerably. I thought they would be annoying to another person in the room.,0
4.0,"Decent headphones...bought w/my money, not an exchange review","April 2, 2017",Yes,"Updated 4/25/17: I bumped these up to four stars from three bc in my efforts to find another quality, inexpensive comfortable pair, I've appreciated these more. Just bought a second pair for my Mommy and she enjoys them as well. They no longer feel heavy, I was just used to the light comfort of Beats. These do loosen over time, they are a bit wobbly now but still seem structurally fine...+.Nice volume.Mostly comfy fit and I've slept in them.Easy, functional controls.Good range with very minimal cutting in and out.Easy to pair.Pairs with my TV (with a Bluetooth transmitter) and phone at the same time (whichever pairs first is what you'll hear).Big head friendly...mostly.There's a voice vs just beeps to tell me it's pairing, powering off etc.Does block out a lot of sound...in my home with noisy neighbors and  when I have the volume up, I do not hear them at all.Decent bass and clarity though nothing special.Pretty good battery life, very good actually.Ear fits comfortably inside the cups, I have small/medium sized ears.Ears do not get sore after long term use.The overall sound quality is pretty good..-.The sound leaks horribly even at lower levels so I cannot with a clear conscience wear these on the bus to block out the loud people I'd become if I used them.I have a big head and fear they will break if pulled too far/much.Sometimes when I'm eating, the headphones sit on my jawline making it uncomfy to open my mouth.Can be a tad uncomfortable and quite heavy on the head but I adjust.When I'm listening to classical music there's too much treble and bass making it screech even at level 1.The Bluetooth works okay sometimes but you have to talk loudly to be heard.Even though it humors me, these get wonky near the microwave and if the microwave is on and I'm within ten feet, it'll cut out..I like these and would buy again if the ones I have last a long time. We know it's becoming difficult to trust reviews of those that receive free/discounted items. I did not. Purchased these at full price in hopes it was not a regretful purchase. I haven't any regrets.",16
5.0,Long battery life,"October 13, 2018",Yes,Purchased this product more than 6 months ago and I absolutely love it! The battery life is great and it's super convenient to travel with.,0
5.0,Quality headphones for a great price,"April 30, 2018",Yes,SUPER COMFORTABLE!!! THEY FEEL UNBELIEVABLE. Sound quality is there. Bass is good(not great) but i think its perfect for the aound to be the quality it is. Had no trouble pairing and serting it up. As easy as 1-2-3. Would def recommend,0
5.0,Excellent product.,"January 13, 2018",Yes,"Excellent product.. great sound  quality, comfortable, nice looking and well made.. so appreciate the seller’s follow up reminders and instructions regarding warranty and function.. great customer service .",0
5.0,Worth it!,"April 23, 2017",Yes,"Been using them for a week, only minor issue I have is how one button does several things. Unless I'm doing it wrong the on/off/pair button are all the same. So when you turn off the headset it starts to pair then shuts off a sec later. Not a big issue, would of preferred another button for the pairing.",0
5.0,Exceeds expectations,"December 26, 2017",Yes,"This was a gift to a grand child. She likes it. Says the sound is great. Synced up without any problem. If the battery life is poor, I'll come back and add a supplemental review. Shipping was right on time. Packing was better than expected.",0
5.0,Really like these things so far,"May 23, 2018",Yes,"Really like these things so far. Very comfortable and a great sound. I mostly use them at work plugged into my computer, and I wish the cable was a little longer.",0
5.0,I just received these headphones today and I love them!,"February 12, 2018",Yes,"I just received these headphones today and I love them!! Used them thru Bluetooth for about 3 hours out of the box. Was easy to pair to my IPhone 7plus with Bluetooth, took only seconds. The sound can’t be beat for the price. I listened to a variety of music and it all sounded great. I think for the price range these are in they are WELL worth it! I purchased the pink ones and they are so pretty!!",0
5.0,Super comfortable. Love these,"September 28, 2017",Yes,I've been using these several hours a day for several days at work and still haven't had to charge them. Super comfortable. Love these...I want to get a second pair to keep at home!,1

5.0,Great sound for the price!,"October 10, 2018",Yes,"Haven’t had them long enough to judge the battery life, but I’m very happy with the sound quality. My previous headphones wouldn’t charge any more, so I got these and suddenly heard what I’d been missing! It’s almost like I have a new music collection, because everything sounds brighter.  I’m listening to Mahler, who takes the orchestra to its limits, and I really feel I can hear everything.",0

4.0,Free pair for MPOW after the 1st set died.,"July 12, 2018",Yes,Died after 2 months. (UPDATE) The company has sent me a new pair of headphone for no charge. So far they are working. Lets hope the new pair hold up better than the last.,0
5.0,Excellent sound quality and connection time,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"The connection time is instant, the sound is fabulous, the ear muffs are comfortable. Love these headphones! I did have to let them stretch a little over night. When I first put them on they squeezed a little too much for me.",0
4.0,Very good sound with these headphones,"January 28, 2018",Yes,"Very good sound with these headphones, and keeps charge for very long time (I charge it once a week). Comfortable fit, just wish they were a bit tighter. My only issue is, when you accidentally increase the sound on headphones past maximum, voice alert is so loud it hurts - so I try to adjust volume on my cellphone only, not on the headphones.",0
5.0,These are as advertised. They seem to work very ...,"October 23, 2017",Yes,These are as advertised.  They seem to work very well as I have synced them with various devices and used the mini connector to my Roku remote for private listening watching TV.  I have no current complaints.,0
5.0,"NO STARS THERE TRASH,...JUNK ,JUNK","February 5, 2018",Yes,"Good headphones.well I thought they was after about a month there acting up won't turn off,, all,it wants to,do is pair your headphones and not turn off ..I say you get what u pay another pair of shitty headphones in the trash... DONTBUY THESE THERE NOT WORTH IT",0
5.0,Great budget choice,"March 31, 2018",Yes,"Sound Quality: 8.5.Battery Life: 10.Construction: 7.Comfort: 9.UX: 6..If you want quality headphones without breaking the bank, these are wonderful. My one and only complaint is the buttons are hard to distinguish when not looking at them, but really that's fairly minor in the grand scheme of things, and if you don't need super crazy good audio quality (or can't tell the difference), then these are probably good enough, at a pretty good price.",0
5.0,Great headphones for the money,"January 24, 2018",Yes,"Love the color and the fit is great. I have a small head which makes it difficult to find headphones that stay on. These do, and they are comfortable too. Sound is good and they're very easy to use.",0
5.0,Overall five star rating for a great product gets the job done and makes my workout ...,"October 22, 2017",Yes,After discovering this headphone I decided never to buy a more expensive one ever again. It would not make sense to buy beats when you have this one which works the same way and has a similar quality.  Overall five star rating for a great product gets the job done and makes my workout much more enjoyable.,0
1.0,Possibly the worst headphones in the market,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"If I could rate it lower I would. Possibly the worst headphones in the market. I can see most of these reviews being completely fake because the product simply does not live up to the flashy made up title. The sound is absolutely awful, i'm not sure if everyone's headphones came in like this but it sounded like I was underwater or deaf when I was using these headphones. It completely filtered out the mid end/ high end of the sound. I also can't see any Bluetooth products being any good until 2080.",0
5.0,Best Bluetooth Headset I Have Ever Had,"July 20, 2017",Yes,"Excellent product.  Especially like the voice status indicating what mode the headset is in, ie..""Power On"", ""Pairing"", ""Connected"" and ""Power Off"". Bluetooth sound is excellent quality unlike some devices which distort sound.  Craftsmanship is excellent.  Endurance time before having to remove headset to prevent excessive discomfort to the ears is acceptable.",0
5.0,"Comfortable, Great quality, Affordable","February 19, 2018",Yes,The headphones completely cover the ears and is very comfortable. My husband uses it for gaming (PS4) and he says you can hear all the background sounds in the game clearly. You can't beat this quality for the price.,0
5.0,Cheap and good,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"I give it five stars not because it is the best pair headphones on the market, but because for the price thry are pretty good.",0
5.0,GREAT,"June 21, 2017",Yes,Got these for my hubby so when I'm ready for bed the tv doesn't interrupt my sleep...AWESOME!!.Pairing was super easy &amp; he tells me they are super comfortable.  Thanks for helping this wife get a few extra zz's :),1
5.0,Perfect headphones for bluetooth,"November 30, 2017",Yes,"Perfect sound and perfect amount of bass when using bluetooth mode. I noticed if the volume is all the way up on headphones there is some static, turning the volume down a few notches on the headphones then turning up your device fixes that problem, in my case its a home audio receiver. They also hold a charge for a very long time. I think once theyre broken in a little they are comfortable but maybe not right at first.",0
4.0,I love my new headphones,"July 31, 2018",Yes,I love my new headphones.  They are comfortable to wear and I like the sound.  I do wish they were better at cancelling out the outside noise.  I would recommend them.,0
5.0,So I decided to try out these headphones and I love them! Sound is great,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"I almost bought another pair of Beats headphones but didn’t want to spend the $$. I broke both pairs I had before, each pair fell out of my gym bag and snapped. So I decided to try out these headphones and I love them! Sound is great. Fits comfortable. Connects easily and clearly to my phone. Cost is obviously a huge plus! Love them.",0
4.0,The sound is fantastic for the price,"May 25, 2018",Yes,"Four stars because there is any movement (the cord or just against your head) you can hear it.  The sound is fantastic for the price, but you do get what you pay for!",0
4.0,It's not bad.,"February 1, 2018",Yes,It's a decent product..I'm happy with the sound quality and it's comfortable to wear...The only problem I have with these bluetooth headphones is announcement volume is too loud and it doesn't seem adjustable..I don't touch volume control in this pair because the beeping sound it makes when it reaches the maximum volume hurts my ears.,0
1.0,Review changed to 1 star after a few months,"February 19, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have about a 4 month shelf life, and then they become bricks. My headset wont do anything but turn on and off, it will not connect to anything. Cheap headset, waste of money.",0
5.0,Excel work flies with Amazon Wirleess Music!,"July 13, 2017",Yes,"Excellent product as to fit, musical clarity and reasonably priced. Also, I was able to follow the instruction for non-computer savvy people like myself to set up the Blue tooth and then the wireless earphones. I highly recommend them and Amazon.",0
5.0,Love my blue tooth headphones,"July 24, 2018",Yes,Love my blue tooth headphones. My ears fit nicely inside the openings and they feel comfortable on my head. The sound quality is crisp and easy to hear.,0
5.0,Great product....especially for its price.,"September 23, 2018",Yes,"Ive had more expensive headphones that werent nearly as sturdy as these.  The sound quality is great as well, and just as good as some high end headphones.  Highly recommended!  10/10",0

We discovered that set to be defective and once Patozon was notified of the defective set, they immediately shipped a new set.  Thank YOU Patozon! This new set works perfectly, my daughter loves them..Mpow Headphones are well worth the purchase and are a better purchase as compared to the more expansive sets. Impressive body construction quality, noise-canceling ability, and sound quality.",0

5.0,Good sound and work well on a plan eve without ...,"October 23, 2017",Yes,Good sound and work well on a plan eve without noise cancelling feature.  I had then on for several hours and was comfortable most of the time.  No issues at all with connectivity or features as described.,0
5.0,Good headphones,"July 23, 2017",Yes,Received these on 7/13 &amp; have used them daily since. They connect quickly &amp; easily to my Kindle &amp; my phone.

And the price was right.6,0

5.0,Very comfortable and the sound is good,"December 7, 2017",Yes,Very comfortable and the sound is good. I love the fact that it is wireless and also can be wired. On a long travel day of flying the charge on the wireless may not last and the cord is a great backup. Other wireless headphones are only wireless,0
5.0,Love these! Synced with my tablet immediately,"April 16, 2018",Yes,Love these! Synced with my tablet immediately. Sound is good. Ear cushions are soft. I can walk all around my office listening to my music without being tethered to my tablet!,0
4.0,It's a good headphone. I like the sound and has a ...,"April 6, 2018",Yes,It's a good headphone. I like the sound and has a good bass. The buttons on right side feels cheap and sometimes hard to connect when you try to connect with multiple devices.,1
5.0,Good value,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"I wanted a pair of wireless headphones that can withstand the rigors or working out.  These seem to fit the bill.  Whether running, lifting, or hitting the heavy bag, these get the job done.  Comfortable, durable, and good sound quality.  Very pleased.",0
4.0,Pretty good headphone but you need to know the performance ...,"February 20, 2018",Yes,Pretty good headphone but you need to know the performance of the Bluetooth vs wired isn't the same. In Bluetooth mode the bass is flat. I would gladly sacrifice some battery life for increased bass. Overall for the price these are great.,0
5.0,"Seller, rectified the problem.","January 5, 2018",Yes,"After my initial product review, the compant reissued me another pair. Since receiving, I have no complaints. Good job.",1
5.0,Simplistic and cute,"August 6, 2018",Yes,Really like these headphones. They aren’t as sturdy as some of the $300 headphones out there but I don’t have a problem with them at all. I even let my little boy wear them after he broke off a piece of a wired earbud in the speaker jack of his iPad. Sound is good quality and I like that they fold up to put in my bag for work.,0
5.0,They are very comfortable.,"June 15, 2018",Yes,"I bought these to use when I mow hay. Our tractor is cabless, which is quite loud. I used them yesterday while mowing. I could still here the equipment running and hear my music. Excellent product so far.",0
2.0,Do not waste your money.,"December 5, 2018",Yes,Charged the battery and it lasted about an hour and would not charge again.  Instruction book is so small that I had to use a magnifier to read it.,0
1.0,They don't last long,"August 22, 2018",Yes,These things didn't last 6 months. Very disappointed. I used them maybe 4 times during the week with no real wear and tear. The first thing to go was the charge port. Very very disappointed,0
5.0,Greaaaat!,"November 24, 2017",Yes,"Great wireless headphones, super long battery life, well constructed... only issue or thing I had was the foam got a little uncomfortable after about a good hour of use, I don’t recommend using these for more than two hours, but overall great product.",0
5.0,Exemplary customer service!,"March 1, 2018",Yes,Model 059 - Too much bass.  Treble/bass not adjustable.  Fine for music with a LOT of bass but not at all useful for phone conversations..Patozon sent me a different model (H2) that was much better for my needs.  Exemplary customer service!,0
4.0,Pretty Good Headphones,"February 22, 2018",Yes,Not bad for the money connects to bluetooth very easy. Would give five stars if the volume got just a little bit louder. Have had them since November and they have held up to hard daily use. Battery life is excellent. Charges very easily and pretty fast.,0
5.0,SOUND is GREAT!!,"October 2, 2018",Yes,"GREAT headphones and the color PINK is what i have been looking for. The sound, color, and quality of them are AWESOME!!",0
4.0,GREAT BATTERY LIFE. BETTER THAN EXPECTED!,"May 17, 2018",Yes,Pretty cool. They’re been on the counter on n off for bout two weekS. NO CHARGING AT ALL. Using it bout an hour or so.

4.0,"Sound not as good as my HD 202, but good enough.","November 18, 2018",Yes,"They are fine for the price. Sound quality can be improved. Not as good as my HD 202, but it did not have Bluetooth.",0
1.0,"Sound is Okay, but functionality is pretty bad.","November 12, 2017",Yes,"The sound itself is okay, but when you're connected via Bluetooth and you want to hear in Stereo mode, you can't hear anything else if you have a Chrome tab open that has mic access...So if I'm on Google Hangouts or Discord with a tab open, ALL other sound will be muted. The only way to fix this is to go to ""Hands-Free"" mode which has absolutely garbage audio quality.",1
5.0,"Comfortable, versatile, decent sound","December 28, 2017",Yes,"Good sound for the price, but the better value is the versatility as both Bluetooth and wired capability.  Bought these for my son for Christmas to wear while he plays drums.  He says they are extremely comfortable and he can hardly hear anything outside of them when he's wearing them with the music playing.",0
5.0,"Great quality, love them!","November 17, 2017",Yes,"So far these headphones work great, I haven't really blasted the volume yet to see how they sound with loud volume but the quality so far is far more than I expected at this price range.

I will update this in a few weeks and share my experience with them.",0
4.0,"Great Price, Great Sound!","June 5, 2017",Yes,"These sound great. They stay on well for working out i.e. lifting , running etc. Very comfortable and the battery lasts forever. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they are a little bulky and other people can kind of hear your music when they are around you. I don't know if that is the same with all over ear headphones. However, other then that they are totally worth the money.",1
5.0,Comfortable and sharp.,"April 28, 2018",Yes,"Hey Amazon!! Lol. I never leave reviews. However, I bought these for my boyfriend and they are amazing!! Very pleased like always. Thanks for this product. Going to buy myself a pair tonight.",1

5.0,This is an amazing deal. The headphones sound great,"May 10, 2018",Yes,"This is an amazing deal.  The headphones sound great, hold a charge for a long time, and are comfortable.  The best deal for the price. Sorry Apple, but you can't beat this deal.",0
3.0,UPDATED: Full review including a replacement pair. Testing for bluetooth reliability.,"August 7, 2017",Yes,"*** UPDATE ***.After posting the original review, and spending a couple of weeks sending feedback to the seller a couple of times they sent a new pair of headphones were shipped to me at no cost. It took about 10 days to arrive but I will try them out for a week and see how it goes.  But for now I can raise it from a 1 star to a 3 star review purely based on the customer service. They responded relatively quickly to my emails sent through amazon and that shows a dedication that makes them worth trying. Hopefully it was just a bad pair and everything will work out now..Further update pending. It's always good to know the product quality as well and perhaps more importantly the customer service quality. That is half of what you pay for with anything. Especially the blind purchase process of online shopping...***  ORIGINAL REVIEW ***.Don't waste your money on these. The biggest problem seems to be the internal components on these headphones. The sound quality is adequate but missing a bit of bass in my opinion. They worked for the first 2-3 weeks just fine in bluetooth mode. Then  all of a sudden the bluetooth has become unreliable...I've only used these about 10 - 20 times when working out at the gym. Even when fully charged the headphones now disconnect nowand then they won't stay connected. My phone says they are fully charged but they seem to be turning themselves off. I then have to plug in the headphones jack. Really disappointed because there is no option to return it now after the first month.  Don't risk it. For $30+ this is not acceptable quality.  Bluetooth technology has been around long enough and battery tech has gotten so good that this should not be a problem. I think the internal components on these are just not under very stringent quality controls. I got a reply from the seller but they only want me to troubleshoot the problem which is a hassle via email...The problem is the bluetooth on these just doesn't work after a while. For average sound quality these are a very risky choice if you are reliing on them as bluetooth headsets like I do when I use them for working out at the gym where extra wires are just annoying...On the plus side. They are comfortable, very good at isolating sound and reducing the noise around you. The buttons on the side are not laid out in the most easy way to blindly raise volume and skip tracks.  Without a little ""braille"" style bump on things you find yourself fishing around for the right button to answer calls or adjust volume and often times you hit the wrong one. I could overlook the negatives if they would just be reliable as a bluetooth headset. Also the mic seems to work well. When I did get phone calls there were no complaints on the other end about the sound quality and not being able to hear me. Maybe they'll make a 2nd generation and they'll address the problems. At that point these will be worth the gamble... maybe...*** UPDATE 10/17/17 ***.So within 2-4 weeks the replacement pair's a bluetooth wireless functionality became unreliable as well. I keep it as a 3star rating because when I contacted the seller they were very helpful and allowed me to return them. So the customer service makes these worth a try!  It could be my phone but all of my other bluetooth accessories seem to work just fine. Maye I just got 2 bad pairs.",2
4.0,Works well.,"December 16, 2017",Yes,"The speaker blew in the right ear, but that happens with all my headphones and ear buds so I think it has something to do with me being deaf in that ear. I wouldn’t have noticed had it not been for my child trying them on. Other than that, these are awesome headphones and they stay charged for a long time also.",0
4.0,Great sound and comfortable,"November 6, 2017",Yes,After receiving a replacement by the seller the headphones work great. Great range and no static.,1
5.0,Nice headphones!,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones! My order arrived on time and well packed, thanks. I have been using them daily and they are comfortable and seem well made. They are easy to link with my tablet. I recommend them as a great buy!",0
1.0,Wasted my money,"November 20, 2017",Yes,"I liked these headphones until, after infrequent use, the Bluetooth stopped working.",1
5.0,Sound quality is as good as Bluetooth can be expected,"August 6, 2017",Yes,"This is the 3rd pair of Bluetooth headphones that I've owned, and the construction on them is a lot sturdier than the others that I've come across. Sound quality is as good as Bluetooth can be expected. I've listened to friend's pairs of Bluetooth Beats headphones, and I find no discernable difference in the sound quality between those and these headphones. Wonderful purchase especially considering the price.",0
2.0,Perhaps Defective?,"April 10, 2018",Yes,"I have to admit what I can hear out of one ear sounds wonderful. The right headphone is muffled and anytime I move I can hear a piece of plastic tumbling around in there. The left side is fine, but the right side (where the button controls are) is broken. I probably just got a defective one, but I use headphones eight hours a day for my job and I thought that these would be great. Oh well.",0
5.0,Great deal,"October 23, 2017",Yes,"The sound is good with tv and music and pairs easily with a variety of devices. it's nice to get verbal confirmation of status, rather than having to rely solely on blinking lights and beeps. Very economical.",0
5.0,Three Stars,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"This headset worked perfectly, daily from Christmas until March 19th.  One side stopped playing while listening.  Major bummer.(Three Stars)  Update 4-3-18.  They sent me a new headset when they read this review.  What a great company.  5 Stars!",0
5.0,"Cute, great sound quality, comfortable!","August 20, 2018",Yes,"These are FANTASTIC! I got the pink and am in LOVE. My coworker actually took them off of me to try them on and almost didn't give them back because they were super cute and comfortable. They have great sound quality, I think. The padding feels amazing, and I wear glasses. The padding on top is nice as well. I'm in love!",0
4.0,"Headphones are good, blinking light is not","February 15, 2018",Yes,"I love the headphones, but I'm not happy with the  blinking blue indicator. From what I can see online many headphones have this, and you can't turn it off. So while I'm trying to sleep there's a blinding blinking led light snapping on every 6 seconds. Annoying.",1
4.0,Battery Life is great,"September 23, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphones about 7 months ago and absolutely love them, however now I am having an issue with them. The issue is that I can not charge them no matter what. I have used the usb wire that came with the headphones and other similar wires to it, but they still will not charge. I can use the aux cord that it came with however I did not buy wireless headphones to use a wire with them. Other than this these are a great pair of headphones.",0
5.0,A Must Have Item!!,"June 6, 2018",Yes,You can't beat the quality for the price! Adjustable fit allows these headphones to fit snug and stay put while walking and jogging. Bluetooth quality is awesome! Not the best speaker quality for taking or making calls but not an issue for me as if I have these on I don't plan on talking on the phone.,0
5.0,Perfect for the price.,"October 30, 2017",Yes,"Perfect for the price.  Comfortable, good sound quality.  Easy bluetooth pairing.  The mic isn't great and its weird to talk with sound-isolation muffs on, so I don't recommend it for frequent conferencing.",0
5.0,Very happy with playback,"July 14, 2017",Yes,"They're great! Plenty of bass and they get pretty loud. The passive noise isolation is good, though I don't really have any other over-ear headphones to compare. The price is right too, thinking about getting another pair for home!",1
4.0,"Pretty good, and pretty cheap.","November 21, 2018",Yes,"Has good/okay battery life, I use mine quite a bit and only have to charge them every two-four days, depending on usage. Material is good, no complaints. However as for sound it’s really great when connected via Bluetooth, but using the cord it’s REALLY bad (not a big deal tho cause I bought them for the Bluetooth anyway).",0
3.0,Three Stars,"April 30, 2018",Yes,These work exactly as advertised I just wish that the microphone still worked with the cord plugged in.,1
4.0,button on ear popped off and the cord seems defective as it sound like crackling. I want a refund or exchange,"January 25, 2018",Yes,Customer service will stand behind this product when it fails. The sound is good and feel is comfortable. Use is easy. Calls come through clear.,1

5.0,Good value,"March 23, 2018",Yes,"Works well.. sounds decent. I would be cautious of wearing them to work out though since sweat collects. Not sure how good that is for the headphones, or your ears for that matter.",0
5.0,Great quality for an affordable price!,"June 26, 2018",Yes,I like to use these when I’m doing household chores and they’re amazing! They fit my ears great (and I have pretty big ears!) and the sound quality is awesome. I haven’t even had to charge them yet! Definitely recommend them.,0
5.0,Great headset !!,"January 16, 2018",Yes,"This is a excellent headset!!! My son loves it!! He uses it everyday and it has held up .. I recommend this headset to anyone who has a teenage or just wants a great headset ( only downfall is it has such great sound , that he really can’t hear me now ) lol 😂",0
1.0,Tight and gives headache!,"April 24, 2018",Yes,They are heavy! It's too tight for me and I don't have a big head. They put pressure on the crown of my head and tight on the ears. They give me a headache within a short period of time. Disappointed that there's no free return.,0
5.0,Perfect!!,"October 4, 2018",Yes,Love it! Easily connects to my iPhone Bluetooth. Does have noise cancelling effect due to the perfect fit and quality. Sound is clear and sharp. Fit my 53 year old head perfectly. Don’t mind the pink color at all because my husband won’t wear them.,0
4.0,These headphones are pretty good for the price,"October 21, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are pretty good for the price. The battery lasts for a very long time. Only downside is my ears start to hurt after 4 hours or so. I use them when working so I sometimes don’t notice my ears hurting until I take them off to talk to someone. Afterwards I notice. Anyway, still a good set.",0
1.0,Extremely uncomfortable to wear; sound quality muffled; and microphone doesn't work,"October 24, 2017",Yes,Extremely uncomfortable to wear; sound quality muffled; and microphone doesn't work,1
5.0,The best headphones for the price.,"September 3, 2017",Yes,"I bought this headphones for my nephew an she loved this headphones, he told the sound is great and the battery life is good not great, hey for the price,if you looking for affordable headphones this are the one to buy.",0
5.0,Great product,"January 11, 2018",Yes,This was a gift for my son who is in college and he fell in love with it as soon as he saw it. He sas it is a good product. It is a keeper! It works well and sounds great. I just hope it lasts.,0
3.0,It's only ok for the money.,"February 19, 2018",Yes,Bluetooth quality is only ok.  Crackles a bit and I'm not sure if it's the headphones or the bluetooth device on the other end but in quiet moments on the movies the volume cuts off completely and it's very annoying.  It fades in and out when no one is talking and no background noise.,0
5.0,Good customer service : Good sound quality but too heavy for me,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"Update: after I complained about the weight of the product, they sent me a lighter headphones and it works well. 5 Stars customer service. ***.Good sound quality but too heavy for me.  Please compare weights to other products first if you like to wear it moving/walking around.",0
5.0,Great headphone on a budget.,"March 24, 2018",Yes,"I was a bit skeptical about these at the price point, but I have to say I am very happy.  They are comfortable and appear to be well made.  There is a bit of white noise from the Bluetooth connection, but I think that this is to be expected.  Would by these again.",0
5.0,great headphones,"March 8, 2018",Yes,fantastic headphones for the price. I don't need noise-canceling or anything fancy. These put out great sound and are perfect. Battery life perfectly fine for my usage,0

5.0,Headphones work great. Much better than using wired headphones for things ...,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"Headphones work great. Much better than using wired headphones for things like work or working out. The only issue I've had is that the power button is a bit flimsy and sometimes doesn't register when I go to use it (mostly when I'm trying to turn it off), but that is small potatoes compared to how well they work. They are very comfortable. I've worn them for hours on end and haven't experienced discomfort anywhere near the earbuds I used to use. Sound quality is great too. All the levels seem balanced well.",0
5.0,Great headphones and great price,"July 4, 2018",Yes,"Noise cancelling, these work great for long car rides and two small children (each child has their own pair), I like that they can be wireless or wired.",0
5.0,Great Sound for the price.,"July 22, 2017",Yes,Great sound. Very long battery life. They completely surround my ear cutting off most outside noises.....I've tried several Bluetooth headsets that were cheaper but ended up not lasting very long. These are holding up well with daily use. Exactly what I wanted.,0
5.0,Connects to anything,"September 18, 2018",Yes,These are great I love that it comes with both a jack and usb connectors so you can connect to anything I love the pink color and the quality is awesome 👏🏼,1
4.0,Great quality for a modest price.,"July 15, 2017",Yes,I really like these headphones. They are comfortable. Sound quality is great. The charge lasts a really long time. They paired easily with my phone and I can use the corded jack for the computer. The controls are a little hard to get used to - haven't quite gotten that figured out in the short time I've had them.,0
4.0,There is no way to tell if you turned these ...,"October 24, 2017",Yes,"There is no way to tell if you turned these on or off and they did not come with an instructional booklet, I have googled several times and found a different version but I cannot find the right version so it's a little frustrating.",0
5.0,Comfortable,"October 11, 2018",Yes,I used to wear ear buds all the time which hurt after awhile these may not be the top of the line but sound is comparable too such,1
5.0,Comfort and sound,"October 2, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. They are very comfortable, I don’t like the earbuds much prefer the over the ear headphones",0
2.0,Caused Pain To the Ears,"April 22, 2017",Yes,Bought these headphones for my wife. Unfortunately we had to return it because they where too tight on her ears and they caused a lot of discomfort after an hour of wearing it.,3
5.0,Excellent headphones with Chromebook,"January 13, 2018",Yes,Bought these for my daughter because her earbuds were not loud enough with her Chromebook. She absolutely loves these headphones with her Chromebook for music and videos. Highly recommend.,0
5.0,worth the money!,"November 7, 2018",Yes,I've tried other wireless headphones but this one takes the cake! Affordable and works like magic! I have no complaints yet. Packaging was good. Got them in very good condition. Makes my life easy by moving around while listening to some good music. I would highly recommend this wireless headphones to my family and friends!,0

5.0,Super headphones and service!,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"Sound is good, love the look, but tight on my head and felt very heavy. Had to ask for replacement. Customer service was amazing and fast! They gave me a free replacement and I love my new headphones!",0
5.0,The item is exactly as described,"March 1, 2018",Yes,Perfect!... ive had these for over a week now and only charged them the day I opened the box.... I'm testing how long before they run down sound quality is spectacular with good clear vocals and deep base... the volume is phenomenal if you turn it up to max you're either deaf or about to be,0
5.0,Pretty solid so far &amp; durable + decent sound. 5/5,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"Amazing for far. and the top hasn't broken like similar ones, when work over a baseball cap once in a while. it seems like it would leak sounds but I don't listen to music too loud but when i put it over something I hear no sound even though when put on ear it seems loud enough to leak sound sometimes.",0
5.0,Not for bass,"May 1, 2018",Yes,Have decent sound but bass is minimal...Update: received a new pair and its world apart the difference. Sounds really good and bass is great. Update rating to 5 star.,0
5.0,Super Pleased,"September 5, 2018",Yes,They headphones were exactly what I was looking for. They're true to very claim made in their description. So glad I got them!,0
4.0,Solid Headset for this Price Point,"March 29, 2018",Yes,Sound is satisfactory for a basic Bluetooth headset.  I really like the built in microphone.  Callers cannot tell that I'm speaking through a Bluetooth headset.  Would purchase again.,0
4.0,Great value for the price.,"January 2, 2018",Yes,"My first try at over the ear noise cancelling headphones.  Good sound, keeps outside noise out.  I've done these side by side with my wife's Bose, the Bose are better but not 4 times better.",0
4.0,These headphones sound great to me,"November 21, 2017",Yes,"These headphones sound great to me. They’re not super high quality or anything like that, but for the price they kick out a good sound...Unfortunately, the microphone did not register with my iPad, but customer service was very helpful and replaced the first pair that I got without an issue.

5.0,Very good sound. great construction and comfortable,"December 4, 2017",Yes,"Honestly, for the money these really cant be beat.  Very good sound.  great construction and comfortable.

4.0,Upgrade in tech with good quality at a decent price. Win!,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"A bit bulky, but good sound and easy to operate. I purchased these for my gym workouts and they stay on snuggly during treadmill, biking and strength training. Also manages to drown the gym music which is blared at obscene levels. They aren't noise cancelling, but the padding helps with the sound.",0
5.0,these are suprisingly good. i was a little skeptical,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"these are suprisingly good.  i was a little skeptical.  decent sound, good battery life and actually more comfortable than the sony and beats that we have around the house.",0
5.0,Amazing quality for the price.,"April 24, 2018",Yes,"I have had these headphones for 2 weeks now and I can honestly say it is amazing quality for the price. They are no Bose headphone quality of course, but they have very good regardless. They are also super comfortable and easy to use. I highly recommend these headphones for lounging around, travel, and maybe even the gym.",0
5.0,I love having the ability to link my phone which contains ...,"April 27, 2018",Yes,I love having the ability to link my phone which contains my audio library to the headphones without a wire.  Quality of the sound is good.  The ear pieces cover my ears well which reduces a lot of noise.  I haven't yet tested them on an airplane flight to listen to movies so not sure how much they will cover the airplane noise and allow me to hear a movie without the need of a sound booster.  They are heavier than the wired headphones but not really significant.,0
2.0,This headphone broke after a few months.,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"When I bought this headphone, I started to really love it because this has a feature of connecting to my smartphone wirelessly. However after a few months the headphones all of the sudden just died and I tried everything I could to charge the headphones and turn it back on but it still doesn't work. I am not sure about buying something like this ever again because this can easily be damaged and broken so it doesn't last very long.",0
4.0,Switch them around after an hour. They do get ...,"April 8, 2018",Yes,Switch them around after an hour. They do get tight around the ears.  Sometimes the fast forward button doesn't work. They have lasted longer than my headphones by Nick Cannon,0
5.0,Clear &amp; crisp,"January 4, 2018",Yes,"The music and audio books that i listen to are clear &amp; crisp.  I ordered the black before the pink ones and my boys also liked them and  took the black ones, so I ordered the pink ones in hopes that they would leave mine alone.- they don't mind the pink color they are loud &amp; block out surrounding sounds.",0
5.0,Great Price,"June 26, 2018",Yes,"Great Price, Good Quality",1
4.0,So Far So Good,"May 31, 2017",Yes,So far so good.  I purchased this wireless headphone to watch TV when my wife is in bed.  I use it with my Samsung 4K smart TV. They work great.  I can hear the voices really good.  They are comfortable.  I have a pretty big head (I'm 6' 4') and wear glasses and they fit well.,0
5.0,Best headphones for the price,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"Such headphones for less than 40 bucks deserves 5 stars. Sure, the sound quality could be better, but then, you will have to pay 3 to 4 times the price of this one...The battery duration is really good, and the fact that you can choose between Bluetooth and wired is a feature that I was looking for. No latency, good wireless distance if you're like me and walking around the house with your headphones on and you phone or computer on the other side.",0
4.0,Surprisingly good sound for an inexpensive item,"January 25, 2018",Yes,My 13 year old son bought these.  Surprisingly good sound for an inexpensive item.  I can hear the sound while he is wearing them though.  Not sure how they will be in terms of longevity.,0
5.0,Very pleased.,"October 6, 2018",Yes,"I compared this wireless over the ear headphone with another over the ear headphone that I have which starts with a B. I took 1 star away because the sound was better with the cord, but surpassed the quality of my other B headphone.  I believe I could purchase 3 or more of the Mpow headphone for the same price as my other headphone.",0
5.0,Great style and value,"May 10, 2018",Yes,Very comfortable. Sturdy quality and the sound is pretty good. I have gotten many compliments. I wear at the office to block out noise and occasionally running because they are warm. Handles bass pretty well for a lower priced item.Very happy.,0
5.0,"Comfortable, easy to use, great sound quality and great noice cancelling!","May 23, 2017",Yes,"Very comfortable, easy to use and they have a pretty good range. I use them while on a tractor and the volume of the music doesn't even have to be that loud and I can hear it! Very good at cancelling out the outside noise. Highly Recommend.",0
1.0,I do not recommend this mow headphones it broke a few days after ...,"March 22, 2018",Yes,I do not recommend this mow headphones it broke a few days after return date. Button to control everything broke off now I am stuck with broken headphones. Not happy!!,1
4.0,Good sound but not totally comfortable,"December 16, 2017",Yes,These were nice and had good sound. A little heavy and bulky and a little bit too much pressure on the top of the head where the band went across. But the sound was very clear and good,0
5.0,Great choise,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"I have just purchased this wonderful headphone for my daughter..she like it very much. It's sound is very good. It has light weight and hence she does not feel headache like  does with others..The seller is nice and helpful..Although the delivery was fast, I was worried about receiving the package on time as the delivery status showed me that there were a problem in spite of the fact that I chose fast delivery.  I believe that it IA a problem in the USPS system.",0
4.0,Pretty good but one very small down fall. I would recomend.,"May 7, 2017",Yes,"The product was pretty much how it was explained. It is great and I have had it for several months now. It has a long battery life and works pretty far away. I can probably go 30 feet away and it will function fine. I can also go in other rooms and it will work through the walls. The only thing I didn't like is if I am moving quickly and my phone is in my back pocket, the headphones will cut out sometimes. I would not recommend these headphones for people who want to run with them. I think it only happens when the battery is below 20% but it seems to work 99% of the time. From person to person it seems like this is a good product.",0
5.0,Good sound quality too,"May 28, 2018",Yes,I'm very surprised but these actually have held up quite well and they hold a charge for a very long time. Good sound quality too. Great deal for the price.,0
5.0,Fking amazing probably the best headphones under $200,"August 17, 2018",Yes,"Fking amazing probably the best headphones under $200. Super comfortable, don’t do much cardio but for straight lifting they are great. Battery last forever. Highly recommend!!!!",0
4.0,Good quality for a low price.,"March 23, 2018",Yes,Better than expected considering the price. Pretty comfortable and good volume on bluetooth. I like the ability to switch tracks by touching the buttons on the ear.,0
1.0,Five Stars,"March 18, 2018",Yes,Works great with my iPhone and iMac.  I was surprised with the quality for the price...UPDATE:  A few weeks out and it stopped pairing.  Well try and return.,0
4.0,Better than I expected for the price,"May 13, 2017",Yes,"I purchased these headphones a month ago to replace a pair of in ear headphones that broke and so far I'm happy with them. For the price, they are better than I expected. Sound quality is very good for both music and talk. So far, they work well for phone calls. They are comfortable on your ears but they are a little heavy so while they are good for short periods, they feel cumbersome on your head after a long period. They last long before needing to be charged. It was a little harder to get these to pair with my phone than my previous headphones and if you hold the button on the right hand side to power them off for too long, they'll start attempting to pair again. All minor inconveniences, but at less than $40, I don't expect perfection. They feel durable and I do believe I will get more than a year out of them which is more than I got out of my previous pair. You can't go wrong for the price.",3
5.0,Got these for my little brother for Christmas because they ...,"January 23, 2018",Yes,Got these for my little brother for Christmas because they were cheap and had a long enough battery life that he wouldn’t need to charge all the time. Well he absolutely loves these. Very noise canceling as we have to yell and yell to get his attention. We already bought another pair for when he inevitably breaks these.,0
4.0,For the price...I love em!!,"November 26, 2017",Yes,"They’re comfortable to wear and sound pretty good. If you’re looking for “BEATS” kind of bass, then don’t bother with these. They have a fair amount of bass but they don’t slam your ear drums like beats do. For what I paid for these they sound better than headphones I’ve spent a LOT more money on!",0
4.0,Overall connection flexibility is great,"January 22, 2018",Yes,Comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  The ability to use it with a 3.5mm connection or bluetooth is convenient and makes it easy to use on long flights and not worry about battery life..The only negative is it is tough to work out in as it tends to move around a bit when moving quickly in the gym.,0
5.0,Disconnection issues when streaming video is paused,"February 14, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality is great especially considering the price point. However, just recently they have started to have disconnection issues. While steaming on an iPad if the video is paused the headphones disconnect and need to be reconnected in the Settings app. Really frustrating...Update 4/19/18: Was promptly contacted by customer support and offered a replacement set of headphones. Have been using those for about a month now with no issues so I have updated my review to 5 stars.",0
5.0,"are comfortable, and connect quickly to my phone","March 13, 2018",Yes,"They fit well, are comfortable, and connect quickly to my phone. The only thing is that the volume is kind of quiet compared to ear-buds (makes sense since they aren't in your ears). Would buy again.",0
5.0,"Comfy, Sounds good, Doesn't feel cheap","August 22, 2017",Yes,"Just got it a little while ago, and so far, they seem like wonderful headphones. Comes with a charger and a cable to hook it up to anything that doesn't use Bluetooth, or if you'd just rather use a cord. For their price, they don't feel like cheap plastic headphones, which is very important. They sound wonderful and are comfortable to wear. (have been for the past hour or so) Also, they arent massive headphones, which means they're perfect if you want to wear them in public, as you won't look like a massive dork.",0
5.0,Good sound and great quality construction,"September 8, 2017",Yes,"Totally worth it. Use them when I work at a desk, when I walk to and from the metro stop, and sometimes when I run on an elliptical. Good sound and great quality construction.",1
5.0,"Just what I needed, and for cheap!","December 16, 2017",Yes,"These have been great so far! I've had them for about a month now and haven't needed to charge them yet. Sound is great, and the comfort of the over-ear headphones is just what I needed. I'm amazed that I've paid so much more for a pair of Beats when these work just as well for someone who is a casual user!",0
4.0,so they're great for my 4-year old,"September 2, 2017",Yes,"Not sure if these headphones are volume limiting, but they surely aren't very loud, even with the volume all the way up, so they're great for my 4-year old. But the sound also bleeds out of the headphones, so that's annoying.",0
5.0,Very happy.,"May 15, 2017",Yes,"A very good product. Well made headphones with great sound. Controls have a good quality feeling and are easy to access. Considering the price well worth it. Just ordered a second pair. I have Dish with a Hopper DVR with built in Bluetooth. These headphones paired easily and perfect. Absolutely no latency, clear sound with perfect base. After returning another pair from a different company I was hesitant to try these. I am glad I did. I also received an email from the company asking if I was pleased with how they worked and if not could they help.. That to me is good customer service. Would definitely recommend.",4
5.0,"Good price, light weight, excellent delivery.","January 5, 2018",Yes,A late Christmas gift that was well received.  Very nice fit and light weight good fidelity.  My oldest is very pleased.  I listened to some radio with them and it was very pleasant experience.,0

2.0,I guess not bad for the price,"December 5, 2017",Yes,Moderate sound quality.  I guess not bad for the price?  The blue light blinking on the side is incredibly annoying.  Probably going to have to stop using them at night because of this.,0
5.0,Great buy for the price,"November 24, 2017",Yes,Great buy for the price. I use these when I'm cutting the lawn and although they don't completely block out the tractor noise they due enough as to not require you to turn the volumn up to max. Very satisfied. Exactly what I needed.,0
5.0,Just Order Two,"June 2, 2017",Yes,Great budget headphone that connect very easy to my devices. The sound was clear with great volume control. Unfortunately my husband used them and decided to keep them. It's okay because they are affordable and I can order another for myself.,0
5.0,Great value and quality for the price.,"August 1, 2018",Yes,"Fantastic product for the money.  Used these on a US to Germany business trip and they were great inflight.  These are like a “Beats light” type of product.  Great fidelity for $35.  Solid Bluetooth connection, Rich sound.  Need a 2nd pair.",0
4.0,Pretty Solid headset for the price,"August 3, 2018",Yes,"For the price you get a pretty good wireless headset. multi blutooth is great, function wise great, sound pretty good, not that much low end when you want to bump hard. But everything else is pretty good. esp for the price.",0
5.0,Nice,"April 5, 2017",Yes,Very happy with these headphones.  Good sound and comfortable.  Especially like that you can use them both as wireless and wired. The pads do a reasonably good job of reducing the background noise.  Nice product.  I may buy a second pair as a spare.,0
3.0,Ok,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"Not bad, bass a little too much, but the biggest problem is that they keep wanting to fall off. Not too much squizz I guess",0
4.0,bought these for a plane ride it did well did ...,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"bought these for a plane ride it did well did not eliminate all the jet engine noise but did cut it down quit a bit and music and the movie i watched where a lot more enjoyable then if i had my bluetooth, or corded ear buds in",0

5.0,"3rd pair, love them!","March 28, 2018",Yes,"Well, this is my 3rd pair of these headphones.  I use them with my tablet, phone,  computer.  Mainly for watching videos and whatnot.  Fit great, don't hurt my ears.  They were easy to pair with all my devices.",0

5.0,"Yah, you should probably buy these","January 10, 2018",Yes,"I'm wearing these puppies right now!  Surprisingly great for the price.  I've wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones for ages, but the good ones run about $200.  These are definitely worth it.  I have a small head, and these fit really well and comfortably at the smallest setting (a bit loose, they might fall off if I'm upside-down).  Sound is good, gets surprising loud, but I imagine people around me can hear what I'm hearing too.  Microphone so far is working great, too.  Really easy to set up.",0
5.0,These are great! So versatile,"February 18, 2018",Yes,"These are great! So versatile, convenient, easy to use. Clear nice sound with the option of USB or plug it in.I would recommend these to any of my family and friends.",0
5.0,Birthday gift,"November 7, 2017",Yes,This was a birthday gift for my husband and he really loves them. I used them once to listen to iHeartRadio without disturbing anyone and they are pretty awesome! They block outside noise incredibly well!,0

They are everything I expected and more. I bought my husband and I each a pair with our first order and will be buying each of our kids a set as well.,0
4.0,Excellent sound but one possible fatal flaw,"May 28, 2017",Yes,"Extraordinarily good value...but the headphones suffer from one glaring problem and one potential safety issue...I really like the sound on these--mostly clear and crisp. There's some muddiness in the bass--other reviews mention this--but given the price, I don't expect a pair of Bose. I hear a clear separation of the different tones and I really enjoy the sound...The fit is good, maybe a little tight on my head. The right earpiece presses a bit against my ear and I need to reposition 'em off from time to time. (I may end up finding just the right way to hang them on my head. TIme'll tell.)..I'm not used to the controls, located on the right earpiece. I wish the device had a little bump or ridge or something so I place my finger properly on the volume controls. If I miss, I end up turning the phones off. The headphones are very responsive to Bluetooth connection and they pair and connect easily...Here's my problem: there are voice prompts that announce each action you take. ""Power on."" ""Power off."" ""Your headphones are disconnected."" Etc. Problem is that the voice is loud and that's jarring and unpleasant. I sent an email to the company's customer service department and asked the question on what passes for a support page. Let's see if they respond and if I have any control of the prompts. If not, it's a complete buzzkill and I'll likely return these otherwise excellent headphones...The smaller concern, one that could be a bit of a hazard, is that where the headband separates from the earpieces in order to adjust the size of the headband, the plastic has a fairly sharp edge. Grab the thing just so, or in a hurry, or carelessly, and I believe that one could pick up a nice slice. Which I don't recommend...Well, if these were perfect, I'd give 'em 5 stars. If customer service responds and I can fix it, then I'll add a star.  I'm expecting a response, but if I don't hear back, I'll deduct two more stars...Overall, I heartily recommend these, as long as I can turn off the voice prompts...PS: The red color is just too too much for me.",2
4.0,I love the fact that they also plug in so he ...,"May 7, 2018",Yes,"My son has only had them for a week and loves them. He loves the controls on the headset and the bluetooth capability. I love the fact that they also plug in so he can use them at school with his computer. So far, he said the sound was clear and distinct.",0
4.0,Nice!,"December 4, 2017",Yes,So far so good. We will see how long the charge stays up. I had trouble with my old set losing the charge. They are also a little heavy and pull down on my ears. A bigger head might fix that issuw though!,0

5.0,Stubborn Husband,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my husband. He has so much trouble with his ears (ear infections). I opted for this type instead of earbuds that he was insisting on having. He gave them a shot. Now he looks for things to do just so he can put them on and listen to his music. He loves them!! He said he can hear his music great while mowing and weed eating, whereas it he couldn’t hear much of anything with all the others he’s gone through. They are a great product for a great price!!!",0
5.0,Works great. Connects easily,"March 5, 2018",Yes,Works great.  Connects easily.  Folds for easy storage.  The only downside is they're a little heavy and press down on the top of my head a little but that's a commmon complaint I have about headphones.,0
4.0,They work great my only issue is it is difficult to use ...,"November 11, 2017",Yes,"They work great my only issue is it is difficult to use the volume controls while wearing the headphones....the ""controls"" are smooth and difficult to distinguish up, down, next track...otherwise for the price you really can't bear them",0
5.0,and now I have to say that they sound GREAT. So if you experience something like I described ...,"May 29, 2018",Yes,"When I first tried these out there was some distortion. Processed a return. The next day played music over in home speakers. Same distortion. Comes to find out that a recent Windows updated altered my sound card on my computer .Fixed that problem ( switched my Dolby off), cancelled the return,and now I have to say that they sound GREAT. So if you experience something like I described check your  sound card before returning. I have to say these headphones are a  fantastic buy.",0
5.0,love these! the sound is great,"December 7, 2017",Yes,"love these!  the sound is great, they are comfortable to wear (both band on head and speakers on ear).  Love that they collapse to make them more compact for traveling.  One thing to note, I have a fairly small head, and these do not adjust in size so they may not work for someone who has an especially large head (distance ear-to-ear, over the head)",0
5.0,A great buy.,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"These are great! I bought them for my  flight to Hawaii and they are a great buy. Very comfortable and the sound quality is good. Not super noise canceling, but definitely reduces the outside noise.",0
5.0,Kid friendly,"March 18, 2018",Yes,"We bought these for our 4 year old who has sensory processing disorder because they look very comfortable. He uses these to watch his learning videos on his tablet. They are super soft and fit nicely, he doesn't complain about them being too tight or digging in to the top of his head like most do. I was worried about him breaking them where they fold but they are quite durable. All in all I say they were worth the money cause my kid is happy.",0
5.0,Work great!,"June 19, 2017",Yes,"Great sound, blocks a lot of the outside noise.  I work in a pod-type setup at work and the noise is unbearable at times.  I ordered these to block out the noise.  While they are not electronic, active cancelling, they do block a lot of outside noise.  The sound is good.  The battery life is good.  Ease of use is good.  I consider this to be a recent good purchase!",0
3.0,Bluetooth did not work properly,"November 7, 2017",Yes,"They arrived and looked great and sounded great when plugged into my computer, the problem is with the Bluetooth mode. I have a high end brand new computer that runs windows 10 and  when in Bluetooth mode the headphone sound cuts in and out so badly that you can not even really use it in Bluetooth mode. I sent them back to Amazon and will try one more time just in case I got a bad headphone or a lemon....I was impressed with the sound and the headphones in the plugged in mode though. But I bought them specifically for the Bluetooth feature.",0
2.0,Could be better,"September 18, 2018",Yes,"The product has not lasted up to a year..The junction with the metal and screws have cracked. That's not great. The foam for the ear is also peeling..The engineering should be better..The sound is superb, bluetooth connection is great everything else is just meh.",0
4.0,Two Stars,"November 24, 2017",Yes,Update - They sent me a replacement pair of headphones and these appear to be working properly for 3 weeks now. I'm happy with the functionality of them now...Original - I've had issues with keeping it paired to my laptop.,0

5.0,5 Stars For Performance and Value,"April 24, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones for the price! Paired easily with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Active. I use it to listen to podcasts and music while I'm working around the house; range and sound quality is very good. Adjustable fit is easy and comfortable (and I wear glasses). What pleasantly surprised me was the quality and ease of phone call answering. I have used other BT devices that were always less than ideal on this account. I would recommend them. So, I'm giving them 5 stars for performance and value.",0
5.0,"Great sound, excellent build quality","August 3, 2017",Yes,"Nice sound, they are very confortable, they ear pads completely cover my ears providing great isolation from external sounds. They are a great value, thank you Mpow for offering great quality at very competitive prices.",0

5.0,LONG battery life,"November 7, 2018",Yes,The battery life is soooooooooo long! I think the manual says something like 14 hrs. But with moderate use i think its longer. Ive only charged it twice since i bought it and i had it for 3 months now. The top head band can bother my head after an hour of use and the connection flickers in and out sometimes but for the price this thing is amazing.,0
5.0,No More Cord,"October 17, 2017",Yes,Working great.  Fantastic to be able to waunder away from my tablet and phone and still be able to listen to the audio.  So far so good.  Have used them for a couple weeks now and charged twice.  Everything is as advertised.  Love them.,0

If I wear it for a while, it does tend to get a little sweaty after I've worn them for a while, but this would happen with any over ear headphones. Highly recommend!",0

4.0,Overall great product,"December 3, 2017",Yes,"Great pair of headphones for the price. I’ve only had them for a few days but they do seem durable. However, I wish the entire hinge was metal (the inner part is plastic). It has a nice weigh and feel.",0

Earmuffs are comfortable to wear, just wish a little bit bigger for my ear size. Battery last a long time without charging for a few days. My only negative is the control button on the right side of the headphone.

Highly recommended.",0

I haven't tried with more vigorous exercise..I do like them; fortunately for me, I seldom need to change settings.",0
3.0,"Good sound, poor features","December 4, 2017",Yes,Overall not bad. Hard to recommend as there is an extremely annoying recurring beep that occurs from about 20% battery life down to 0%. It definitely makes the last 1/5 of the battery useless.,1
4.0,Overall: good;  only a couple of minor items,"February 21, 2018",Yes,"I bought these because of the number of reviews and mostly positive feedback...Pros:.The sound quality was very good and they are comfortable to wear...Cons:.The controls are hard to see.  Dark controls on a dark background is not good..They should stand out against the dark background..The USB charging cable could be longer.  It works fine, but it's short (~2 ft)...Overall, this is a fine product.  The cons (above) are not showstoppers.",0
5.0,High quality build,"November 12, 2017",Yes,"Using on TV. Range is about 20 ft (straight line, no obstacles or walls) for best reception. Beyond 20 ft there is a crackling sound and slight distortion. But, for normal TV viewing purpose this is great. Snug fit on ear. I feel a bit of heat generated after about 30 minutes of viewing/hearing but it is probably due to snug fit and not the headphone.",0
5.0,Unbelievable for the money,"March 22, 2018",Yes,"Well I received them in 2 days...which was awesome!.Just set them up today, the sound is great, easy to use, and fit perfectly..As of right now, they are well worth the money, and very happy I bought them.",0

He has used these EVERYDAY since Christmas and they are amazing!  He isn't always gentle with stuff and these are really durable.  He loves them and they really sound great!  I've used them several times and they are really comfortable.  Great headphones!",0
4.0,I love these.,"March 2, 2018",Yes,"Ear pinching occurs occasionally after long use. Sometimes the all-in-one knob can be tricky to use. Also may have trouble picking up the signal once in a while. Otherwise, I love these.",0
4.0,I like it but my ears hurt after a while,"November 17, 2017",Yes,I like it but my ears hurt after a while.  I think the soft foam slowly compresses and then my ears are touching the hard inside speaker part.  Maybe if you have wee little small ears you'll be fine.,0
3.0,Bad design.,"January 22, 2018",Yes,One button on the other side of the head phones controls everything.  It's a pain in the butt to do anything cause it will turn on and off and then up and down.  Bad design.,0
5.0,My husband love these! He needs them for work,"March 6, 2018",Yes,"My husband love these! He needs them for work; they really help you tune out ""the world"" and either concentrate on the music or on what needs to be done.

5.0,Excellent Battery Life and Clear Sound,"March 25, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have great, clear, sound isolation, easy pairing, and are very comfortable. I’ve honestly used them for 10 hours straight and they still did not need to be charged.",0
5.0,The great reviews really are true!,"June 2, 2018",Yes,I wore these today while vacuuming and I couldn’t even hear if the vacuum was on! Saved me hundreds of dollars and way better sound/noise canceling qualifty than Beats. Very happy!,0
5.0,Very long lasting batterylife..,"May 5, 2018",Yes,"It did amaze me for the price and long lasting battery.. I charged it fully and it works for 10 days my normal usage...The material is good and solid, The sound is great for $40 bucks headphone, it probably can beat others in the $80 rangeprice, but dont expect for the highclass bose sound for this price...Overall it exceed my expectation..",0
4.0,perfectly great headphones for the price point,"December 9, 2017",Yes,"perfectly great headphones for the price point. the sound quality isn’t pristine but definitely good enough for my casual listeninh and im fairly picky. they are a little tighter on my head than other headphones but not enough that they were too uncomfortable to wear. great amount of power on them, got them 4+ days ago and have used them constantly without needing to charge. also, i was worried about them being too bulky, but they are much smaller in person and i can even wear them laying down fairly comfortably",0
5.0,"Fits great, battery lasts a long time","June 8, 2018",Yes,"Fits great, battery lasts a long time, somewhat large (which is to be expected) but easy to pack. Never have any issues connecting the Bluetooth so I've never even used the cord for listening. So far I'm loving these!",0

5.0,Gift,"October 16, 2018",Yes,I bought this as a requested gift for my grandson.  I had it shipped to him at his home in another state.  He won't open it until his birthday next month.  I'm sure he will love it.  Thank you.,0
5.0,Great headphones.,"May 23, 2017",Yes,"I'm impressed by the sound quality, listening to Pandora from my phone is crisp and clear.  They fit nicely and cancel most noise. Well made considering the price, and when I get a call I just push the button on the right side, it mutes the music and just talk normally.  Nice.",0
5.0,Surprisingly as good as reviews say.,"January 2, 2018",Yes,"Definitely better than the previous headphones I bought around this price. Cushions are much softer, more color selections, and does isolate outside noise to a muffle. There's some bass to it if you're into that.",0
4.0,... had these for a week but it's been really good. I've only had to charge it once which ...,"July 22, 2017",Yes,"I've only had these for a week but it's been really good. I've only had to charge it once which was the initial charge and I've used it for at least 20 hours this week and I still have half the battery left. The only reason I took off a star is because it doesn't pair seemlessly when transitioning from listening to music to taking a call. Once I answer the call, I have to select the headsets and then they work. The sound quality is excellent and the range is pretty good. Very good for the cost so far and I would recommend to purchase.",0
5.0,Excellent charging time and easy set up,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"So far perfect , excellent charging time last a lot with a single charge still going for 4 days and is easy to set up, I haven't use it yet for phone calls but for listening music thru my apple devices still have to try for phone calls, this is the real deal instead of paying hundreds more for other brand name devices you have a quality and easy to use product with this headphones.",0

2.0,The comfort is not comfortable at all.,"April 9, 2018",Yes,Easy to hook up to blue tooth.  The comfort of the headphones is not comfortable at all.  It is the cost on what you pay for them. I will be exploring other options.,0
4.0,Solid,"June 20, 2017",Yes,It seems like a solid product for the price.  I bought it to use while mowing grass.  The music sounds good and it does a decent job of filtering out the sound of the lawnmower.  The ear openings could be a bit larger.,0
5.0,Just got these today - great!! I saw the high ratings but am ...,"October 18, 2017",Yes,Just got these today - great!!.I saw the high ratings but am a skeptic.I’ve bought a lot of headphones.So I gave it five stars because they are great.For the price these are amazing.Sound is great.UX is excellent.I’m liking them a lot,0

4.0,I use in the gym.,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"Eventhough I lost a part, maybe my fault, maybe not, I still luv these..They work well in the gym as long Im standing or sitting. Any quick movement and they (and this style of headphone) tend to slip outta position.",0

5.0,Great sound for a reasonable price,"February 6, 2018",Yes,Great sound for a reasonable price.  This is my second one I have purchased.  The other set was black and gray.  Will purchase more should I need to.  The black and gray set are still holding up and I purchased them 2 years ago.,0

Painfully loud bursts of static when I moved my head.2. Disconnecting at random.3. Lights changing for no reason completely disconnected from what the user manual days they're supposed to indicate.4. Headset going straight from ""pairing"" to ""power off"" before I could even take my finger off the button.5.",0

The sound quality and comfort was what he loved.  He happy, I happy.",0
5.0,Great Value,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"quality I give them a 4 star, they are very, very good, but not great. But greatness often comes with a price and these don't, so as far as value I give them a 5 star.",0
4.0,Good headphones,"October 30, 2017",Yes,"I would give a five for quality, ease of use, great connections, convenient soft around the ears.

5.0,geat duget headphones its better than moat previous brands ive tried,"November 4, 2017",Yes,love these headphones so much. best thing about it is when i listen to music I don't need to turn up the volume to max or even half way because the speakers in the headphones are just that good ;),0
5.0,I'm actually quite pleased with this set,"May 4, 2017",Yes,"I'm actually quite pleased with this set.  I had tried it with an older bluetooth USB stick, and the sound was horrible.

With the transmitter hooked up to my stereo/tv, I can now watch and listen to TV when I can't sleep at 3:00 AM without waking up the spouse.",0
1.0,don't buy this,"July 18, 2018",Yes,"Music quality is decent, but using this as a headset is terrible. Lots of outside noise gets picked up. Sounded like I was at the royal wedding to the people on the other line. Wouldn't recommend it.",0

They seemed to work fine at first, but 2 months later, they could no longer connect through blue tooth..^^^.This was my original review of the product. I have to say I was surprised when the company immediately emailed me with their apologies and automatically send me a new pair of headphones. I got the new pair a week after they contacted me. So far they are working great. Excellent customer service in my opinion.",0

5.0,Good for asking price,"August 2, 2017",Yes,"It's high quality item for asking price, a little heavy but I think it's still portable and powerful enough. The ear cover  is not breathable that's why your ears might get sweat after 30 minutes but this is how it eliminate extra noises. I like it. Very much so far",0
4.0,I absolutely love it.,"September 21, 2017",Yes,I absolutely love it... Unfortunately the track skipping buttons did not work and since I did not want to send it in for a new one they gave me a three dollar refund... Now if it had come working properly I would have easily giving it a five out of five.,0
3.0,"Great sound, not noise canceling","February 24, 2018",Yes,These headphones have great sound.  I gave 3 stars because they are not sound cancelling.  You can hear everything else in the room.  They ARE also heavy.,0
4.0,Honestly these aren't quite as good as the qc25s,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"I have a pair of qc25's. I thought about upgrading to the 35's so I could be wireless, but I couldn't stomach the price. Honestly these aren't quite as good as the qc25s. The noise cancelling on the 25's is nice, but on these the noise cancelling is noticeable when you're not listening to anything. On the qc25, if I'm not playing music, the noise cancelling isn't noticeable.",0
5.0,Good cost to value,"November 3, 2017",Yes,I received them very quickly and they are good quality for the price. It's a bit tricky to get the power off/on timing just right in the bitten. But not enough to affect the performance or usage.,0
5.0,Husband loves these!!,"January 17, 2018",Yes,Got these for my husband and he says they are great! He's had them for about 6 months now and still uses them daily for work. He loved the foldable feature so they fit nicely in his bag.,0
5.0,Great product for reasonable price.,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"Just received these. Not sure on the battery life he, but they are a gift for my daughter and she LOVES them",0
5.0,great sound and comfort!,"August 29, 2017",Yes,"Got it for 13 yr. old daughter, she told me the sound is very good and it is super comfortable!  Kids this age could be very critical, but she loves it.  i thought the price is quite good as well. let's hope it lass longer than her other headphones/ ear buds.",0
5.0,Punches above it’s weight,"September 27, 2018",Yes,"All I wanted was some passable over the ear Bluetooth headphones for airline travel. These things are much better than the price may lead you to believe. They’re not earth shattering in quality or performance, but they are much better on both fronts than what I paid for",0
5.0,Best headphones for the price,"July 23, 2018",Yes,I love these wireless headphones got for niece wo we wouldn't hear her playing her games they have great range and sound good for price I have three pairs will probably order two more pair,0
5.0,"Awesome Sound, Best Buy!!!","April 24, 2018",Yes,Amazing Sound!!!! 10 stars if I was able to leave that rating.... worth every Penney... why buy expensive brand when you have these guys :),0
5.0,Very happy with this product,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"Very happy with this product.  Although it is not sound cancelling, which I knew, it does muffle outside sound enough to enjoy what I am hearing on the headset.  Love this item!!",0
4.0,Very happy with purchase,"August 5, 2017",Yes,I really like the build quality  of the headphones.  Sound is surprisingly good as well.  I synced easily with my Bose via bluetooth.  I haven't tested the range yet but so far it works very well.  I am very surprised of the sound and build quality due to the price.  I was a bit skeptical at first.  They are very comfortable while worn as well.  I will come back after I test with my iPhone and the talk capabilities.,0
5.0,Good bang for your buck.,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"Very comfortable ear cushion material. I’d go so far as to say ‘luxurious feeling.’ Smart, sharp look. Bluetooth works well. Very nice overall tone for the cost, solid low end.",0
4.0,Great for occasional use,"October 21, 2017",Yes,"For the price, it’s perfect for occasional use.  I don’t think they are comfortable enough to wear for a long time.  After an 8 hr flight, my earlobes were getting tender from the pressure of the headphones. Other than that they are perfect",0
4.0,"Really like these especially, for the money.","July 11, 2018",Yes,They meet my needs as I wear them on the bus to and from work each day. Enough noise reduction that I don't hear conversations but still am aware of my surroundings. They were easy to pair with my Samsung Galaxy 8plus phone.,0
4.0,Good but not comformatle on ears.,"January 14, 2018",Yes,Its a good purchase with this price. The sound is clear with the beats. The only issue I found that I cannot have it on my ears for long. These are not so much comfortable.,0
4.0,Great product! ONE BIG CON though.,"November 30, 2018",Yes,Perfect on every level and far better product vs. competiton due to price..BUT YOU CAN NOT MUTE THE MIC IN A CALL ON THE HEADSET!..You must press mute on whatever device it's linked to. This is a real problem for conference calls.,0
5.0,Sounds great.,"April 25, 2017",Yes,"Sounds great. However, for an older individual, I hoped for a slightly easier pairing process. Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this product..Your follow-up email did the trick. I am now easily paired. 4 stars raised to 5 stars!",0
3.0,"CAREFUL! fakespot.com gives this one a ""D"" and a real grade of 2.5 which is much closer to reality.","February 12, 2018",Yes,It's an ok set. Very aesthetically pleasing and comfy but sound quality wise is exactly what you would expect a 30$ set to be like. Too bad so many reviews here are either click farm of bot-generated,0
5.0,Great headset,"November 8, 2017",Yes,I do allot of commercial flying for work and I love how i can use bluetooth or wired for plugging into the aircraft jack. They sound great and fold nicely into my laptop bag. Already purchased another for my wife.,0
5.0,"So far I got this product it's been great, I use it basically for the gym","March 11, 2018",Yes,"So far I got this product it's been  great, I use it basically for the gym.

5.0,These headphones are very comfortable. I purchased them to use when working out,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are very comfortable. I purchased them to use when working out, so I can listen to music or watch a show while on the treadmill and not have to worry about the wires coming loose or knocking down my phone. They have held up great so far and even withstand sweat from a workout!",0
4.0,"Very comfortable, and average sound quality.","March 18, 2018",Yes,"They are very comfortable and for the price they are great. I was hoping for richer bass than they provide and depending on what you are listening to the sound is a bit tinny. However, I do listen to a lot of punk, and indie folk which usually isn't produced in the best sound studios. Again, for the price you pay these are a great pair of headphones. Can't see myself spending the money for the several hundred dollars brands out there.",0
5.0,Impressive!!,"January 18, 2018",Yes,"I was really impressed with these headphones in terms of the build quality and nice sound. These headphones also came with a USB charging cable, auxiliary audio cable, and a pouch bag-not bad at all for the price I paid. My co-worker introduced these headphones to me and now over 80% of my office purchased these headphones. Cool!!",0
4.0,I don't like ear buds so got this,"January 6, 2018",Yes,"I don't like ear buds so got this. Sound is clear and pairs easily, however it doesn't always read your ""presses"" so I sometimes have to press several times before the headset turns off, etc. (Have to hold button for 5 seconds.)",0
2.0,They heat up under 30 minutes,"January 5, 2018",Yes,"I wanted to send them back but forgot to do so. As I use them to game or watch a movie, they heat up easily in less than 30 minutes and I HAVE to take them off. Mind you, that I'm in air conditioning. When the temperature is hot outside these are no good to use. Something to consider if you live in warmer climates.",0
4.0,good sound. controls easy to work,"July 4, 2018",Yes,good sound. controls easy to work. Using the phone feature was easy and hearing was clear and loud. Enjoy it. Would buy again,0
4.0,Not bad for the price,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"Very, very well insulated. Like, way too well insulated. My ears get sweaty after like ten minutes, nevermind hours...Still, they're comfortable and the sound quality seems fine, especially for something as cheap as this. Can't complain much.",0
5.0,Great sound quality for the very affordable price,"June 5, 2018",Yes,"Great sound quality for the very affordable price. Recently I had these fail on me and I decided to contact the seller. Within the day, I got a response and now have the replacement on hand. By far one of the best customer service experiences that I've had.",0
4.0,My husband can hear tv w/o turning it to blasting,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"Arrived promptly, good quality, and haven't had it long enough to know what the battery life is.",0
4.0,"Good sound, great features","September 7, 2017",Yes,"Had some trouble pairing it but that was apparently due to plugging the MPOW bluetooth receiver into a USB hub instead of directly into my laptop. Sound is decent. It blocks out a lot of noise which is a little bit of a downside for me. I would have appreciated the ability to replace the ear cushions with velour pads that would open it up a bit more than faux-leather, but it doesn't seem that they are removable.",0
5.0,THESE HEADPHONES ARE THE BOMB.COM,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"I have a conch piercing and it is usually sore after listening to music with over the ear headphones. These cover my piercing completely so I can listen to music for hours!! Super mega comfortable and it feels like a teddy bear is hugging my head. I love these, definitely worth the money.",0

5.0,these headphones are awesome! I bought Beats for years,"March 18, 2018",Yes,"Seriously, these headphones are awesome! I bought Beats for years...never again. Sound quality is great. Handles the low end sounds better than I expected. The battery lasts for ever. I use it ever night and I have only charged it twice since I bought it. No problem connecting to all my devices, even my Firestick TV, which my Beats could never figure out.",0
5.0,... friend who has some hearing impairment so he can enjoy music more fully,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"I bought this for a friend who has some hearing impairment so he can enjoy music more fully.  He hears best when the other sounds are shut out, and this does that for him.  Thank you!",0

4.0,Great but tricky to turn them off,"December 20, 2017",Yes,Great sounding headsets.  I use them to watch TV while my husband sleeps.  My only complaint is that it's hard to turn them off and the battery life isn't as long as I would like,0

5.0,Love them and great battery life.,"January 28, 2018",Yes,"The charge lasts such a long time. I have only charged it a total of 3 times because I always turn it off when I’m not using them. However, I do use them quite often so I am amazed at how long it lasts. The sound is really good for the price. The only con for me is that my ears get sore after wearing them for awhile  but I think it is because I have small ears.",0
4.0,Great for air travel.,"January 25, 2018",Yes,I mostly use these for long plane trips to watch movies on the seat back monitor. They do a pretty good of blocking out noise and the sound quality is decent.,0
5.0,Great pair of bluetooth headphones,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"Great pair of bluetooth headphones. The pairing was easy and the sound is great..While they dont cancel out ALL noise just on their own, they cancel out good enough when you have your music playing. They fold up to store away easily in their cloth bag..Charging is easy and they last forever while on battery power. Highly recommend.",0
5.0,These work good sound is good and it pairs up with bluetooth ...,"February 28, 2018",Yes,These work good sound is good and it pairs up with bluetooth devices quicker than sound its self.  Seriously never had a device that pairs so quickly.,0

5.0,Great Headphones!,"August 25, 2017",Yes,"I bought these headphones for my 14-year-old son and he loves them. Easy bluetooth pairing, comfortable, easy access controls, and they fold up to carry around when not in use. I would definitely recommend them.",0
3.0,"Sound good, mic not so good.","January 20, 2018",Yes,"I'm a truck driver and thought these would be ok for watching movies and making phone calls while I'm in the sleeper. Well the movie watching is fine with great sound quality. But, the phone calls have anyone I'm speaking to complaining of a bad echo and or distant voice. I'm not sure if I'll return them yet.",0
4.0,Love 'em!,"July 26, 2017",Yes,"Loved the headphones, but the reception is heavy on the bass side. I will check my PC for settings..Update: Adjusted PC settings and now everything is great. I am using these on my PC with a cable.",0

I went as far as being issued another set from Apple.  I bought these headphones and so far to my amazement, they have been wonderful.  Sometimes more is not always better!  Great product with a fantastic price. 5 stars!!",0
5.0,These are the BEST headphones I've EVER had (I've had tons),"April 8, 2018",Yes,"These are the BEST headphones I've EVER had (I've had tons)!! The cord is made so well that, so far, it has not broken. It has only been a little over 1 month since I bought them, but the cord shows no signs of weakening. Each of the many, many headphones I've previously owned would have already begun to show signs of wear and tear on the area of the cord nearest the plug insertion. The bluetooth works well, also.",0
5.0,These work great! My daughter loves them,"December 24, 2017",Yes,These work great! My daughter loves them; the sound quality is as good as much more expensive sets and the bluetooth works two rooms away from her phone. Great gift!,0
3.0,More looks than sound.,"October 12, 2017",Yes,"Fast shipping and easy transaction but as far as the audio quality is concerned, these leave a lot to be desired..Build quality is decent and they are packed with audio control features and Bluetooth connectivity, but at the end of the day, these still sound like $5 headphones.",0
1.0,Great at first but wont charge,"February 1, 2018",Yes,"The headphones were great sounding and the battery lasted forever! But once it finally died, I cannot charge them back up. I plug them into the provided cable but no lights or anything. I left it on the charger overnight but it still wouldnt turn on again. I knew these headphones were too good to be true.",0
5.0,Sweet,"November 22, 2017",Yes,"These wear/use these every day. I work construction and am around loud saws, equipment, and people. They fit right on my hard hat and stay up there too. If I wanna rock out or just ignore people. These are perfect.",0

Disqualified within moments of opening the package. Too bad, these look cool and feel nice. Maybe decent just for listening to music, but even that is quite a bit muffled and low fidelity.",0
3.0,"Don't go walking, must remain still.","June 16, 2017",Yes,"I like these to wear on the plane or at the office.  But you can't walk with them. Every step you take you hear a loud thump.

5.0,Great,"October 25, 2017",Yes,These work great. Connected immediately to my devised and sound great.  Only complaint is that the manufacture should hire someone who acually speaks English to write the manual.,0
3.0,"Good sound, but after several hours of use my ...","June 3, 2017",Yes,"Good sound, but after several hours of use my ears get a bit sore from how tight these headphones fit.There's no way to adjust the tension either.

5.0,Love these headphones!!!,"March 28, 2018",Yes,"I bought these headphones for my 6 1/2 year old autistic son, since we have had these I have only had to charge them once. They are super comfy and are noise canceling, I have tried them myself and fell in love with them. He had a pair that the charge only lasted for 1 hour and we cannot use the headphone port on our iPad due to a faulty headphone cord from Five Below and the jack breaking off inside the port. He loves them for our iPad to play his games and to watch videos.",0

1.0,Stopped working after 2 months,"September 6, 2017",Yes,"Just received these today and honestly expected better, even at $33. The sound quality is not good. The highs are very static sounding. There isn't much bass either and even at the highest volume setting they do not get loud. I was optimistic after reading what seemed like many legit reviews, but these are a let down...Update: Someone reached out offering to replace these with another pair. The second gen version of these is unavailable, so they sent the MPOW H2 with equalizer. I can say the sound quality and overall performance is much better. It's what I originally expected. Seller earns back a couple of stars for good customer service...Update: After 2 months of very light use, the replacement headset has stopped working. They won’t take a charge at all. I don’t recommend that anyone waste money on this product regardless of how good the seller’s customer service is. I will be spending on a quality pair of name brand headphones after this experience. You get what you pay for. In this case... a headache and headphones that don’t work.",9

They fit over my ears nicely, the sound was excellent, and they were comfortable.

5.0,Mpow Bluetooth headphones,"September 21, 2017",Yes,"I wasn't sure how these would be to connect to everything, especially my TV.  They work so well, great sound. So super easy to connect. Glad I don't need the cord, as it's pretty short.",0

5.0,Get a Great Bluetooth Signal even from a distance,"March 16, 2018",Yes,I can enjoy movies and music for hours before charging again and I'm really surprised at the distance the Bluetooth has. I can walk to the opposite side of the house and still have a great audio signal.,0
5.0,great quality headphones,"August 1, 2017",Yes,"great quality headphones, wasnt sure i was going to buy it but i totally love it! they are slick looking and nice on the ears. very comfortable and doesnt get too loud. i have only had it for 2 weeks and so far it works great! i have a small head so it is a tad big but overall it is a great product!",0

5.0,Recommend,"September 7, 2017",Yes,Great headphones for the price.  They get the job done and auto connect to my phone as soon as they turn them on..Would recommend to a friend.  They don't have the bass like Bose or Beats but they are also only $30...,0
3.0,Save your money,"May 19, 2018",Yes,"I’m not sure why everyone bushes over these headphones.....decent quality but they fail to block out any background sound. headphones also failed to keep the music noise contained.....my coworkers could hear ALL the sounds when the volume was only at an 12/100..Good quality for comfort and ease of use, but overall not impressed",0
1.0,Battery is garbage,"October 17, 2018",Yes,"I’ve had two pairs of these. The first pair I had for less than 6 months, and they won’t stay connected. So I bought another pair. The second pair was going strong, and now they won’t hold charge. I charge them till the light goes off, but the life doesn’t last even an hour. I’ve had these for a little over 3 months. I’m so disappointed.",0
5.0,perfect,"September 5, 2018",Yes,"I got three of these for my kids to use in school.  They love not being tangled up in chords.  They paired great with devices, and have been easy for my kids to use.",0
5.0,"High quality, great battery life, definitely reccomend","December 4, 2018",Yes,"These headphones work great! Really long battery life that feels like it lasts 2 days (with how often I use them at least) and really glossy tough plastic with a small bit of foam at the bottom of the support bridge between the two sides. Very durable and has lasted a month or so at the time of writing this review. Gets sore if you wear it on one ear, but it's fine if you just switch ears.",0
4.0,Great value for the money,"July 3, 2018",Yes,Great value for the money. If your are looking for big bass these are not the headphones for you. Sound quality is good for the price.,0
4.0,Sound great. Low Bass. Others can hear what you're listening to,"February 26, 2018",Yes,They work well sound great. Not a lot of bass. Don't like that others can hear what you're listening to. They are sort of noise cancelling. Not as well as Sony or Beats.,0

5.0,The Mpow Headset looks pretty flashy on first sight,"August 23, 2017",Yes,"I like that MPow gives you that choice of color. My first set had a few issues, but then the manufacturer sent me a new one where everything worked perfectly including the Microphone.",1
5.0,So far these work just fine. I use them for listening to TV,"April 1, 2017",Yes,"So far these work just fine. I use them for listening to TV. The band on the top of the head is padded but I wish I could make it a little longer so it didn't press down. Otherwise, I am very happy with the price and the quality. The controls are handy and easy to use.",0
5.0,Noise cancelling works great!,"February 15, 2018",Yes,"Just purchased for noisy office area. Already, 2 people stood in front of my desk having a conversation and I - heard none of it.  Only my music.  The only thing I have found so far is that I can't pause my music if it's not on Bluetooth, but that is such a minor issue to me, I don't even knock the product for that.",0
5.0,Loved!,"March 31, 2018",Yes,I purchased one set for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. Before giving them to him I had my teenage son test them to make sure they worked as expected. He was so impressed with them that I ended up ordering one for my son. Once I listened to them and played with the phone capabilities I ordered a set for myself! A total of 3 sets were purchased and everyone LOVES them.,0
5.0,"Kids like them, and they seem to work well","January 3, 2018",Yes,"Kids like them, and they seem to work well. I can keep their phones charging at the top of the stairs, and they can still hear their music playing in their downstairs rooms.",0

5.0,Awesome product! Love the color.,"August 23, 2018",Yes,"I don’t use them everyday, but so far so good. They are easy to pair. I like that I can change songs using the headphones and not my phone.

5.0,These headphones are better than I expected,"April 1, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are better than I expected. I use them, when I walk. The quality of sound is excellent. Callers on the other end of my calls say they hear no outside noise. Love them!!!",0

4.0,so good. They work as promised and feel good,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"So far, so good. They work as promised and feel good. I would give them 5 stars, however, I am still testing their ability to hold a charge, but that doesn't appear to be a huge issue.

5.0,The sound is good for a product in this price range and the ...,"March 12, 2018",Yes,I bought this headset to help reduce outside noise and to provide music while I was on the treadmill. The Bluetooth syncing process worked well on the several individual devices I tried with it. The sound is good for a product in this price range and the over the ear fit provides all of the outside noise suppression I was looking for. I would recommend this to anyone looking for similar functionality.,0
5.0,Ear pain Update,"February 14, 2018",Yes,Ears hurt after an hour of use. Pain is not from the volume but from the discomfort on the ears...Update: I was given a replacement headphones to try to solve the ear pain and the new ones are much more comfortable and lighter. Great customer service. Mpow does not want you to be unsatisfied!,0
5.0,Good for working out,"July 27, 2017",Yes,I bought this to sprint and lift weights with because I was tired of accidentally ripping out the cords. This does the job! Good noise output and easy hookup to my phone,1

They work great. I  recharge them overnight and they work all day long.(as long as I make sure the charger is plugged into the power strip),0
5.0,Perfect,"October 13, 2017",Yes,"They are just what I was looking for and they fit my head, which is usually an issue because I have a small head. They do cancel out most of the noise in the background as well.",0
5.0,Great buy! These are awesome headphones!,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my husband and he loves them. He says that they are super comfortable, sound quality is great. He loves how snugly it fits OVER the ears and not on them. They come with the option for a corded connection or wireless one, and a nice bag to store them in. They are very sturdy feeling and they look expensive. I’m definitely buying myself a pair right after this post!",0
4.0,fun toy,"August 20, 2017",Yes,"tight fit, somewhat comfy, a tad sweaty, but great sound. The controls are a bother to operate when on your head.. gotta take  em off to lower vol for commercials etc.. but for music they are great. nice toy.",0
2.0,A little hot. A little lame.,"November 25, 2017",Yes,A little hot. A little lame...They look great! However the sound quality is pretty sub par. Apple stock earphones are better honestly. Bass is almost non existent. After about 10 seconds your ears get a bit hot too. The good news is they are soft on your head and will fit people with large domes.,0

5.0,"Great value, great sound","July 22, 2017",Yes,"So far so good.  Fits over the ears as listed, only used to listen to audio books and podcasts and sound is great. Passive noise cancelling works well. Recommend to those who don't care about name prestige.",0
4.0,"works great, easy to set up....","January 1, 2018",Yes,"Lightweight, stylish...colorful.. and it works... easy to set up..useful as a link in a noisy work shop to the phone, and background music.. worthwhile purchase...",0
1.0,They cover the ear and have good sound.,"March 7, 2018",Yes,"I wear these at work. They're ok, but can start hurting my ears. They cover the ear and have good sound...5/21 UPDATE : These have now started to fade in and out, and the vocals are barely audible.",0
5.0,Five stars,"July 31, 2018",Yes,"I have had these for two months now and I workout on average 3 times a week with these and I haven't had to charge them yet. The battery life on these is insane. Also they are sweat proof and they stay on even when doing sprints. The sound quality is also good, but I'm not too picky about that.",0
5.0,The headphones worked good as far as pairing only once or twice,"January 17, 2018",Yes,"The headphones worked good as far as pairing only once or twice, then failed miserably. I have  been able to pair with my ipad's Bluetooth.only one or two times. Very disappointed that I have to use a wire connection to use them.  Received new headphones from the company in a week and successfully paired them without any problems.  Thanks for the prompt service, your awesome!",0
4.0,Solid++,"August 17, 2017",Yes,"They're great! Not any sound leakage in comparison to my old pair. I don't love the placement of the buttons or that it takes a good 5 seconds holding down the button to turn it off, but they're still great.",0
4.0,Best item for price,"December 18, 2017",Yes,"For price it’s an amazing product. But wish they made an extra button instead of on/off/play/pause all on the same button. Other than that, it’s soft and comfortable.",0
5.0,Good comfortable headphones for a good price.,"January 23, 2018",Yes,Great headphones for the price. Very comfortable and good sound. Bluetooth works perfect with good range. If you are looking for a decent pair of headphones buy them you will not be sorry.,0
5.0,Nice quality for price,"December 25, 2017",Yes,My 10- yr son got these for Christmas and opened them on Christmas Eve. He seems to really like them so far. He thinks they are one of those expensive pairs of headphones like Beats.  I won't disappoint him! Ha Ha Shhhhh.....,0
5.0,Very please with this headphone,"November 24, 2018",Yes,This is my first headphone fo this type.  I'm in my 7th decade and couldn't be happier with this product.  Love the pink color I chose.,0

4.0,BUT they were perfect for my flight from NJ to CO,"July 17, 2018",Yes,"Was worried with the price that these headphones wouldn't get the job done, BUT they were perfect for my flight from NJ to CO!! They are the first headphones not to hurt my ears after hours of wear. I would give them 5 stars, I don't love the power button and that keeps me from rating the 5 stars but 4.6 would be more accurate.",0
5.0,They did a great job blocking the noise,"May 2, 2018",Yes,We bought these headphones to use on long plane rides.  They did a great job blocking the noise.  They are a little bigger than we wanted but are not uncomfortable.,0

5.0,Sound quality is amazing. I mostly use it for audiobooks and use ...,"July 14, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality is amazing. I mostly use it for audiobooks and use a dual bluetooth audio transmitter so i can watch  movies with the significant other who also has one. cuts out background noise really well. I have also played games with it connected to the pc. works well also, however with the mic and sound enabled the audio turns to trash. do not use this as a pc game sound AND mic. otherwise i have no complaints.",0
5.0,Fantastic for what you pay for!,"October 21, 2017",Yes,These are phenomenal for what you pay! Not too bassy and not to high pitched on the treble. I've worn these for hours with glasses on watching movies and never got uncomfortable and never needed charging throughout a plane ride to the UK with 3 hour layover. It paired with everything I have including newer devices. Only thing I didn't like was the case so I used an old crown royal bag that I can also keep the charger in.,0
5.0,Quality sound,"August 29, 2018",Yes,"I have had these for a few months.  Love the sound,  easy phone hook up. Only charged one since I bought them and i use them for about 10-15 minutes when in use..",0

4.0,Looks good and stylish but it was a little too tight ...,"April 20, 2018",Yes,"Looks good and stylish but it was a little too tight on my head. That is not why I only gave it 4 stars though. The sound was extremely bassy drowning out the other frequencies. If you like mostly bass, then you cant beat this price. If you enjoy some mids and highs then this wouldn't suit you.",0
3.0,The sound quality is great and the construction is good,"March 21, 2018",Yes,The sound quality is great and the construction is good. They are really uncomfortable though. They make the top of my head sore and ears hurt within 20-30 minutes.,0
5.0,I love it when a plan comes together!,"November 6, 2017",Yes,I bought this for my husband and he is using them right now. They pair well with the device that I bought to make his non wireless tv wireless. I love it when a plan comes together.,0
5.0,good looking and works great.,"October 19, 2018",Yes,used as a set of bluetooth earphones for an mp3 player. they are easy to use and sound great.,0
5.0,I Am Amazed!,"December 4, 2017",Yes,These Bluetooth Headphones come in great!  I paid a lot for Sony....but these come in almost as good. They last for a long time once you charge them. A very good buy:),0
5.0,An absolute banger for under $50!,"February 13, 2018",Yes,"After a couple months of use, I wanted to come back and say these are undoubtedly the best headphones you can buy for under $50. Great quality, both sound and build, and very comfortable. I would recommend these to literally everyone. Don't let the low price, or the brand (although relatively unknown, but great products) steer you away! These are quality.",0
3.0,Sound quality is just ok.,"February 9, 2018",Yes,Looking at the reviews I thought these were what I was looking for.  These work as described but they don't sound too good. Bass is barely there and treble is on the high side. These would be good for kids. I will be giving these away to my nephew.,0
4.0,Good sound but fit a bit tight for me,"October 25, 2018",Yes,Great sound quality for the price. They fit a bit tight for me and after an hour or so of listening my ears hurt.,0
4.0,They are comfortable to wear and the sound is good,"November 18, 2017",Yes,So far these work very well. They connect properly every time I turn them on. I've used them off and on for several days without recharging them. They are comfortable to wear and the sound is good. Overall tone of the music is a bit deeper than I expected but for me that is not a problem.,0
5.0,Pairs with Firestick,"November 15, 2018",Yes,It pairs with FIRESTICK!!!!! Best headphones ever... no need for to pay for the  extra transmitter for non smart tv!,2
4.0,I love these headphones,"August 7, 2017",Yes,"I love these headphones. They sound great , hold a charge for 8-10 hours , and are simple to use. They do occasionally get a little uncomfortable (especially on hot days) but overall they are wonderful.",0
5.0,Perfect so far!,"December 5, 2018",Yes,These are honestly worth the money and work great for the short amount of time I’ve had them. Will update if anything comes up,0
5.0,"Good Product, Really Good Price","December 27, 2017",Yes,"These headphones work fantastic. I had some on the ear Beats that cost drastically more an have fallen apart/stopped working on one side.  I've only had these for about 6 months, but they are very comfortable.  I use them at work from time to time to make phone calls, as well as at the gym. I haven't had an issue yet. I highly recommend these in lieu of a more expensive product...Note - not noise cancelling but drown out enough noise for my needs on flights.",0
5.0,Money well spent,"July 11, 2017",Yes,"MY PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED!!!!! I purchased these headphones because of the great rewviews. I have been searching for headphones with a great bass and sound. I use headphones mainly to workout, and the last 3 years have been atrocious with the number of headphones I have gone through. I finally decided that headphones with cords were just not for me. Being the cheapstake that I am, I refused to buy pricey name brand ones. Even these wer a little ""out of my league"" but I figured that after all of the money I have spent on trying to find the perfect pair, I might as well give these a try. And am I so glad I did! I've had them for a week and I absolutely love them. The sounds is exactly what I've been looking for (super loud so that I can't hear the grunters at my gym) but protective enough to where my ears don't feel violated. Money well spent if you ask me.",3
4.0,They don’t cancel much noise,"December 15, 2017",Yes,They don’t cancel much noise which is kinda disappointing. Maybe i just have really loud roommates? Other than that they are fine for the price. You’re gonna have to spend a little more for super high quality headphones.,0
3.0,Three Stars,"August 10, 2017",Yes,"uncomfortable after a few minutes, pressure around ears.  do these loosen up after several uses?",1
4.0,So far so good. I have only had it for a week ...,"August 5, 2017",Yes,"So far so good. I have only had it for a week but it is working exactly as expected. It is 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the volume went a little higher. But overall, I definitely recommend!",0
4.0,Love these!,"February 3, 2018",Yes,"Bought a pair for my niece for Christmas, so obviously I had to try them out before giving them. Just had to make sure they worked well ;) I ended up loving them and bought a second pair for myself. Shortly thereafter I ended up in the hospital for a week and they were doing construction above my room. These helped drown out the noise so I could actually rest. Love these!",0
4.0,Good but watch out for size.,"November 9, 2017",Yes,"This is my first head phones that I bought for use with my phone. It was smaller than expected, but i do have a big head. My brother, who has a smaller head, wears them comfortably for extended periods and seems to have no problem with them. These give out good sound quality and is good for every day use. Just beware if your'e on the big head side like me, because these will not fit you comfortably.",0
1.0,I would not recommend this product,"March 20, 2018",Yes,"First time using these headphones and the right side keeps cutting out. I'm not even using them wirelessly. I have to tap on the right side to get it the sound to come back. As a transcriptionist, this is very frustrating to me because I have to stop and play with my NEW headphones until the sound comes back in that side. I would not recommend this product, nor buy it again.",0
5.0,Good quality,"May 8, 2018",Yes,Comfortable with good sound.  They pair fairly easily and have a decent battery life.  I feel it is a great purchase for the price.,0
5.0,Simply awesome for the price,"March 11, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are simply awesome for the price! The bass isn't the same quality as Beats, BUT for $35 these headphones fit very comfortably and don't slip off, at least for gym activities. The Bluetooth function works well and the 33ft distance I haven't entirely tested but I have walked away for a considerable distance and had no skipping of any sort. Highly recommend these if your looking.",0
5.0,Sounds great. Does what it says. Better that Beats!,"December 31, 2017",Yes,Sounds great.  Does what it says.  Bought for my fiance after his beats by Dre were stolen.  He liked these way more!! Got myself a pink pair.  Had them for like 5 months and have charged them only 3 times!,0
5.0,Easy to set up,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"Works well, easy to use and set up. Comfortable fit over ears and good with drowning out background noise interference.",0
4.0,Decent Headset,"August 7, 2018",Yes,"Works fine for music on a phone or computer. But if you are playing a game on your TV and are using a Bluetooth transmitter the sound goes in and out, which is a little annoying. I also wish there was a way to use the mic when on the computer. If there is a way that can be done that would be great. Overall, it is a good headset for the price.",0
4.0,Great headphones for an amazing low price,"January 6, 2018",Yes,"As expected from the MPOW line of products, the acoustics are exceptional and ambient noise reduction is good as well. What I found challenging is the multifunction button located on the left ear, but with practice, it becomes less an issue for me. Ear pieces very comfortable. Like the dual concept of Bluetooth and standard plug-in. Price is amazingly low for the quality.",0
5.0,These headphones are amazing! They tune out a lot of background noise,"April 17, 2018",Yes,"These headphones are amazing! They tune out a lot of background noise. The battery lasts a super long time. They also connect to your phone/ipad instantly, I haven't had any connection issues.

5.0,Great Headphones!!,"January 15, 2018",Yes,I was looking for some Bluetooth wireless headphones that were a reasonable price and these ones kept coming up. I’ve had them for about 6 months now and I use them everyday. They are some of the best headphones I’ve had and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. The sound quality is great and the noise cancellation is perfect for when I want to study or block out noise. I would buy again!,0
5.0,I'd buy them again!,"February 16, 2018",Yes,I'll be recommending these to anyone in the market for headphones. Very comfortable over-ear design (and I have big ears!) and great sound quality. The appearance is sleek too!,0
5.0,Very awesome earphones. I love how you can either use ...,"April 3, 2018",Yes,Very awesome earphones. I love how you can either use them via bluetooth or hook them up with a cable.

5.0,Very happy . . . fit very comfortably,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"This bad boy is the bomb.  It was easy so set up, has great battery life, and fits very comfortably.  I'm picky on the comfort, so I was very happy about that.  Ones that I have used make my head/ears hurt after a while.  Not these.  For the price, hey . . . nice product!",0
5.0,Great alternative to Beats headphones!,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"These are the best headphones at this price point that I've tried. Sound quality is great, they look nice, and they sit very comfortably even though I have a small head",0
5.0,Great so far.,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"Sound quality is really good and the price is reasonable. I ordered these for my kids’ iPads. They work great. Packaging was good, but the box they came in was a bit crushed. I didn’t see any damage on the headphones themselves.",0
2.0,"Very cheap and flimsy, poor sound","October 3, 2018",Yes,"Unable to charge after 1.5 months - Item very cheap and flimsy. Sound quality is pretty bad. Never buy from Amazon ""best seller"" again. Trash.",0
5.0,Love them,"May 26, 2018",Yes,Good quality for the price. Loud sound and you can talk easily to others. Easy to connect to multiple devices. Long lasting battery.,0
5.0,Love it!,"October 25, 2018",Yes,"Great value for my money. The most important thing is that these so far have proven to be water proof. I sweat a LOT and no damage seen yet, and I have been using these for months. Highly recommend it!",1
5.0,Great product for the price,"June 28, 2018",Yes,"Great product for the price. If I stay too long with these headphones on, my ears hurt. In hot days is a little uncomfortable because the Soft Memory-Protein Earmuffs make you sweat",0

4.0,Great Product,"January 20, 2018",Yes,"It's nice size. got it same day delivery. The only reason it gets a 4 and not 5 because I thought it would have noise cancelling but you notice the echoes if you've ever HAD noise cancelling headphones. All in all, everything is good so far and the lower scores are pretty much ppl who had issues with delivery anyway.",0
5.0,These work great - delivery was prompt,"November 27, 2017",Yes,"These work great - delivery was prompt.  Very nice - someone can listen to t.v. at a louder volume than others prefer, or when others don't want to hear :)  Would order again.",0

4.0,"Very good headphones, small problem most likely just a defect","January 22, 2018",Yes,These headphones are wonderful I wanted to buy some that didnt have a $200-300 price tag and these over everything for a much cheaper price.

5.0,Just buy these!,"February 8, 2018",Yes,"Don't spend your money on Beats!  Get these instead and save money too!  I love all things tech and these headphones are amazing.  Easy pairing, long battery life, great sound, comfortable fit.  I'm in love!..UPDATE!  Still awesome!",0

3.0,Just OK,"October 1, 2017",Yes,These headphones are just ok. They do not do a good job of blocking out other noises. And their range away from the source is very short. But they are what you would expect for the price.,0
5.0,Works Perfectly! Bang for your buck!,"June 24, 2017",Yes,"Works perfectly, in fact better than I expected, especially considering the price. The company seems to make good products. Mic is good, I have had no problems with people hearing me (gaming and phone calls)..Soft and comfortable on my head (female and average size)..Even though it is not noise canceling, it does a pretty good job at it.",0
3.0,Waiting on a reply,"December 2, 2017",Yes,I LOVE the way these feel.  So much so that I’ve got an email into the seller reference a crackling sound  in the headphones.  I’m hoping that they’ll quickly send me a replacement  I’ll be sure to update when I know more.,0
5.0,This was a good investment! I brought these for my son and ...,"September 9, 2017",Yes,"This was a good investment!  I brought these for my son and he loves them.  There is no cord for him to get caught up in and they work great on his tablet.  When he finishes with them at night, I just plug them in and they are ready for the next time he uses them. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend this company.",0
4.0,The battery life is impressive and the sound is good. I found the bass at times to somewhat ...,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"For the price, these are decent headphones.

5.0,A great set for an affordable price.,"December 2, 2017",Yes,"This is a really nice set of bluetooth headphones.  It has great connectivity, and the sound is very clear.  The headphones are sound reducing, not  noise cancelling, but I actually find that more convenient.  The noises around you aren't loud or distracting at all, but if someone's trying to get your attention it's easier to tell.  The battery lasts very long; I can listen for ~8 hours/day at work all week long before I need to recharge the headphones.  All in all, a great set for an affordable price.",0
4.0,and loved them. The sound is great,"March 20, 2018",Yes,"I don't really write reviews, but I thought this would be the right ocassion. I previously had bose headphones, and I was looking for something that wouldn't break my budget. I was looking around and found these. I was hesitant at first but when I got them, I tried them out, and loved them. The sound is great, and the noise cancellation is pretty good. I've had ocassions where I can hear slight noise, but for the price of these headphones it's pretty good.",0
5.0,Very nice for the price,"July 5, 2018",Yes,Very nice for the price! Pairing was really easy and I'm quite happy with them..I'll probably purchase a second pair...,0

3.0,"Like me, they don't last long.","January 4, 2018",Yes,"It provides decent quality for what you pay, I mean they're headphones all you have to do is make sound go to ears it's not rocket science..As for the longevity, it leaves something to be desired, I bought these like two months ago and were comfortably audible at 50% computer volume, now I'm at 100% and it sounds like a whisper. In the long run buy yourself some good headphones as these don't seem to last very long.",0
2.0,"the package arrived very quickly, however, product description ...","January 25, 2018",Yes,"the package arrived very quickly, however, product description was a bit misleading. I have purchased it to use with TV, thinking it will be wireless... not so. Yes I know it describes as ""wired for TV"", but the wire is about 24"" long... who sits this close to TV???..disappointing​...",0
5.0,Headphones won't stay on for one call after the other.,"November 8, 2018",Yes,For the price these headphones are okay. Only problem I have is when I'm placing a call I have to constantly reset the headphones to Bluetooth phone or it just plays on the phone.,0

5.0,No doubt... The best!,"August 8, 2017",Yes,I had my doubts but not anymore. I work 12hr shift around noisy machines and the battery life easily runs music the whole day. Comfortable to wear and really cuts down the outside noise.,0
4.0,"Good product, microphone needs noise cancelling.","January 10, 2018",Yes,"Got this as a gift and they like it very much, only downside is when using the microphone it picks up anything and everything so it is very hard to hear in loud environments.",0
5.0,Great catch from Amazon in the Headphone section,"September 27, 2017",Yes,"What a surprising pair of headphones. Great sound, wonderful look and fantastic price. If there is a ""catch"" I have not found it. Great purchase. Yet again from Amazon.",0
5.0,I bought these for my 12 yr old Granddaughter and ...,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"I bought these for my 12 yr old Granddaughter and she loves them. Has told me she hears some static, but I didn't. What you do hear is your own footsteps as you walk without them being on. Very secure on her head...",0
5.0,The music sound so good with deep bass,"November 10, 2017",Yes,"I brought this mainly for playing mobile online games that requires the mic function alot. Bluetooth sound works well for gaming and OK for music(I grade it 60% of the sound quality compared to wired), but the biggest surprise is the actual sound when using the 3.5mm jack. The music sound so good with deep bass, that I almost throw away my JVC rx900 can I used alot. Best buy at this price point and I'm amazed how good &amp; comfy this product gives.",0
2.0,They look great and feel good on,"April 29, 2018",Yes,They look great and feel good on..The only problem with these headphone is the person next to you can hear what your listening to..Bought to wear on a flight and now worried I am going to annoy the people next to me because they are so loud.,1

4.0,Good functionality/design. Not the best sound quality,"November 28, 2017",Yes,"The sound quality isn't the best. Really no bass at all. Some white noise/ fuzz when not playing music. Functionality and looks are good. Over all it's great if you aren't picky about your sound quality. I you are, you should spend a little extra to get something better.",0
5.0,You will love these.,"July 11, 2018",Yes,"Great product for the price. Comfortable, great sound, and great battery life. My wife and I both have a pair, and will be suggesting these to anyone looking to buy a pair of good, inexpensive headphones.",0

2.0,barely average sound quality,"June 19, 2017",Yes,Fit is a bit tight. I wear a size 7 hat which is average in size and found the phones a bit too snug. Uncomfprtable after an hour or 2. However my biggest complaint would have to be audio quality. The Mid range and trebles Are Lacking. Sounds like muff are filled with tissue. I would nor recommend these. Price fits them in a medium quality build range. Sorry.,0
5.0,Great for casual music listeners and children,"November 13, 2018",Yes,Bought these for my ten year old after his beats started ripping. These are worth the money and the battery life lasts practically all day.,0
5.0,Excellent sound quality and very comfortable,"March 24, 2018",Yes,Excellent sound quality and very comfortable.  The volume control is easy to use.  No problems after a year of use.  I've never run the battery down all the way so I don't know how long the battery life is.  I usually charge after about 4 or 5 hours of listening.,0
1.0,apparently can't use with a laptop.,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"I was very disappointed. I bought it to use with my laptop, didn't realize that I could only use it with my Android phone. Haven't been able to get it to work with that yet either. This is not the best headphone set to buy if you're not text savvy. Going to have to have somebody who is, help me before I can start using it",0
5.0,working as intended,"March 8, 2018",Yes,"Fits will over ears, amazing noise cancellation, great blutooth range. Sound quality is perfect to my ear but I may or may not be an uncultured swine. Easy to use, too.",0
5.0,Headphones cut off bass if used with bluetooth,"September 19, 2017",Yes,"GREAT headphones for the price. HOWEVER NOTE THAT IF YOU USE BLUETOOTH, THE HEADPHONES WILL CUT OFF THE BASS FREQUENCY. If you use the 3.5mm cable included then the sound is very rich.",0
5.0,My teen loves these. At first she had a ...,"February 6, 2018",Yes,"My teen loves these. At first she had a hard time paring and would not let us help, but she figured it out and loves them. My only regret is that I did not purchase 2...she has a twin.",0
5.0,Price is RIght,"March 2, 2018",Yes,Very comfortable and adjustable.  Sound is quite good.  The light on the control side goes out once fully charged.  No negatives for me.,0
4.0,Excellent for the price,"March 30, 2018",Yes,Great for the price. Sound is good - not great - but excellent for the price point. Electronics work very well. Bluetooth connects seamlessly every time. Battery life is good. If you want to spend $200 you can get better sound like Bose but you won’t find better headphones at this price.,0
4.0,These headphones were purchased as a gift to my son ...,"January 29, 2018",Yes,These headphones were purchased as a gift to my son who likes them. He says they are extremely high quality and he has no complaints about them.,0

Eventually I will find some.😊",0
5.0,These are better quality than BEATS by Dre,"August 5, 2018",Yes,These are better quality than BEATS by Dre. I love Dre. But these are oddly better quality for an 8th of the price.,0
5.0,Suited for me,"August 31, 2017",Yes,This is a very sturdy headset. It feels like good quality. The sound is good and feels good over my ears. The price is reasonable. I would recommend this product and I would purchase it again.,0
4.0,and he seems to be happy with the sounds and quality,"January 2, 2018",Yes,"I purchased this for my teen aged son, and he seems to be happy with the sounds and quality. However, he did complain of the head phones squishing too much on his head; other than that, happy with the product.",0
5.0,Great quality for the money,"January 3, 2018",Yes,"Great base and sound quality.  Fits as expected over the ear, I am able to hear cars approaching while I'm running and people talking at the gym, but the music is in the center piece.",0
5.0,sound quality is nice,"October 18, 2017",Yes,Had a brief problem with the product which turned out to be something else BUT customer service was there for me all the way through trouble shooting.... Happy with purchase,0
4.0,Not quite perfect,"October 12, 2018",Yes,"I really like the feel, battery life, and button configuration of these headphones. These fit me quite well and are quite good at blocking out outside noise. However, the headband padding cover material came out after only a couple months of use. The sound quality could be a bit better and I wish the volume control buttons weren’t independent of my phone’s own volume control.",0
5.0,Great look and style,"April 12, 2018",Yes,"Love how they fit on my head and ears, they have incredible sound, I also have Bose headphones, but headphones are just as good",0
4.0,"Great battery life, not good for taking calls","May 31, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are great for listening to music, the battery lasts awhile before needing to be charged. But when you try and make a call the person on the other line can barely hear you. (Poor microphone!)",0
5.0,These headphones have surpassed my expectations.,"October 4, 2017",Yes,"These headphones have surpassed my expectations. They are very comfortable and do a pretty good job with noise cancelling. The build quality seems to be top notch for the price, and they sound great to boot! I love the wired/wireless capability, but I've mostly used them wired so far, so I can't speak to battery life or bluetooth quality. Overall though, I think these are incredible for the price, and the best value you'll be able to find.",0
4.0,Overall I'm happy with the purchase,"January 11, 2018",Yes,The sound is fabulous! Up there will the high end headphones. I have a small head so my only complaint is that I cannot get them to fit securely. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. Well worth the price.,0
5.0,I really like them,"September 2, 2017",Yes,"arrived quickly and as described. They really do fit comfortably and the sound is outstanding, especially when you consider the price. I would compare these to much more expensive headphones.",0

5.0,Incredibly comfortable,"February 25, 2018",Yes,"Very much like the feel, look &amp; functionality however my flat screen apparently does not support Bluetooth. Even with a separate transmitter. Both were returned without issue as the main goal was to watch TV yet not disturb girlfriend...",0
5.0,Good quality and sound and easy to use,"June 21, 2017",Yes,A lot of bang for the buck. Good quality and sound and easy to use. For the price it's a great product. I have a pair of studio Sony plug in's and these sound just as good. I would recommend them for sure.,0
4.0,You won't be sorry!!!,"October 27, 2017",Yes,"The ONLY thing I am not a fan of is the sweat.  I wear these when I lift weights and while I am already sweaty, the sweat around my ears is bothersome.  Otherwise they are great!  Sound is awesome.  Paired easily.  Folds up nicely. Great 1 touch operation!",0
3.0,Your average headphones,"May 2, 2018",Yes,"Not as good as I was reading from the reviews.  It's a bit heavier than other headphones I have had in the past and the padding does little to help cushion/distribute that weight.  Quality is above average, probably on par with similarly priced headphones.  The collapse able bits are continually collapsing, I don't think there is any sort of lock mechanism to keep them from collapsing.  Overall 3 stars, wouldn't buy it again.",0
5.0,Quality Sound at an affordable price!,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I don’t know how I lived without these!  Great sound at an affordable price.  Two things to note:  the color is more of a muted pink than metallic (in my opinion), and after wearing a few hours they became less comfortable resting on the top of my head (a little heavy but I was due for a break anyway).  So overall - Awesome!",0
5.0,Good Headset!,"July 5, 2017",Yes,Headset is fairly easy to use and operate. Arrived on time and packaged correctly. I have ordered another headset for a different device so they automatically pair with that device. They are great!,0
5.0,love these! And guess what,"March 19, 2018",Yes,"Finally upgraded to wireless over-the-ear headphones... love these! And guess what, so does my boyfriend... he steals them all the time. They have a little bit of a noise cancelling quality which is great if random noises stress you out (like me). The mic is kind of wonky but there are better options for that if that's what you're looking for. I recommend these highly if you want a bargain... pretty decent quality for a good price.",0
4.0,We still like them.,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"They work with the computer, but not the television about them hoping they would work for the television. We still like them.",0
5.0,Great product!,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"Good, dependable and easy to use. I use my headphones for traveling to work with my Kindle.  Charges quicker than my old headphones and connects easily too.",0

5.0,Kid Approved,"January 14, 2018",Yes,My son thanks me for these almost every time he uses them. He loves that they're both Bluetooth for his ridiculous jackless tablet or corded for his game system. He also geeked out over how they fold to fit in the case we bought to store them in (highly recommend one of those btw). Would definitely recommend/buy again.,0
5.0,was packaged nicely. The sound and quality are amazing,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"Arrived on time, was packaged nicely. The sound and quality are amazing, it blocks out a majority of the background noise so as not to disrupt what you are listening to.",0
4.0,Good sound,"March 11, 2018",Yes,"Just tried these out today, the sound is really clear but I’m obsessed with good bass and it isn’t really a bumping feeling that i was hoping for. If that’s not a big deal to you, then you’ll love these!",0
5.0,Great for use with pc for gaming.,"May 30, 2018",Yes,"The Mpow headphones sound clear and have a very good range from devices. I bought them to use while gaming on my pc. I was worried that they may have exaggerated bass. I am glad to say that bass, treble and mid range are all naturally represented. Great product for the price!",0
5.0,"Amazing, believe the reviews","April 11, 2018",Yes,"These are great. Great fit/sound quality/comfort. Easy pairing with devices. I was honestly surprised considering the low cost, but I went by the reviews and I'm glad I did!! These are the best headphones I've ever owned.",0
5.0,Awesome headphones highly recommended,"November 4, 2017",Yes,"Amaze with the quality of this product , the Battery last long. The sound quality is awesome. Pretty comfortable  For the price you can’t ask for more .Highly recommended",0

5.0,Great sound for him and quiet time for me!,"October 3, 2017",Yes,"Totally quiet experience now my husband is watching the living room tv and I can still walk around in peace.

2.0,They're comfortable but they have NO bass whatsoever,"February 12, 2018",Yes,They're comfortable but they have NO bass whatsoever. They are definitely not worth $35. Look for earbuds for the same price that have better sound quality,0
4.0,Good and Strange,"June 3, 2017",Yes,Sound is very good.  A little strange how you have to hold the on/off button till it cycles through the menu of turning headphones off.  But once you figure it out.  Its not so bad.  especially for the price.,0
5.0,Great Sound!!!,"March 27, 2018",Yes,These headphones are GREAT!! The sound quality is amazing... Almost like Bose but cheaper. Great for working out and stay on ears. Love the so far!,0
4.0,Nice headphones and comfortable when sitting,"January 29, 2018",Yes,"Nice headphones and comfortable when sitting.  Not the best for working out as they tend to make you very hot and sweaty.  For watching tv, reading or listening to music, they do a nice job.",1

5.0,Better quality for a fraction of the cost,"November 10, 2017",Yes,I paid 99.00 for a set of wireless headphones from my cable company and they broke within a month. I wish I had seen these first! Better quality for a fraction of the cost.,0
1.0,Power button broke on the 5th or 6th use,"March 10, 2018",Yes,Power button broke after 2 weeks of light use. Poor QC. I was very surprised since they're rated very highly on Amazon.,1
3.0,These are just ok. Sound quality is definitely not ...,"March 22, 2018",Yes,These are just ok. Sound quality is definitely not what I expected based on all these positive reviews. Seems to have a very weird mechanical sound. Not crip and clear. I guess you get what you pay for.,1
5.0,Ordered 2 more sets after loving my first set. It has been about a year since my first purchase and used everyday,"November 8, 2017",Yes,I have now ordered 3 sets of these headphones.

1.0,Cheap junk,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"Please don't buy cheap off-brand junk.  Had these a few months, now one side outputs sound, the other side hardly at all.  Constantly static, cuts-in-and-out with a poor connection when the phone is all of two feet away.  Oops and guess what?  If you need to use the cable, it is only 2-channel, so no microphone for you unless you're on BT.  There's no way to clearly know if you're turning it on or off unless you're listening to the audio coming out of it (it tells you with a weird spoken voice).  Like most cheap knock-offs you're better off to save your money on the real thing.",4

4.0,All around great product,"August 4, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are awesome. They are somewhat stylish and the sound quality is fantastic. Connecting with bluetooth is super easy but it also comes with an aux cord just in case. My only complaint is that after a while they start to hurt my head and ears, but I have a big head, so that might not be a problem for everyone. The battery life is super long, which is nice",0
5.0,Get ‘em,"March 8, 2018",Yes,I use these every day at work and want to buy a pair to have at home too. Great sound quality and pretty solid noice cancelling (my coworkers are loud).

5.0,I love them!,"February 27, 2018",Yes,"I've had these headphones for about a month now and they work great! I love that they come with an auxiliary cord for use when they aren't charged. The sound is good and goes pretty loud and the fit is comfortable though they start to hurt a little after two or so straight hours of wearing them. I got the green and black ones and they look great! Over all, they're just a really great pair of wireless headphones for the price.",0

5.0,Cute &amp; Comfortable!,"August 29, 2018",Yes,"These are great headphones for the price! The sound quality is decent and the cushioning is comfortable on my ears. I like that they fold so I can easily carry them in my purse, and the buttons on them are easy to use. The one con is that they get kind of tight on the top of my head so I have to take a break from wearing them every 2-3 hours but it’s not a big deal!",0
4.0,Great little headset especially for the price,"June 9, 2017",Yes,Great  little headset  especially for the price .  use it at the gym for working out hard with the over the ear speakers getting a little warm and sweaty as expected.

I love the sound , the phone was clear and I was able to run downstairs, with the music playing. I would recommend this purchase.",0
5.0,Great sound at a fantastic price,"December 31, 2017",Yes,"Great sound at a fantastic price. They don't cancel out the noise a ton, but they're not active noise-cancelling. I would certainly buy these again.",0
4.0,Excellent for Music and Gaming,"January 15, 2018",Yes,"For the price, these headphones are outstanding.  Great sound quality with clear lows, mids, and highs.  They also work great for gaming computers.  I gave it four stars because the bluetooth interface is a little archaic and the clarity when using it as a phone receiver is a little fuzzy.  But overall, great headphones!",0
5.0,They are comfortable and have great sound,"September 19, 2017",Yes,Wow! I'm very impressed with these. They are comfortable and have great sound. It's a great price for solid headphones.

5.0,Sounds staticky once paired with my phone.,"December 6, 2017",Yes,"When I pair the headphones with my phone, it’s very staticky. It sounds as if I have a broken wire attached to the headphones.

4.0,Get em!,"September 25, 2017",Yes,"Not bad for the price. The headphones are comfortable, stylish and sound pretty darn good considering the bargain price. My Beats headphones were stolen and I didn't want to spend another $300. To be honest I can't even tell the difference when wearing or listening. Battery seems to be good too.",0

2.0,"For $34 maybe, $35 nope.","September 1, 2017",Yes,"""Impressive sound quality"" as stated in the item description couldn't be farther from the truth. I have cheap ear buds that sound better than these headphones. Also, you know that deep bass you get with a high-quality stereo system? No? What about the bass you might get from an OK car stereo? Still no? One more try...you know the bass that little tiny speaker on your phone has? Yeah, that's the kind of bass you'll get with these headphones. None! The only reason I MIGHT not send these back is that they were only $34 and they might work well for listening to audio books while I clean my house. It would be disrespectful to any band you might listen to if you choose to listen to them on these headphones. Oh did I forget to mention the advertised 33-foot blue-tooth capability is not accurate? Try 20 feet. I'm not even going to try making a call to test the microphone because I would likely have to change the two-star rating to one and that just seems very negative..UPDATE:.These are garbage and being returned. I'd rather put the $34 toward a higher quality product. You really do get what you pay for.",2
1.0,"8 bit sound quality, Mic is very quiet","November 18, 2017",Yes,"Mic is very quiet (have it maxed out in Windows and barely picks up in voice chat), sound quality degraded after a couple weeks (sounds like 8 bit).  This was over a period of about 4 uses.  I cannot use this headset for the intended use of games.",1
5.0,These are great!,"December 5, 2017",Yes,"These are great, they cut out about 95% of noise so I’m able to focus while I’m at the gym but still pay attention to what’s around me. The music plays very clearly, manual was user friendly, and the green color is true to the picture. A significantly cheaper alternative to Bose/Beats wireless headphones.",0
2.0,Short lived,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"I've had this for 6 months and it will no longer charge. I did like them when they worked, quality of sound is great. Short lived.",0

4.0,Pretty decent for the price,"May 11, 2017",Yes,"Pretty decent for the price. They obviously don't have the sound you would get from a high end headphone, but for $35, I can't really see there being anything much better. They are a little bulky, but they are comfortable. I wore them for a couple hours the other day while listening to some music and my ears felt fine compared to other headphones I have used. All in all, a pretty satisfying purchase on a budget.",1
3.0,Sound is good but the design of the operating switches is annoying ...,"July 7, 2017",Yes,Sound is good but the design of the operating switches is annoying as they are all flush. So when it's on your ear you often end up pressing the wrong buttons. Example pressing stop instead of volume up. Also the build quality looks a little cheap.,1

3.0,Easy to use and good sound.....for everyone.....,"May 4, 2017",Yes,"These headphones fit great, are easy to operate and I love the sound quality! My ONLY issue is that people around you can hear your music loud and clear also ESPECIALLY if you're in a room that's slightly quiet. I like feeling as though I'm in my own club and no one else has access. But if you're okay with everyone being able to hear what you're listening to then this is a great deal. I haven't used it for a call yet, once I do I'll review this product again.",0
4.0,Good headphones,"January 19, 2018",Yes,"Works great with my phone and iPad, but takes some getting used to with bluetooth pairing and switching. Not for audiophiles as sound quality is average.",0

4.0,MPOW TO TV CONNECTION GREAT,"March 26, 2017",Yes,"Love my headphones. No sound leakage, and I can now listen to TV at any sound level without disturbing anyone. Took off one star because the set is a bit heavy, with a break-in time for general tightness around the ears, causing ear lobe pain. That pain was cleared when the earphones loosened up a bit.",0
5.0,Mpow Headphones,"July 28, 2017",Yes,"Got these for my husband for his birthday to go along with his new Ipad.  He loves them!  The red and black color look very ""classy"" and the sound is even better than my Memorex Headphones.  They shipped really fast too.  Highly recommend!",0

So far, I'm happy with this purchase and I'm considering ordering more as gifts.",0

They connected to Bluetooth super easily, while there's been a single instance of a weird sound disturbance, that could have easily been the video not the headphones. I love these especially because they fit comfortably over my big ears! I'm no sound connoisseur, but it works fine at being loud enough without too much bleeding and muffling outside noise. 5/5 from an unpicky layperson.",0
4.0,Bluetooth Headphones,"November 20, 2017",Yes,"A good headphone set for the money.  It is very comfortable and easy to use.  The sound is good but not excellent.  As I said, for the money it is a good set.",0

4.0,Phone doesn't transition with broadcast sound,"February 15, 2018",Yes,"The sound is great, but these may not be a good option for gamers because they dont transition between phone and speaker sound well.

5.0,Nothing bad to say,"April 23, 2018",Yes,Nothing bad to say. Everything is good. It connects fast and the battery seems to last for ever. I worked out 3 days straight each with about 2 hours. I have not charged it yet. It is amazing for the price.,0

I love the increased battery life compared to my bluetooth earbuds (Also mpow brand)..Bought these for my wife, and after trying them out, just ordered a second set for myself.

It looks like it can take a drop here or there, but i'd handle with care just as a precaution...Will update in a few weeks",0
4.0,Nice that they fold up,"January 28, 2018",Yes,Bought these as a gift so the person could tune out the other person in the room and whatever they are listening to.  Nice that they fold up.,0

I often have to fuss with the buttons to turn it on or off.  I have been trying for 5 minutes now to turn if off, pressing on every single edge and the middle of the button.  It won't turn off.. It doesn't pair consistently.  Who paid to get this item to say it was great. It is not.",0
5.0,Whatta deal,"February 28, 2018",Yes,Good quality for a great price. While not sound proof they are very close. Much better deal than buying beats for an absurd price.,1

4.0,... these headphones since Sept 2017 and the sound is pretty good and they are pretty durable,"January 12, 2018",Yes,I have had these headphones since Sept 2017 and the sound is pretty good and they are pretty durable.

1.0,Could have been really good if they actually worked,"June 12, 2017",Yes,Right side of headphones died within 10 minutes of me using it for the first time.  Could have been really good if they actually worked.,3

5.0,Great Value,"December 5, 2017",Yes,These have an excellent design and quality sound.  Seem to be durable.  Bluetooth functionality is also easy to use - bought for 4th grader who has been able to use wirelessly without any issues.,0
5.0,Perfect for me,"March 4, 2018",Yes,"These are the perfect headphones for me. I use them between my college classes and at home. They are very comfortable, good sound quality, and easy to connect to devices. I have glasses and they are even comfortable on top of those. They fold up nice and small for putting in my backpack.

5.0,very nice headphones. They work very well,"December 8, 2017",Yes,very nice headphones.  They work very well.  Just what I was looking for..  Shipping was very fast also. I wanted for my smart TV and they work great.,0

4.0,Awesome headphones.,"September 18, 2017",Yes,"Awesome battery life, have had them for a month and have not had to charge them yet. (I use them everyday for about 30min-hour)..The only reason for a less than perfect rating is that the padding around the ears isn't a very breathable material and causes quite a bit of sweat accumulation, and the sound quality is not the best, but great for this price point.",0
4.0,A good deal!,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"The Mpow Bluetooth Headphones are a good quality along with a good value. Although some reviews might complain about the comfort, I don't have an issue with that. I have a fat head, but I am able to wear the headphones for hours at a time. The reason why I only gave it four stars is because I think it has too much bass. Then again, that could be just a matter of opinion. Some other reviews for this product think the bass is fine. Nonetheless, I'm still keeping them.",0
4.0,Good price and quality,"June 7, 2017",Yes,"Ear buds always fall out of my ears so headphones are a must for me. I use them to run and workout. They are kind of bulky, sometimes mistaken as Beats Headphones, but I don't care...they stay on my ears. They are not noise reduction. I prefer them that way because I still need to hear the environment around me when I'm running outside.",0
5.0,Buy it NOW!,"August 17, 2017",Yes,"Absolutely love these headphones! I currently own a pair of Beats, but was tired of getting caught on the cord at the gym. I didn't want to spend another $300 for the wireless ones, so I took a chance on these. I charged them right out of the box and fell in love! Easy to pair once you read the instructions, and I'm still on the original charge. They're light, but very worth it. I plan on buying at least 3 more pairs as Christmas gifts.",0
5.0,Awesome for the gym,"May 19, 2017",Yes,"They fit comfortably on my fairly large head.  They don't have the sound quality Bose does but I would rank them on the better end of the spectrum.  I was very pleased with the overall sound quality.  They cancel out a lot of noise.  I've used these every day at the gym and periodically throughout the day, and the battery will last about 5 days of regular use.  I love the controls on the side and the voice prompts that coincide with disconnecting bluetooth etc.  I will definitely consider purchasing another for my wife.",0
5.0,I liked these so much,"May 22, 2018",Yes,"I liked these so much, I bought a second set. The range on these is better than advertised. The sound is better than the high end headsets.",0

5.0,Love it and I got 4,"October 27, 2017",Yes,Love the headset. I use for tv with mpow Bluetooth transmitter. The only thing I dislike is turn on off. So hard for some elderly to know to hold to turn on off,0
5.0,Amazing headphones! They are super comfortable and have a ...,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"Amazing headphones! They are super comfortable and have a crazy long battery life. You can connect two devices at once and use the built in mic for Bluetooth calls. If the battery dies, pop in an aux cable for a wired connection. Mic doesn’t work with wired connection. I was blown away with the quality!",0
5.0,GREAT HEADPHONES,"August 23, 2017",Yes,Love thiese headphones. Very comfortable.  Sound is great.  Need blue tooth because of special cover for my iphone 6S plus. Also price for the quality &amp; features is very reasonable.,0
5.0,These provide excellent quality sound and pairs well with both PC and ...,"June 3, 2017",Yes,"These provide excellent quality sound and pairs well with both PC and iPhone. Operation is straightforward. Comfortable to wear with the foam earpieces, although as a minor suggestion it would be nice to have a way to adjust the compression force on the ears. As with any sound-blocking headset, it gets a bit tight after a while, well before the battery charge runs out.",0
5.0,Working just as I had hoped!,"August 23, 2018",Yes,"I bought these to replace a pair of Bose wireless headphones. For a fraction of the price, these headphones are working much better than the Bose for pairing with my TV. The Bose headphones had to be paired each and every time I turned on the TV. These headphones stay paired AND sound great...and they're very comfortable!  So glad I bought them!",0
1.0,Died just after return window closed,"May 31, 2018",Yes,Worked great for 6 weeks and died just after return window closed. I also purchased a case to store them in when not used. Very light use; would likely have died sooner if used reguarly.,0

5.0,"Very comfortable, the elongated holes in the ear pieces allow ...","August 26, 2017",Yes,"Very comfortable, the elongated holes in the ear pieces allow for extended wear time. Sounds good, nice base. The mic is good also, people can't tell that I'm on a headset when we speak.",0
4.0,Great for the price!,"August 5, 2017",Yes,Great for the price! Very clean but lacking some bass. Power off button can be a little finicky considering there's three stages. 1) initiate 2) Bluetooth disconnect 3) power off,1
4.0,"Pairing this headphone with my iPhone is easy, I can hear my favorite songs in you ...","October 12, 2017",Yes,"Pairing this headphone with my iPhone is easy,  I can hear my favorite songs in you tube or on my phone with super base, the sound quality is perfect, I like it. Only problem is when I receive phone call, They can hear me well, but I don't hear them at all, I am still figure out what I am missing.

5.0,Great headphones &amp; great value,"September 6, 2018",Yes,"Very impressed with these Bluetooth wireless headphones.  Everything from pairing to charging to the features are simple and work great.  Sound quality is very impressive for headphones in this price margin.

5.0,These headphones were for my 10 year old son. ...,"September 17, 2017",Yes,These headphones were for my 10 year old son. He loves them. I would say they have noise-cancelling capabilities but I think he might just be ignoring me.,1
5.0,I LOVE these headphones,"September 3, 2017",Yes,"I LOVE these headphones.  The quality of sound, colour, everything is perfect. I've bought hundreds of products from amazon and eBay, and this is my 2nd. most favourite purchase.",0
5.0,The Bluetooth is very nice and she says they are comfortable,"November 6, 2017",Yes,My wife loves these for cutting the grass.  It drowns out the mower enough that she doesn't have to blast the music to overcome the noise.  The Bluetooth is very nice and she says they are comfortable.,0
1.0,"Works well for a couple of months, not worth it","May 6, 2018",Yes,These headphones were initially great for what I needed out of them then within 3 MONTHS they were already dying despite charging them for days. I would invest in more expensive headphones rather than having to buy another pair.,1
3.0,It is very hard to set this up. Can ...,"August 29, 2017",Yes,It is very hard to set this up. Can not find the controls on the headset. Not enough information in the small spec booklet . Did not come with a transmitter or sub adapter. Nowhere in the spec did it say they were needed. Really was hoping it would have worked for me. Had to send it back. Oh well,0
5.0,Awesome sound quality and performance!,"July 18, 2017",Yes,"These are awesome! I can leave my phone in my locker at the gym and they still pick up the bluetooth signal. AMAZING sound quality. Also, when laying down, for bench press, etc., they stay right in place. I have a smaller head, and I""m really happy with the fit, sound, and performance of these headphones.

5.0,Comfortable and Quality,"August 24, 2017",Yes,"I really like these, I am impressed by the battery life considering I've had them almost a month and only charged them when I first opened the box and workout on pretty much a daily basis with them. The sounds and volume is quality enough for me and I don't see any reason to spend money on high dollar brands, I've never had a more comfortable setup. I had Beats previously and like these so much more and you can't beat the optional and inexpensive warranty.",0
4.0,For the price you cannot find a better set of headphones.,"June 30, 2017",Yes,"Sturdy, high quality, and SUPER comfortable for the price.  I hate over the ear headphones for the most part.  I couldn't believe how comfortable these were.  Wore them for hours on a podcast and never felt uncomfortable...Not giving them 5 because 5 star reviews are bogus click bait.  Do your self a favor.  For the price you cannot find a better set of headphones.",0
2.0,Pay for what you get,"November 25, 2017",Yes,The sound is muffled and not clear. But I went from Beats to this so maybe that’s the issue. My dog chewed my Beats so I needed a cheaper replacement for the gym. These are very mediocre. The sound isn’t sharp. You can hear your music. That’s about it.,0
5.0,Cool headphones,"December 13, 2017",Yes,"Awesome headphones. Looks exactly as it's pictured. The battery power lasts for a long time, which is great for those long hours studying in the library. Headband hurts if you wear it too long, but that's to be expected.",0
5.0,"Bought these in June 2017, and now the sound ...","February 14, 2018",Yes,"Bought these in June 2017, and now the sound occasionally cuts off in one side if I move my head slightly. I'm surprised they lasted this long considering the price...Edit: The company is sending me a replacement. They were very easy to deal with and reimburse shipping costs.",0
3.0,it's okay,"October 16, 2018",Yes,"the headphone is really good if you connect it with your phone. Sounds horrible when you connect it with your laptop though. I used the adapter/ cable to connect it but it didn't change the sound quality. If you like strong bass, then this would be the perfect headphone set for you, just as long as you don't connect it to the laptop or computer.",0
5.0,I didn’t know how good these headphones would be considering they were $39,"January 28, 2018",Yes,"I didn’t know how good these headphones would be considering they were $39.99.  I was considering other name brand headphones but didn’t want to pay $200 or more for headphones.  I am glad I bought these.  They are super comfortable, they have great sound quality, and they were reasonably priced!  I know I will purchase more pairs for my wife and kids.  Great product!",0

5.0,Happy Camper,"February 26, 2018",Yes,These are amazing. I was so disappointed when my Beats by Dre broke. I went searching for new ones and much to my surprise found these. With thousands of 5 star reviews I had to try them. And wow... I was so happy with them I made my wife try them and next thing we knew we were buying another pair for her. We love them and would recommend them to anyone and everyone. A must buy.,0

I mean my favorite color is green but the reason why I'm ranking this 4 out of 5 stars..There is only one reasons why and that's because when I watch youtube, I get some MAJOR lag and stuttering.

I thought they would have to be charged daily/every other day.",0

It feels as if the space for my ears is not enough and it squishes my ears and it is really annoying after an hour or so. I am very dissaponted. They are also not loud or basy at all. Would like my money back. My cheap earbuds work better than this.,8
5.0,Great sound at an amazing price.,"February 7, 2018",Yes,"I am really enjoying these headphones. The sound is great (not that I'm some headphone or audio expert) and they cost a fraction of what some noise cancelling headphones cost.

5.0,Very comfortable headphones.,"February 24, 2018",Yes,"Very comfortable, decent sound quality both wired and on Bluetooth. Volume control could be a bit smoother on Bluetooth, jumps from slightly too quiet to slightly too loud on some media. Still, a great value.",0

The plastic feels cheap, and they lack the amount of bass I’d like to have, but again for the price they are a great buy. They are almost identical to comparable mtx headphones but with the addition of Bluetooth and controls built in to the headphones they are an obvious winner.",0
3.0,Solid product just too heavy!,"October 7, 2017",Yes,The sound was great but had to return as the headphones are very heavy and bigger than I thought. Tested them at work for full day and had a neck ache by the end.,0

5.0,Love these! I purchased an AUX cord so that ...,"April 27, 2018",Yes,Love these! I purchased an AUX cord so that I could be wired in and use on my laptop for video conferencing.  I listen to music all day long and it let's me be in a world of my own. I use the Bluetooth to listen to my TV up loud late at njght. I am super happy with them.,0

5.0,Very satisfied customer,"October 9, 2018",Yes,"I love the fact that this product is wireless and I could freely walk around my apartment with them, listening to my music or vids.  They don't work well when using a microwave oven, but meh.  And the battery life seems a little short to me, but also meh.  Still, good headphones for people like me who really can't afford to waste all that money on beats or boise.",0
5.0,Great quality wireless headphones!,"October 18, 2017",Yes,I love them! Great sound for music and clear sound for listening listening to audiobooks. Suited my needs perfectly. Came with connection to use as wired headphones too.,0

My only complaint is the ""mic"" on this - cannot get people to hear me. I would recommend these as a decent pair of inexpensive bluetooth headphones, wouldn't recommend them as a headset...UPDATE - After my initial concerns with the headset, the company had reached out to explain my concerns and wanted to resolve the issue. We did some troubleshooting and they had ultimately sent me a replacement that I am able to use the mic now. Thank you.",0
5.0,Awesome,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"kids love them.... a little too much.  My 12 year old needed new headphones since hers broke.

5.0,It works well for that purpose with good audio and relative comfort,"June 5, 2017",Yes,"I ordered these when abroad to watch Netflix movies on my tablet. It works well for that purpose with good audio and relative comfort. I did find it  a bit tight sitting on my head, but perhaps that will loosen up in time.",0
5.0,Quality Product,"January 16, 2018",Yes,"Love them. Work as advertised. Only thing wrong is that it does make my ears hot lol.Affordable, good sound. Best bang for your buck.",0
5.0,Worth it !,"March 10, 2018",Yes,These things sound pretty good right out of the box especially for as cheap as they are in comparison to others . The Bluetooth mic seems to sound fairly good as well . It doesn't hurt to use an equalizer app when using your mobile device but it really isn't necessary.Been jammin to some led zepplin all week and lovin it .,0
3.0,Good value.,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"Fast delivery, great price. Comfortable fit. The bass is less punchy than I expected. The highs and mids are decent for the price.",0

5.0,Son loves it,"December 7, 2017",Yes,"This was a gift for my son and he loves them. Great quality and has great sound, he says they are kind of noise canceling. He doesn’t have music too loud but he still can’t hear all the noise we make.",0

5.0,It worked great. The only problem was that most of the ...,"June 18, 2018",Yes,I bought these headphones so I could drown out the sound of everyone whining about politics and whatever victimization they were associating themselves with this week.

4.0,Bluetooth mode has a constant buzz...,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"If the headphone jack is plugged in they are silent until a sound is played. They work great! When the Bluetooth mode is on, there is a constant buzzing sound happening underneath everything. If no noise is playing (ex, muted a video) the buzzing gets louder. I just use them with the cord becasue that noise just bugs me out.",0
4.0,The sound quality is far above the expectation at this price point and the build quality is excellent. Add that to the fact that,"June 3, 2017",Yes,"For the price, you really can't beat this set of headphones. The sound quality is far above the expectation at this price point and the build quality is excellent.

I have only used them for music so I can't attest to the functionality of the microphone.",0
4.0,Works well and excellent value,"May 23, 2017",Yes,They were easy to pair to our bluetooth smart TV. Sound quality good for the price. Over ear design is a little uncomfortable when used with my plastic frame glasses. There is a little delay with the bluetooth sound vs. the TV set speaker sound resulting in a slight echo. I may be able to fix this with a delay adjustment on the TV. Works well as an aid to us older folks with hearing loss.,0
5.0,Husband's gift,"September 28, 2018",Yes,These far as price and quality did not disappoint. My husband loves to wear them mowing,0
5.0,Outstanding Headphones,"November 5, 2017",Yes,These fit me perfectly and sound great. I like them so much I bought another pair the next day. The price is very reasonable considering you can pay hundreds of dollars for lesser products.,0
4.0,A great buy overall,"April 28, 2018",Yes,"Can't beat the performance for the price. However, they lose a star as the passive noise cancellation is close to nil--I can easily hear conversations around me still, albeit muffled.",0
4.0,Four Stars,"August 21, 2018",Yes,"Good sound, fits great over my ears. Bluetooth works great too. I love this buy.",0
5.0,Great for airplanes.,"January 22, 2018",Yes,"I liked it the most because they worked for my husband on our plane trip and he could listen to a audio book and hear it clearly.It was in our price range which was great! I liked it also that you could plug it in or use the blue tooth,my husband prefered plugging bit in.",0
4.0,"Great, but shuts down when plugged to charge.","July 31, 2017",Yes,Great headphones! Sound is great and very comfortable on my ears...The one downside about this is that I they automatically shut down when you plug in to charge.,0
5.0,The solution to those $100+ set of headphones no one can afford,"July 20, 2017",Yes,Great headphones that are affordable. I workout everyday while wearing these and I sweat a lot without an issue yet. This includes weight training and running. I'd say they cancel probably 85% of the noise around you. I've been using mine (directly out of the box) for about 20 days now for about an hour a day and haven't charged them once.,1
5.0,Simple to use; Works great!,"January 26, 2018",Yes,"Hi, I like this Bluetooth headphone set.  I use it to watch movies without disturbing my family if it gets too late at night.  Simple to use; works great.  Thanks!",0

2.0,"Sounds fine though, and they are comfortable","December 8, 2017",Yes,"They don't turn themselves off and it's hard to tell that they're on.  Difficult to pair with multiple devices.  Charging is slow.  Sounds fine though, and they are comfortable.",0
5.0,I love these headphones,"March 1, 2018",Yes,"I love these headphones. I had the bluetooth Alec headphones first and they worked for about a week before I had problems. But these are amazing! The quality is great and the reception stays crystal clea, even when I'm in another room!",0

5.0,"If I have the volume pretty high, I think people around me can hear ...","August 8, 2017",Yes,"Can't beat it for the price. It does not have noise canceling technology, but I still do not notice surrounding noises much. If I have the volume pretty high, I think people around me can hear it. I use this product at the gym where everyone has headphones so this doesn't matter much. They fit over my ear and do not move while on cardio machines. I have been using this product for about an hour 5x a week for the past 3 weeks and the battery is still at 80% since receiving it, so great battery life.",0
4.0,Three Stars,"July 18, 2017",Yes,After using these headphones for over a month I have to say they're better than I thought at first. Sound was different than my earbuds but still good quality &amp; the price is good.,0
2.0,"Too tight, do not fit an adult male head","September 21, 2017",Yes,"The headphones work great, but they are too tight for my head!  Were they built for children or teenagers?  I'm surprised they don't adjust more than they do.",0
4.0,"Super comfortable headphones, but a little too loud for others","December 6, 2018",Yes,"I actually have grown to really like these headphones. At first, they were uncomfortable on my head, but after a few days, I was able to feel comfy with it on. The sound is great and the muffs basically hug your ears, but one thing I really dislike is that if you turn your music on too high, basically everyone can hear it. I just wish it was more soundproof.",0
1.0,Not a good head set that will last.,"October 25, 2018",Yes,Stopped working after two months. Two months in it started to get alot of static in the sound quality then two weeks later it stopped working all together..I definitely DON'T recommend this item. Your better off with a wired set.,0
5.0,Great headphones,"January 3, 2018",Yes,Extremely comfortable and good at blocking noise. My son loves them. Good quality sound too. Excellent headphones especially for the price.,0

5.0,Snug but comfortable,"September 29, 2018",Yes,"Awesome value for the price. I use them when I run on my treadmill and they don't fall off or even move around (which is why I've never been happy with any type of earbuds). These are snug but very comfortable, not pressing on my ears. Also, I know they're not advertised as ""noise cancelling"" but they actually do this too... All in all, very pleasantly surprised.",0
5.0,Good bang for the buck.,"January 9, 2018",Yes,"This was a gift for my daughter. She says that they were easy to pair with her phone and they sound good to her. If she's happy, then I'm happy.",0

2.0,These were good for a few months of sporadic use on an ...,"September 18, 2018",Yes,"These were good for a few months of sporadic use on an initial charge, which lasted a while. Unfortunately, now that they were used more frequently and initial charge ran out, they won’t charge. So they’re useless...Just commenting on the durability of the product, as I’m not an audiophile and was just looking for a serviceable pair of wireless headphones.",0
4.0,"Sounds great, but the other reviewers are correct","September 1, 2017",Yes,"Sounds great, but the other reviewers are correct, the headset can get tiring on the head. I have never had to say that before about other headphones. Granted I would wear them for about 4+ hours.",0

I would recommend these to a friend.",0
5.0,Exceptional quality sound for the price,"September 2, 2017",Yes,"Great sound, comfortable and charged fast. I have only worn them twice while working out and have not received a call on them, but as far as sound quality for the price, it is exceptional.",0
5.0,Fantastic value,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"Was expecting these to suck for the price, was really impressed with overall quality. I use these every day while commuting and riding my bike for fun; they aren't sweatproof or waterproof but I rode in the rain for over an hour and had no issues, worked just fine. Highly recommended.",0
4.0,Great if you don't mind everyone else listening with you,"June 16, 2017",Yes,"They are really easy to set up and use, the sound is great and they stay connected to my phone while I walk around my apartment. The reason for the four stars is that everyone can hear what you are listening to as well. I got these because I travel for work and I wanted a pair of over ear headphones for music on the plane. Now I am worried about disturbing other people with what I am listening to.",0

5.0,Comfortable,"August 20, 2017",Yes,"These are the first headphones I have ordered off amazon and I am pleasantly surprised. They completely fit around my ears and they are also not too tight around my head. The only draw back is that I got the impression that they were smaller than they are, and when they came I put them on and they are huge. I thought that would bother me a lot but they are comfortable and have good sound so its not a big deal",0

But after a couple of moths, all of the sudden, when the phone is connected with the AUX cable, it plays only on the left side (the side where the cable plugs-in), However, when playing through the Blutooth, both sides work fine.

Clear &amp; loud sounds produce with this Bluetooth headphone, i love it.

3.0,The sound these headphones deliver is good. But they rest on the top of my ...,"October 17, 2017",Yes,"The sound these headphones deliver is good. But they rest on the top of my head and after a minute or so, it hurts. I re-adjust and move the top band to a different spot on my head and ... rinse and repeat. They say they're size 'L,' if that matters. I wish they were more comfortable because I like the sound. I haven't tried their bluetooth linkup to anything yet.",0
5.0,A good deal! Worth the money.,"August 18, 2018",Yes,"Great sound out of these headphone...I liked them so much, I bought my husband a pair and also the case for our 10th anniversary as his gift.

4.0,Great bang for buck,"May 1, 2018",Yes,"Great for the price. Build quality is solid, fit is snug. Sound quality is good (has a noticeable mid frequency scoop, which is not ideal for audiophiles, but fine for casual listening).

5.0,"Stupid-Comfortable, Excellent Value","February 8, 2018",Yes,"Wow.  I clearly did not expect these to be this comfortable.  I've got big ears, a shaved head, and fairly thick plastic-framed glasses, and these feel like I've barely got anything on.  Couple that with good noise isolation, the freedom of wireless capability, and pretty good sound quality for the price...  Excellent value.  Would recommend to a friend.",0
4.0,I like it but only problem,"March 21, 2018",Yes,"I like it but only problem, if you use them on ps4, microphone doesn't work. Otherwise it's good for the price.",0

5.0,finally a company that makes quality at low price,"August 27, 2018",Yes,Finally an honest company that makes a product for a consumer that is high quality at a low price and we do not pay for branding on a sub par product at 100 dollars plus a price.

5.0,Excellent product,"August 12, 2018",Yes,I bought these for my 10 year old son for Christmas. He’s not exactly gentle with these and yet they have held up beyond my expectations. I’ve used them several times and the sound quality is pretty good and the battery life is great.,0
4.0,Good headphones for the price,"September 6, 2017",Yes,Generally they work great.  My one quibble is with the on/off/pair switch which doesn't always work the way you expect it to work.  A simple 3 way switch would be better and easier to understand.,0
5.0,Meh.,"January 25, 2018",Yes,Loved them for the first two weeks. Now they work whenever they feel like it and only plugged in. You get what you pay for.

5.0,It works great! I love it,"February 28, 2018",Yes,It works great! I love it. My ears sweat a little when I'm wearing it but that's because I wear it while cleaning. The charge lasts and the clarity and noise canceling is awesome.,0

I've had them for almost three months, use them 3-4 times a week for about an hour per gym session, and I've only charged them TWICE. They haven't died on me yet. Firm fitting even when jogging and working out... Overall, just an amazing deal for stellar headphones.",0
5.0,VERY IMPRESSIVE!,"September 12, 2017",Yes,"I have only had these headphones a couple of days, but I am VERY impressed! They are very comfortable, and they linked with my various devices quickly.

3.0,Flat sound,"October 3, 2017",Yes,"The main issue with the headset is it has very flat sound. Not really enough bass to round out the sound. I'm not a ""bass head"" but these clearly lean more on the highs then lows. Causing the feeling of a flat speaker.",0
5.0,Fantastic for the price,"May 21, 2017",Yes,"Fantastic for the price: does what I want them to do.  I wear them at at the gym 4 days a week, and several days a week as I walk around a local shopping Mall.  We spent 10 times as much for our son's headphones for his birthday.  Didn't make sense for me to spend that much $$$$ for me to listen to 70s &amp; 80s Rock &amp; Roll.",0
4.0,Work great. I have a large head and they fit ...,"July 30, 2017",Yes,"Work great. I have a large head and they fit fine. They stay charged for a long time. Only things ive been less impressed with are:.Could have more bass, not looking for major bass just a lil more..The bluetooth is a lil slow. You either have to hit pair or connect on your device. Not a big issue just used to my bluetooth devices connecting soon as i turn them on..Even with those i would still buy again, good price for what ya get",0
5.0,Great headphones!,"December 6, 2017",Yes,Great headphones. Great price point compared to the price you pay. No problems pairing and reconnecting.They have not dropped a signal yet.,0

4.0,Pretty good headphones for the price,"May 29, 2017",Yes,"I've been using these only for about a week so these are just my initial impressions...Good:.- The bluetooth synced with my Samsung s7 and my Windows 10 computer without any issues..- The headphones do a nice job of blocking out background noise. (They are not noise canceling, but the over ear design does a good job of blocking out sound.).- They seem solid and well made. The foam is nice and soft..- Can adjust volume using the buttons on the headphones rather than having to use the phone all the time..- You can plug them into your phone and keep listening even if you run out of battery for the bluetooth..- They fold up and fit in a nice little carry bag that it comes with for easy carrying...Not so good:.- For me, these are not comfortable to use for more than about an hour or so. They squeeze your head and ears pretty tightly and after a while, it is too uncomfortable to wear. Despite the softness of the ear cups, my ears always start to hurt after wearing these for too long, so I still need to keep other headphones around to switch out. In all fairness, they do mention in the description that you should take them off every couple hours to give your ears time to rest. (For reference, I wear a size 7 3/8 inch fitted baseball hat. If you're a different size, they might be more comfortable for you.).- The sound is very bass heavy. Depending on the type of music you listen to, this may be a good thing. However, I listen to mostly audiobooks and podcasts and it does not sound great for this. The voices seem muffled and not sharp. This could likely be fixed by fiddling around with the EQ on my phone..- The sound quality is lower when streaming over bluetooth than when using the provided cable. I don't think this is a problem with the headphones themselves, just a fact of streaming the audio over bluetooth...Overall, for the price and considering the bluetooth works well, these are not too bad.",4
5.0,he hears the sound just fine and clearly,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"He loves these! He says that even while riding a tractor, he hears the sound just fine and clearly!!",0
5.0,Other than that I love their audio quality with music,"January 25, 2018",Yes,"Originally purchased to connect to my PS4 bluetooth, however due to lack of research on my part Sony only has a select few bluetooth audio devices they allow to pair, this not being one, I was able to connect via cable to my controller. Other than that I love their audio quality with music, their weight feels great (sturdy construction), and the over-the-ear pads are awesomely soft.",0

5.0,Awesome for the price,"December 29, 2017",Yes,"Awesome for the price.  Sound is good.  I prefer a little more bass.  The battery lasts me all week for using it hours per day.  Wireless is great.  The microphone works well for phone calls.  I miss my old O'Neal wired headphones with good bass but I broke 2 of them and one phone output slot from the wired catching on my office chair.

1.0,Sound quality is not balanced,"September 12, 2018",Yes,"Have had really good luck with this company, but these headphones disappointed. I do not know if the pair I got was defective, but the sound was significantly quieter on one side. Would recommend spending a bit more if I was buying again.",0
5.0,Very good sound quality,"January 10, 2018",Yes,"Very good sound quality, very comfy.  While not designed as noise cancelling they do a very good job of blocking any outside sound.",0
5.0,Solid product,"February 28, 2018",Yes,The only complaint I have is the bass. There's no way to adjust the bass. That aside they still sound great.,0
5.0,Great headphones,"August 8, 2017",Yes,Bought these for my daughter to replace the headphones I bought her a year ago. She LOVES them! They adjust easily and feel great on her ears. The added bonus of not needing the cord plugged into the laptop/device is nice also.,0
4.0,MPOW VS JAM TRANSIT,"June 9, 2017",Yes,"Just received the headphones. I had a pair of Jam Transit headphones. The ear piece came off on one side. Sound wise, the Jam product was better sound wise with less bass or low range and separation...MPOW Good points, more comfortable, hooks up quicker, sound is good with the exception of the bass. Can't comment yet on the battery life.",1
5.0,Great for the price!,"December 12, 2017",Yes,These are great headphones for the price! I purchased this for my teenage son and he loves them! Sound is great and they're comfortable to wear.,0
5.0,These are great headphones especially for the price,"March 5, 2018",Yes,These are great headphones especially for the price.  Love how they fit on the head.  They are a little big for my 3 year old but great for my 6 and 9 year old.,1
5.0,he is very happy with them,"November 15, 2017",Yes,"I got these for my husband as a gift; he is very happy with them.  He loves the over the ear aspect and the sound is very ""crisp.""",0
4.0,wire length,"November 21, 2017",Yes,"Headphones are fantastic, no flaws what so ever. I'm only returning it and getting my money back because the wire for connecting it to a computer is too short for me. The front of my computer's audio hole jack for some reason doesn't work, but the back of my computer does, if i connect it it's super uncomfortable and it's just..... I can't deal with it. I wish the headset had a longer wire so I wouldn't have to return it and buy a less cool headset. ;(",0
1.0,Terrible sound,"December 18, 2017",Yes,"The embedded microphone is terrible. When I am in a call, the sound of my voice seems to be coming from a tunnel (tested several times with my colleagues from work - who would kindly enough stand the awful sound my voice makes). Wish I could return it. But I tried to give this headphone a chance. Don't buy it. This is one of those purchases that you regret you'd done it because the price was attractive and you thought would be a good purchase.",0
5.0,Great headset,"November 9, 2017",Yes,"Great headset. I’m using mine primarily for watching tv in bedroom. Great sound, comfortable fit, and they fold up for easy storage. Shipped quickly and easy to set up.",0
5.0,"I really like these, however they do not cancel out any ...","March 12, 2018",Yes,"I really like these, however they do not cancel out any outside noise. Not a problem for me. These are even comfortable and work well with hearing aids where most headphones hurt or don't put the sound in the right place for hearing aids to work. So impressed we got another pair!",0
3.0,"Amazing, But Not The Best","July 11, 2017",Yes,"This headset is amazing, don't get me wrong. However, by the third time I used it, I noticed that the sound quality is imbalanced. The left side is louder than the right side. Also, the sound quality of the microphone isn't good if you want to depend on it for calls. Then again, I used it on my Mac, so I'm not sure if it is suppose to be high quality for this device. The audio quality also drops considerably once the call is connected. Maybe it's not compatible with discord?",0
5.0,Great pair of headphones,"July 30, 2017",Yes,Great pair of headphones. Great balance of sound and noise isolation. Bluetooth connection lasts forever (~14 hours). Wired cored option is nice as well for using with devices that are not bluetooth compatible.,0
4.0,Great overall for the price,"April 10, 2018",Yes,"Great overall for the price. Sound quality is good. Keep in mind, these are no Bose or Beats headphones..Only complaint is that the sound sometimes cuts out and requires you to reboot the headphones for a fresh bluetooth connection.",0
5.0,Bought 3 more!,"November 15, 2018",Yes,These are great for the price and I ended up buying 3 more!,0
5.0,Great quality product,"October 13, 2017",Yes,"Great quality product, easy to sync with my iPhone, good sound. I am very happy with this product!

5.0,comfortable,"November 10, 2017",Yes,"i tried its bluetooth and it was working just as it should, the company sacrificed the unboxing experience for the headset's quality.",0
4.0,These Dont Suck.,"July 29, 2017",Yes,"Battery life is better than expected.  Pairs easily.  The sound quality is good, the bass response isnt the best I've ever heard in a headset, but it is better than many I've listened to. I have a big head and these fit comfortably, however I noticed that my ears barely fit inside the cups entirely, so for someone with bigger ears, they would sit on the ears and not around. They fold up nicely and come with a small cloth carrying bag, definitely dont suck.",0
5.0,I Like it,"August 29, 2018",Yes,I like it. Seems to be much higher quality than the ones I had before.,0
5.0,Happy with purchase,"July 15, 2017",Yes,Just got home from a long international flight and these were awesome. They blocked out the other noises on the plane and had great sound quality. Very happy with them!,0

4.0,Good Sound. Good Feel. Good Price.,"January 8, 2018",Yes,I am really enjoying these headphones. They are sleek and have a really nice design. The sound is adequate—not the best I’ve heard—but by no means bad. They are very comfortable and do a great job at cancelling the outside noise. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a very solid pair of headphones for a very reasonable price.,0
5.0,No problem good quality and cheap for it price,"August 20, 2017",Yes,Now i can write a review! I been using this headset for over 5 months now and almost everyday. No problem good quality and cheap for it price. Well done!,2
5.0,Much more than I expected,"December 17, 2017",Yes,Good quality for the price.  I have been very satisfied with my purchase of this product and have no problem in recommending it to others. The headphones are comfortable to wear and produce excellent tonal quality listening to music.  i was very surprised when I learned that they can also be used for telephone calls and work very well for that purpose.,0
2.0,Kinda disappointed.,"September 16, 2017",Yes,"I'm unsure what to think of these. They work fine yet their a bit tight on my ears(I know you can adjust them).  The audio I hear is weird, it sounds as of I'm on the phone and it's not the best. I'm using these with my desktop yet my old usb gaming headset has better sound quality.  I'm disappointed sadly because they're amazons best seller but this just lets me know to look around more.",0
5.0,Sound great,"April 8, 2018",Yes,For the money they are great. Sound good just don't try listening to high. They are good. Glad I bought them.,0

4.0,Good buy could use some work.,"July 21, 2017",Yes,So I like these headphones. Only problems I run into is great difficulty pairing with a different device after first pairing with my PC. I'd love to use these on a mobile device too. I plan on looking up more info to see if I can figure out what I'm doing wrong. Another issue is randomly the sound will make a gargle or there will be a hiccup when listening to music. Also sound quality on a skype call wasn't as crisp as I expected after wonderful music sound.,0
5.0,Amazing sound quality and very user friendly,"March 31, 2018",Yes,Who needs Dr. Dre beats when you can get these for a 16th of the price?? Amazing sound quality and very user friendly. Not to mention the battery life is spectacular. Also very long distance for Bluetooth range,0
1.0,Will not recharge,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"This product will not hold a charged.  It worked once and won’t charge ever since this isn’t a quality product, or maybe I just got a defective one.",0
5.0,phone calls and all are very clear and has a nice range and they are,"March 13, 2018",Yes,"very much worth the price. music, phone calls and all are very clear and has a nice range and they are comfy",0
4.0,"Very good, but the top pad should be softer","April 11, 2018",Yes,"Very good, but the top pad should be softer...hurts the top of my head after a little while of wearing them.",0
4.0,I wish they were a little more tighter fitting for ...,"March 30, 2018",Yes,I wish they were a little more tighter fitting for intense exercise but it's not their intended purpose so it's ok.,1
5.0,Fantastic,"January 27, 2018",Yes,"Comfy, they fit over my glasses which is a plus. Does a good job at blocking noise. Mainly use it to play music when doing homework when husband plays video games, I'm able to concentrate better than not using them. Love the Bluetooth, I can go for a run with out the annoying cord. Defenitely recommend",0
4.0,Nothing Amazing but Manageable,"November 23, 2018",Yes,"Recieved in good time, liked it and connected well to phone.  However, the sound is often choppy.  No other complaints.  Not the best quality for the price.",1
4.0,"The sound is fine, they work just fine","October 16, 2017",Yes,"The sound is fine, they work just fine. But I guess my head was either too big for the plastic or it's just cheap. It's cracking right now and looks to break any time soon...Update: I was out of the country for a few weeks and discovered the team had sent me replacements while I was gone. Stellar service and the new ones have been working just fine. Still worried about the plastic casing but it's held up so far, great customer service though, above and beyond.",0
4.0,Wow how the heck did they do this...,"February 20, 2018",Yes,Hi potential buyers just purchase these..I am a part time musician and spent enough coin on bs components to be called an audiophile. These things flat out rip for the money. I could quibble about clarity and realism as i have owned a few pairs of grado s  &gt; but nah just a great pair of phones for the money,0
5.0,... my son he said it was very light and nice to wear he loves,"June 27, 2018",Yes,it was a gift to my son he said it was very light and nice to wear he loves it,0
5.0,Great product,"May 8, 2018",Yes,"This product arrived on time and just as displayed. Sound quality was really good, and they definitely cancel out noises around you. It came with a charging wire and the adapter to plug it into devices which was great becausey laptop doesn't have Bluetooth. However, I can't charge them and use them at the same time which kind of sucks. We bought the pink and the red/black ones. Ould definitely buy again!",0
5.0,Comfortable and good sound,"March 16, 2018",Yes,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother.  He loves it!  Said it was comfortable and has good sound.,0
5.0,Nothing beats it for the price,"July 4, 2018",Yes,The headphones work great at the gym. So awesome I have two pairs. I keep a pair in my gym bag that I only need to charge once or twice a week with daily use.,0
3.0,A Little Disappointed..,"February 1, 2018",Yes,"I’m a professional music producer and  I bought these bluetooth headphones because I broke my old pair and was in desperate need of a new set. I  Heard about them through a well known and trusted tech blog. While these headphones are great in terms of wear, adjustment and even sound quality the highest volume is way too low. It’s slightly above a whisper in my opinion. Didn’t live up to the hype in my eyes.",0
5.0,Best headphones I've ever owned,"December 6, 2017",Yes,"Best headphones I've ever owned.  I had been in the market for a pair for about a year, and after reading review after review of at least 100 pair, this one seemed like a winner.  What I love most is the fact that they can go from Bluetooth to wired, with the included 3.5mm cord.  So I can listen to music while on the go, as well as use them while playing my keyboard or guitar.",0
5.0,Impressive,"June 26, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones, arrived early and the sound is pretty good for the price. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a wireless headset for working out.",0

5.0,Great headphones. The best part for me was when ...,"October 15, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones. The best part for me was when they broke...I know this sounds odd but trust me. The control button popped off and I couldn't get it back on so they sent me a new set at no cost (Ok, it did take a bit of back and forth for them to do so but in the end they did). The second set has been great and I've had no issues since.",0

5.0,Great choice for Bluetooth Headphones,"April 10, 2018",Yes,Great sound quality and very easy to set up.  The ability to use a cord when they are not charged is so helpful.,0
5.0,Super comfy unlike earbuds,"September 14, 2017",Yes,"We bought these for my kiddo, who loves them, but I've stolen them for my walks. Super comfy unlike earbuds, great sound quality and I love the controls on the ear.",0
2.0,UNCOMFORTABLE,"July 22, 2017",Yes,"Uncomfortable, designed to fit infant size ears! Control design is poor, controls need texture or individual buttons. Signal distance is barely 25 feet. Sound quality and noise canceling is pretty good, except when listening too talking ( audiobook / news ) fair!",0
5.0,The ear pads are comfortable and the headset is very light,"April 20, 2017",Yes,The headset works well for the price.  The ear pads are comfortable and the headset is very light.  The controls are easy to use.  Note: If you are using this for use while talking on a mobile device that there is no way to mute and unmute on the headset itself and you must use the mobile phone device mute/unmute.  Otherwise works well.,1

I have some hearing lost and to watch TV the volume was set on 60+ And still I couldn't hear all the dialog.  Now I can hear everything.  Pairing was a snap.  Very comfortable to wear for a long time.  Great product.,0
5.0,I love them. Everyone can hear what I'm listening to ...,"January 30, 2018",Yes,"I love them. Everyone can hear what I'm listening to when I use them at a high volume, though. Charges slow, but it's so worth it since the battery lasts ""16 hours"". But since no one listens to music 16 hours a day, it lasts for DAYS.",0
4.0,Very decent pair of headphones,"September 9, 2017",Yes,"I'm by no means an audiophile, but these work very well for general everyday use. The sound quality seems to be quite good, though the controls are a bit un-intuitive at times and , like all headphones, they become uncomfortable after long-term use. Overall, these are a very nice set of headphones for the money.",0
5.0,Good for the price,"November 22, 2018",Yes,Would’ve liked an easier way to turn off. But suoer cute and good battery life,0

They may not be for the hardcore audiophile, but for general video game playing, listening to music, youtube whatever, these do the job fantastically.

1.0,Huge earphones with subpar sound,"April 7, 2018",Yes,These are HUGE. They look like the noise cancelling joints for air traffic control or something. I’m sorry I didn’t take pics before returning. The sound quality is also subpar. The apple earbuds produce better sound. I took a chance because of all the positive reviews. Should have listened to the negative ones.,0
5.0,Awesome!,"December 25, 2017",Yes,"I love these headphones! They hold a charge forever and cancel quite a bit of surrounding noise out so you can enjoy music while walking, working out, or doing chores",0

5.0,High quality headphones-very comfortable!,"March 15, 2018",Yes,Very nice headphones. I ended up buying two of them-one for my husband and the other for my 11 year old daughter because they kept fighting over the one pair. The ear pads are extremely soft and the sound quality is crystal clear. These are well worth the price!,0
5.0,Very pleased with this purchase,"January 13, 2018",Yes,Very pleased with this purchase.  I bought the silver/black pair for my husband and the pink pair for myself.  Even with the size difference of our heads they fit both of us very comfortably. This was not our first Mpow purchase.

5.0,I’m a klutz!!,"August 11, 2018",Yes,I go through headphones pretty easily; I leave them places and even though I’ve dropped them a bunch of times they still work fantastically. I even use them to work out it was worth every penny spent!,0
3.0,dont buy for gaming with friends,"October 3, 2017",Yes,This headset is not a solution for playing games with friends on a teamspeak application like discord. You will not be able to get audio for any other programs while using this in a voice application because of the limitations of bluetooth... I think. I will be returning,0
4.0,Great for private listening and mobility,"September 8, 2017",Yes,I bought these for my 11 year old son so we would not have to listen to his computer games.

3.0,"A bit wide, but great quality and battery life.","October 19, 2017",Yes,"The sound quality is great, and they have a great battery life. It only lost two starts because if personal reasons: it hurts my industrial piercing, and mostly they just look really wide on your head. I use them for working out, which they're great for!",0
2.0,Two Stars,"February 22, 2018",Yes,"I must revise my review.  My son said these were broken, but I checked afterwards and they weren't.  I feel terrible about giving the product a bad review.  The seller just sent me replacements, and I hadn't even asked for them!!  (I need to send back to you, I'm SO sorry!)  Anyway, these are great for the price!!  Thank you for being so on top of it!!",0
5.0,So far so good,"April 15, 2018",Yes,"I've only used these a couple of times so far, but so far they're great! I like that they block the majority of noise, but you can still hear if someone close to you is asking if they can get by you or if a treadmill is taken. Definitely beats fighting cords, anyway",0
4.0,Four Stars,"January 24, 2018",Yes,I expected better sound quality. Product finish is good and the battery last for long hours...Edit: Customer Support contacted me and they sent me a free replacement Mpow H2. The new headset is really good and feels much higher quality. I increase my review with one more star just for the great customer support.,0
5.0,Perfect investment,"November 28, 2017",Yes,Amazing!! Great sound and great price!  Ear buds do not stay in my ears so I’m constantly putting them back in on my runs.

5.0,Super Comfortable!,"April 25, 2018",Yes,My son researched headphones for a while (and saved his money!) and chose to purchase these. He LOVES them!! They are easy to use and very comfortable. He asked me to try them on and I agree. The padding over the ears and on the top is lovely. He likes the functionality of the buttons and was able to easily pair them with his devices.,0
5.0,Love em!,"January 9, 2018",Yes,I love these. I refuse to pay hundreds of dollars on an expensive name brand. These sound good and fit good. Perfect for me at the gym.,0
5.0,I'm very impressed so far!,"May 19, 2018",Yes,"So far, one of the bests headsets I've bought in years. It charged in a relatively short among of time. It synced instantly with my PC's Bluetooth. The signal doesn't break up as frequently when I move my head, as it did with my other headsets.",0

I put them on and listen to relaxing sounds without being distracted by people walking past me constantly. They are very comfortable. Battery life is okay. The cord could be a little longer for charging or if you want to plug in instead of using blue tooth. These aren’t Bose quality. All in all, not too shabby for the price. I’d recommend them.",0
5.0,I just love them,"August 5, 2018",Yes,They work great. I used it for the gym and am just happy it doesn't hurt my ear and it was just a great price.,0
4.0,Great for the price,"August 13, 2017",Yes,"Not for audio snobs, but does get the job done reliably. Great battery life and comfort. Easy pairing and easy to use buttons. Decent comfort and semi noise canceling.",0

5.0,Durable and Life Long Headphones,"July 3, 2018",Yes,"Best purchase. Have 2 pairs one from 3 years ago and other from last year. Both work perfectly the older one has ware and tear and the other still looks brand new. Both batteries inside are in good shape.

1.0,Only for phone,"November 17, 2017",Yes,So apparently these only pair with phones.  I have multi Bluetooth transmitters connected to TVs and they do not pair.  Incredibly annoying that they don’t more openly advise this.  If you need headphones for anything other than listening to music on your phone I strongly suggest looking elsewhere,0
5.0,Good Purchase,"March 22, 2018",Yes,Works great.  My only complaint would be if you use the Bluetooth feature in a dark environment like an airplane.  The flashing blue light will be visable just from the corner of your eye.  So cover it up with some electrical tape or something.  It will get on other people's nerves too.  Also it does last a long time before you have to charge it.  It's a good price too.,0
5.0,Excellent!,"December 5, 2017",Yes,"Excellent!  I just bought my second one.  Fits very comfortably, sound is perfect, they don't advertise as noise canceling but probably should and they have a pretty impressive range.  For the price, you can't do better.",0

I really enjoy the feel of the over ear aspect, and the wireless bluetooth setting is great for want to talk around the house freely.

5.0,Great headphones for the price!,"November 3, 2017",Yes,"For the price, these are amazing Bluetooth headphones. My third Mpow headphone purchase, these by far are the best. Have another version of these, but the buttons were too fumbly, and just didn't like the intuitiveness of them. Although they sounded (slightly) better in the highs and mid tones, these are clear enough, great bass, are easier to use,  plus excellent Bluetooth range. Thinking about purchasing a backup pair in another color!",0
5.0,Great for those who love MUSIC!,"September 27, 2018",Yes,"Love these headphones, I use them a lot at the gym, at work, and yes even in bed!",0
4.0,Comfortable but bright and noisy,"November 8, 2017",Yes,"I have had a decade long struggle finding headphones that don’t irritate my outer cartilage piercings and earbuds that stay in my ears and don’t irritate my inner cartilage piercings. After resigning to the fact that over the ear headphones will never be compact and not bulky, I decided to try a pair. These jumped out at me for the price and shear number of reviews that gave positive marks. I skimmed through the reviews and didn’t see any glaring cons, so I decided to give these a go...For the money I really do like these:.- They sound great..- They are easy to use..- They are soft and comfortable on the head..- They do actually block out a fair bit of noise..- BIGGEST PLUS: They don’t irritate my piercings whatsoever. They cover my entire ear, industrial bar and all...In my review skimming I did miss two cons that I noticed right away:.- Yeah, they block out noise, but damn do these leak noise like crazy. I had my boyfriend wear them and listen to music on medium volume. It sounded like I was standing outside of a concert venue. I could hear the song softer than if I was wearing the headphones, but it was clear as day. We were both surprised at how much these leaked noise..- Oh my god, the flashing blue light that indicates that it’s on. In normal lighting it’s totally fine. In a dark room I can see it flashing in my peripheral vision and it drove me absolutely crazy. Not only can I see it, but it’s really bright and shines through both the LED ring and some of the seams of the plastic on the whole right side speaker. I ended up painting over the LED ring with black nail polish to try and dim the light so I could at least not see it flashing in my peripheral view. If anyone is wondering, this solution worked pretty well. Not 100%, but improvement enough where I’m not as bothered...I would give these three stars because the cons are quite big for me, but they are just so comfortable and do sound quite nice that I have to give them a little more credit.",2
4.0,"Cheap manufacturing, control button unglued and power wouldn't turn on.","November 20, 2018",Yes,"Excellent sound quality.  However very disappointed as headphone control cover just unglued, and, eve though, part was glued back it unglued again, but this time headphones stoped working, won't turn.",1

5.0,"Great Range, Great Sound, Comfortable, and Easy to Operate","August 5, 2018",Yes,"These headphones have great range and don't fail through walls. They have a nicely balanced sound for tv shows, movies, podcasts, Ted talks, audio books, metal, rock, jazz, opera, pop, rap, country, and musical theatre. They fit snugly but don't cause migraines (I will get migraines from putting my hair in a pony tail or bun wrong), they are adjustable and the adjustment stays put, the buttons are easy to ""feel"" so you can easily figure out where to push if you want to play, pause, fwd, or reverse. They fold together nicely and include a nice pouch. they are easy to charge and hold a charge well. I got the black/black and it is beautifully sleek...IN THE BOX: headphone, pouch, instructions, usb cable for charging.",2
5.0,If you feel the same way then I highly recommend buying these,"March 14, 2018",Yes,"My husband and I each wanted a set of bluetooth headphones without spending an outrageous amount of money while at the same time not spending money on a piece of $h!t. If you feel the same way then I highly recommend buying these. They are very comfortable, stylish, and the sound quality is great. They also hold a charge really well. Zero complaints after a month or two.",0
3.0,Three Stars,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"Great product, but it does not hold a charge.  Has to stay on a charger.",1

4.0,Both Bluetooth &amp; Auxiliary cable jack (male/male). Fits decent though a smidge tight.,"February 1, 2018",Yes,I haven't tried the Bluetooth yet so can not attest to its quality. The jack works fine and is plenty long for my needs. So far so good at about two weeks of daily use.,0
5.0,My entire family loves them!,"January 16, 2018",Yes,"I absolutely love these headphones.  Ordered a pair for myself so that I could listen to my class lectures in peace.  My teenager initially thought they were Beats, and wanted a pair immediately lol.. even after realizing that they were not Beats ;). I ordered a 2nd pair for him for Christmas.  They offer a great fit and sound, they're comfortable, and easy to use.  Also, the battery lasts a long time.",0
5.0,... otherwise the sound quality and ease of connecting are great.,"July 8, 2017",Yes,The headphones are a little tight but otherwise the sound quality and ease of connecting are great.,1
5.0,I like that when those headphones are on,"March 27, 2018",Yes,"I like that when those headphones are on, you can not hear anything. it works perfectly with any device as long as the bluetooth is activated. so worth the buy. I may purchase another one.",0
5.0,excellent so far,"July 3, 2017",Yes,"excellent so far, love these for what I use them for... gym work. nice bag to keep them in and everything. ill buy them again if available when im in the market",0
3.0,Inconvenient controls.,"May 8, 2018",Yes,Inconvenient and confusing controls. Too many functions in one button. Fidelity is good.,0
5.0,BEST HEADPHONES FOR A BUDGET!!!!,"August 11, 2017",Yes,"Great set of headphone! They're very comfortable and the sound is great. Don't expect to hear Beats by Dre sounds quality with these but they're definitely worth the price. If you're looking for budget headphones for a great price, these are worth buying everyday of the week.",0
5.0,Good sound for price,"September 25, 2017",Yes,Actually surprised at how good the sound is on for the price. Good heavy sounding bass but not overpowering.  Comfortable over-ear cushions. No fatigue and have used many hours. Would recommend.,0
5.0,Big bang for the buck,"April 17, 2018",Yes,The best wireless headset for the buck! You won't be disappointed. Highly recommended. I can easily see why so many people have purchased these.,0

5.0,My daughter likes them,"August 15, 2017",Yes,"So far so good, they seem durable and my daughter likes these. We tried some other kids headphones and they would fall apart. These fill strong.",0
5.0,Super Blue Tooth earphones for the price,"September 23, 2017",Yes,"Great price and pretty good fidelity. I am sure you can pay quite a bit more and get better fidelity, but most people's hearing is not good enough to appreciate the difference. Mine certainly isn't. It came quickly and as advertised.",0
5.0,Comfortable and a great price point,"October 12, 2017",Yes,"Comfortable and a great price point.  I am using them with my work laptop.  They are good at blocking out ambient noise (but these are not ""noise-cancelling"" - in case that's what you're looking for).  Note that when listening to music or other things those around you will be able to hear it too a bit, so either keep the volume way down or make sure you're listening to something that everyone likes.  :-)",0
5.0,Love these!,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"I have had these for probably over 6 months now and I still love them! I use them at the gym, running, and doing regular activities.

4.0,Virtual Teacher tool,"September 22, 2017",Yes,"Great device.  I recently became a virtual teacher, so am using them to hold virtual meetings and attending class discussions.  Very clear sound and works great.  I love not having a cord and being strapped to my desk.",0

5.0,Amazing quality for the price,"September 26, 2017",Yes,"For the price, you can't get much better than this. It doesn't really stack up to the $300 pairs but they're pretty close...and for the price is a steal.",0
4.0,"If you want better, spend more","August 17, 2018",Yes,"Not loud enough for me..Not enough bass at all..Clamps your head too much. Needed excessive stretching out...Considering the price, all can be looked over, though..What I've learned from these headphones...If you want better, spend more.",0
5.0,High definition sound at an awesome price.,"January 6, 2018",Yes,"The first order my son received was the wrong color but Amazon quickly provided a return label and within 2 days had the correct color.  Sound quality and style are both amazing.  Ears get really warm during extended listening sessions, maybe the exact headset could be made with cooler perforated leather.  Son loves them.",0
4.0,Good headphones.,"June 25, 2017",Yes,They are lightweight and comfortable. They adjust to fit and deliver good sound. You have to get a blue tooth toggle if you don't have a program already installed.,0
5.0,Very Highly Recommend,"June 17, 2017",Yes,These wireless and noise-cancelling headphones work just as well as the ones made by competitors that cost quite literally 10 times as much. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.,0

1.0,Do. Not . Buy.,"April 29, 2018",Yes,"This product is the absolute worst. The first order resulted in headphones that charged once and then stopped working. The replacement did just the same = did not work: the battery again did not hold a charge and the controls, i.e. , volume controls did not work. Have yet to receive compensation from first return mailing. Having to go thru this a 2nd time...heed my warning. Not worth it.",0
5.0,These work great for my son who has hearing sensitivity,"November 18, 2017",Yes,These work great for my son who has hearing sensitivity. The are sturdier than more expensive modeled I've purchased.,0
5.0,very good product,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"Good quiality, feels and looks high end. Real over the ear and confortables. Quick bluetooth pairing without problems.",0
4.0,LIGHT weight and WORK,"March 15, 2018",Yes,"Functional  5 stars- light weight, adjustabe-several family members were very very impressed.  It definitely improved the clarity of the T&gt;V&gt; for me.",0
1.0,Meh.,"November 9, 2017",Yes,"These seem pretty decent, comfortable on my head, light weight, and look really nice, but I can't get past the audio quality. Recognizing that these are inexpensive headphones, I'd compare the audio quality to that of a $5 set of ear buds from the checkout line at Walgreens. If you don't care about audio quality, I'd say these are a solid buy, would probably work really well for podcasts/movies, and the convenience of the bluetooth at this price point is great. But, if you're unreasonably obsessed with audio quality, you'll have to do what I did and spring for a more expensive product like Bose, Beats, or something in that vein.",3
5.0,My son ❤️ it!,"July 22, 2017",Yes,My 11years old son picked this out for himself &amp; had me pay for it of course 😀 He loves it &amp; uses it daily &amp; has stopped using his more expensive headphones!,0

5.0,Great,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"Good earphones, my parents love them.",0
4.0,Highly Recommended,"September 5, 2017",Yes,"Good sound, fits well and connects easily with bluetooth. The ear-pads get  warm after a half hour of wear but that's to be expected. They're well made and at a fantastic price for all these headphones do. I highly recommend them.",0
4.0,Would recomend,"June 20, 2018",Yes,Second set I’ve ordered.Plenty loud.Plenty comfortable.And I use them at the gym so their sweat resistant enough,0
1.0,Small and are not very loud!,"December 21, 2017",Yes,I’ve worn these twice now on a few travels and overall they are garbage...1. After wearing for over an hour my ears start hurting from the headphones. My ears are not big or anything but the pressure on my ears felt like someone was tugging on them..2. I know these are not noise canceling but I honestly could not hear hardly anything on an airplane. I sat in varies areas on a plane a few trips. I had to take them off and put my earbuds in. These will never be traveling with me again..3.  Not really a good way to understand when they are turned off..4. I guess my 6 year old nephew will enjoy them since they kind of look cool.,4
5.0,I love these earphones,"November 29, 2017",Yes,"I love these earphones. They are easy to pair to my iPhone, have great sound quality, and are the most comfortable ear fit that I have ever had.",0

4.0,Good headphones if a bit loose.,"February 28, 2018",Yes,"Good sound, good range, good controls. My only gripe is they fall off pretty easily, and I've got a large head.",0
5.0,"very good sound, super easy to connect to my phone ...","April 22, 2017",Yes,"very good sound, super easy to connect to my phone and my tablet.  Almost immediate!  So far, i'm very happy with this purchase, especially at the price point.  the head set is very comfortable also.",0
5.0,Buy these Headphones!,"January 16, 2018",Yes,Honestly I would buy these headphones 10 times over any beats branded headphones.  I've gotten countless compliments on the look and sound quality of these headphones.  The controls work great and the build quality is amazing for the price.,0
3.0,"Using with PC. No mic, only headset.","August 8, 2017",Yes,Can't get the mic's bluetooth to sync with the computer bluetooth. It only shows it as a headset with no mic. The sound is good. Comfortable as well.,0
2.0,Blutooth doesn't work properly,"September 1, 2017",Yes,"Terrible connection. It takes at least 20 tries before you get the Bluetooth to pair. Sound is decent, not outstanding, but fair for the price.",0
2.0,Less bass then my untouched backyard lake,"December 1, 2017",Yes,Bought these because the bass was supposedly good. There’s more bass when holding a cup to your ear and “playing phone” with an introvert.,0
3.0,"Good, but some issues","May 11, 2017",Yes,An overall good pair of headphones and decent sound..A couple of items that could be improved. The material used for the over ear portion is not breathable at all and does get uncomfortable..The on/off and pairing functions cause the unit to go into pairing mode when you only trying to turn the headphones off.,0
3.0,"Overall quality is good, specially the sound quality and the built","September 4, 2017",Yes,"Overall quality is good, specially the sound quality and the built. However, this is not suitable for people with big head like me; it's uncomfortable having it on for hours. The headphones extends a little but but it doesn't help that much, also the leather ear pads pillow are so mediocre small and somewhat rough, so wearing it for a period of time is a no no.",0
5.0,Awesome value for the price.,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Good looking product. No problems getting it to work. Sound quality is decent.,0
4.0,Good buy!,"August 16, 2018",Yes,Fit nicely. Lightweight. Sound good. Easy to control mechanisms.,0
5.0,works good for that,"April 16, 2017",Yes,Decent sound....fast shipping....I use it on the treadmill at the gym...works good for that.  I read people with eye glasses were having problems but I wear mine with the glasses on and no problem.,0
5.0,Excellent gift for a grandson,"November 5, 2017",Yes,I bought these headphones for my grandson’s Birthday. Today he told me that they did everything and did it really well. He was very happy saying it improved his quality of life.,0
3.0,Three Stars,"June 14, 2018",Yes,I expected better sound quality.  But I guess I shouldn't have such high expectation given the price.,0
4.0,Solid sound quality,"September 10, 2017",Yes,"Great headphones for the price. I wear these things at work and turn them way up, nobody around me seems to be able to hear any bleed through, which is nice and the sound quality is pretty solid. The only down side is that I use these for conference calls as well as music and hear complaints fairly often about my Mic cutting in and out.",0
5.0,Good Quality,"September 22, 2018",Yes,Pretty good detail.  Nice quality.  Glad I bought it.,0
4.0,Ok headphones,"March 18, 2018",Yes,I like these I have had them for several months. They seem a little big for going to the gym and they do not block out entirely outside noise but they will work.,0
5.0,Keep Charges forever!!!,"March 3, 2018",Yes,"The voice quality is very good concerning the price. Moreover, It keeps the charge FOREVER!!!.I am using it for three weeks now almost everyday for 2-3 hours and it is still halfway full!!",0
4.0,20' Bluetooth range.,"February 5, 2018",Yes,"Sound is great. Good quality, overall. No complaints yet other than my unit only works about 20 feet from my phone.",0
5.0,good quality at a bargin price,"July 19, 2017",Yes,"very inexpensive and work extremely well ,,, I use it more for gaming than music so for that purpose it works very well and it seems made well also",0
5.0,A good buy for the price,"December 14, 2017",Yes,"Audio Quality is on par with the Beats I've used. Call quality is as good as any bluetooth calling would be, no noticeable issues very comfortable a good buy for the price",0
4.0,"Good sound, good range","December 6, 2017",Yes,"Very surprised at these considering price.  Good sound, good range, instructions are written in broken English but not too bad to figure out.",0
5.0,The sound is great and the headset is extremely comfortable,"September 18, 2017",Yes,The sound is great and the headset is extremely comfortable.  The build is sturdy and the look is sleek.  It looks and feels like it should be much more expensive.  This is the first Mpow product that I bought. I also bought a 2-in-1 wireless transmitter/receiver later. I'm impressed with the quality and price of the products from Mpow so far.  I will gladly recommend either of my purchases to others.,0
5.0,Fit my ears perfectly and the sound is great. Delivered on time and well packed,"March 18, 2018",Yes,Fit my ears perfectly and the sound is great. Delivered on time and well packed. Thank you so much.,0
5.0,Very Good,"December 10, 2017",Yes,I love my headphones.  I was concerned because they weren't expensive so I didn't know what to expect. The sound is great when listening to music.  I talked on the bluetooth and my friend said that it sounded a little muffled. So that may be the only negative so far.  They are a little bigger is size than the Boze or Beats. But still very enjoyable.,0
4.0,Very great quality headphones,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"It was a gift for my sister beat, and she loves it. She is always listening to music all day every day. Very great quality headphones. Just that the headphones plug is very short...",0

5.0,Pretty great.,"September 27, 2018",Yes,"Sounds good, battery lasts figuratively forever, mic is pretty good. Only minor complaint is some minor static/noise whenever the speakers activate. Otherwise great for the price.",0
5.0,Very satisfied looking to buy another.,"August 12, 2017",Yes,I like it so much I'm considering to buy another for another room. I looked at the new version and if I buy the new version do I still have to buy the Bluetooth Strobe?,0
4.0,four,"February 23, 2018",Yes,"It only worked for two days.  I was getting ready to return it but then it started working again.  (Probably operator error).Do you sell the appropriate DC charger?  I've been having trouble finding the correct one..It's still working!  Comfortable and great sound..Thanks,.Beck",0
5.0,Great  Mpow  headphones,"July 19, 2017",Yes,This was a gift for my grandson.  He called me and said they were as good as the Boise headphones he'd seen at Costco. He.was really happy with them!,0

4.0,Good place to start,"July 15, 2018",Yes,Nice looking and comfortable noise-cancelling headphones. The Bluetooth is easy to use and the sound quality is pretty nice from what I can tell though I'm far from an expert. My main concern would be that the mic quality is lesser than desired (my friends tell me I sound like I'm under a pillow) but you get what you pay for. Overall satisfied with the purchase.,0
5.0,Great wireless headphones at a great price point!,"January 8, 2018",Yes,Great wireless headphones at a great price point! Easy to connect my phone to the speakers. Sound quality is good. Bought these for the wire-free headphone hassle at the gym when lifting weights. These headphones pack down nice.,0
1.0,Beats w/o the beat=just beets!,"June 24, 2017",Yes,"Sure they look good. They look very much like Beats, however looks can be deceiving. I found the sound quality to lack sound range-everything just got louder. No bass at all. I didn't feel the music. The Bluetooth sync is not smooth, especially jumping from one device to another. The mic for talking does not work! I gave the 1 star for style for the price. I myself value headphones sound quality over style!",7
5.0,"These headphones sound good, and are reasonably comfortable","January 23, 2018",Yes,"I resented being forced down the wireless headphone path by the pixel 2's lack of a headphone jack, but now I'm grateful. These headphones sound good, and are reasonably comfortable. The bluetooth pairing is seamless, and the value for the price is excellent.",0
3.0,"Not bad, but not great as wireless.","March 12, 2018",Yes,"They're not bad headphones, but they don't really perform well when using bluetooth.  They have a 'tinny' sort of sound via bluetooth vs. with a wire.  If you're looking to use them mostly wirelessly, I think there's better option out there.  If you're mostly going to use them connected to the device, then they'll do file.",0
5.0,I had to return a set of headphones which was quadruple the price of this one because the quality of sound was not far apart plus this one fits my ear better. I did not have any problems at all ...,"January 18, 2018",Yes,"Use it for PS4.  It's been a few months and I have to say, I am impressed by this little thing.  I had to return a set of headphones which was quadruple the price of this one because the quality of sound was not far apart plus this one fits my ear better.  I did not have any problems at all using it for hours.  I definitely recommend it.",0

5.0,"Good product, great price.","May 1, 2017",Yes,"Great build quality, intuitive controls, micro USB charging...Only downside is that they are uncomfortable to wear for more than a couple hours, but given the price, I can't fault them for that.",0
4.0,"Some pairing issues, but otherwise a good purchase.","November 1, 2017",Yes,"So far so good for the money. Bass sounds better than I expected for a ""competitively priced"" wireless headphone. Only qualm is that it won't pair with my PC. Pairing to my phone was no problem... but I wanted to use it in conjunction with my PC as well. After about an hour of struggling with oh so helpful online forums, I issued my surrender. I use them with my phone only.",0
5.0,The fact that I'm no longer tethered is fantastic and to my surprise many of my colleagues have ...,"March 12, 2018",Yes,"These are my go to now. Sound quality is a little to bassy for me but I use these for post production work at my desk. The fact that I'm no longer tethered is fantastic and to my surprise many of my colleagues have purchased  and are using them as well. For the quality and price it's tough to beat. Easy to connect, very comfortable, would recommend for the value.",0
3.0,Issues with bluetooth,"April 2, 2018",Yes,"While I'm still experimenting with various devices, these headphones seem to have problems with either connectivity or range.  Even keeping my phone in my pocket seems to be too far away for a consistent connection...These aren't bad when they work, and maybe they work better when paired to a computer, but are not useful when linked to my Samsung J7.",0
5.0,Good Product - Work Great.,"July 19, 2017",Yes,These are really cool! Not tripping over wires or having them get in the way when traveling or laying in a chair. Good sound and pairing was easy.,0

4.0,Excellent even without a manual not in box,"June 27, 2017",Yes,"So far they have been excellent.  My rating would have been a 5 if they had included a manual in the box.  Fortunately, others have created videos in you tube that provided information on how to pair them.",0
4.0,Good Budget headset,"July 2, 2018",Yes,"Not bad for $40, I don't like the way you have to navigate the on and off button, basically when you want to turn these off you have to scroll from ON to PAIRING to OFF. Other than that, it's not a bad headset for the price. I was very surprised my GF said the phone calls are very clear on her end.",0

Only complaint: the light, that flashes on the power button when on, is bright and annoying when you are listening to them while looking at your phone at night.

It's really nice that they're collapsible too. However, if you're using them for instruments the delay is INSANE.

Good sound quality; ocean noises actually sound realistic with these (which is a problem I've had with earbuds in the past.)",0

Worked so well on the plane and in the car that i had to buy another pair for my daughter so i could get mine back. You'll be very impressed with the quality of these headphones. They look every bit of the hundred dollars alternatives.,0
1.0,Cheap no brand product.,"April 28, 2018",Yes,Item doesn’t hold a charge. Either the headphones are defective or just as bad as they are cheap. Lesson learned. Will be returning them for a refund and buying a brand that actually is known and reliable.,0

5.0,Mpow Bluetooth Headphones Over Ear,"March 1, 2017",Yes,"I have used these headphones for 10 days and can say that for under $40.00 dollars these are some very good full size Bluetooth headphones...The Good:.No distortion on max volume - it’s definitely loud unless you’re very hard of hearing.  I can go into another room and it does not start losing connection until you get between 20 to 30 feet, so that is good.  Hi tones, mid ranges and low base are pretty good in my opinion.  Construction is very sturdy but if you don't treat it right you will break it.  Comfort is not bad and should fit just about anybody with a normal range size head and ears but if you do have very large ears it will be a tossup so then you will just have to try it out and if it doesn't work out send it back for a refund.  The battery life seem very good but I have not tested it till its drained completely - I charged it fully when I received it and have charged it once in the ten days that I have used it with about 2 hours a day usage.  I will not be using it for outside work since I personally think that it really is not designed for that but traveling, around the house, at the office and casual listing it would be ideal.  The headphones look really good to me but if you don't like the color red then you’re out of luck but I like it so no problem.  I have also used this headphone paired with my phone and it has a very good mic, the people I talked to said I was very clear and they were clear to me as well so that was a plus.  I have not tried it out for wired hook up but should have, then again my main purpose was Bluetooth only - I already have a nice wired headset...The Bad:.Well there is not much really at this point (10 days) but for longevity - if it last then it will be a very good headphones and if it does stop working hopefully the warranty will be honored but at $40.00 dollars it might just be cheaper to buy a new one.  If I have anything to grip about would be that it is not totally silent on the outside after the volume is up half way, now don't get me wrong it's not really load but you can start to hear what is playing on the headphones if you are sitting close to the person wearing the headphones or if it is really quite where you’re at then people will slightly hear your music especially if you have the volume cranked up.  This does not really bother me but it might bother some people...I am really happy that I purchased these Bluetooth headphones and would recommend them for purchase..Will update if things change.",1

1.0,Terrible when mic is in use.,"October 22, 2017",Yes,"They work fine as headphones, but when the mic is on or when you make a call, the audio quality becomes extremely terrible.

That's what happens when the mic is on, even if you're just listening to music on your laptop or phone and not actually talking to anyone.",4

4.0,I do like this product,"August 6, 2017",Yes,"I do like this product. I'm a little  up in the air with the time it takes to charge (which is only three to four hours) since I feel it doesn't hold charge as well as I would like. Other than that it's a great item, the headphones are easy to use. They look nice, I have a small round face and they're super chunky. The directions to use it are pretty clear and they feel nice on my face. Overall, would most likely buy this product again.",0
4.0,I like the noise canceling,"April 25, 2018",Yes,"I like the noise canceling! The bass is deep! I love the option to do Bluetooth or wired!

5.0,Beautiful sound,"August 17, 2017",Yes,"Nice looking headphones..It is comfortable to wear, and the sound is what I would expect from more expensive ones. A very pleasant surprise. I bought them for the gym, but use the headphones for movies and just listening to music.",0

4.0,Hard to get started,"April 8, 2018",Yes,"They are fine for the price.  Figuring out how to use them was a little bit confusing.  One, hard to see, button, does everything, and the directions are not clear.  The sound quality is okay.  I use them for TV, not for music.",0

5.0,Best bang for your buck,"December 28, 2017",Yes,"Of course it's not extreme quality compared to other expensive brands like Beats by Dre or any other brand, but this is a simple and great headset for use in the gym or anywhere else.

If you wanna avoid spending 100 bucks plus, grab a pair of these, you won't regret it.",0

2.0,They broke after 4 months,"June 12, 2018",Yes,So...I was waiting to write a review for these headphones once I got some time on them. I was ready to give an awesome review and then all of a sudden the sound deteriorated and the phones will not go max volume and any music plays through mono not stereo. Unfortunate because I was loving them and even recommended them to others.,0
4.0,Decent Buy,"July 20, 2017",Yes,"These headphones are decent. Their sound quality isn't the best, but they do the job. I use them for my workouts. They are bluetooth, which is convenient and they stay on my head easily which is what I was looking for. They do their job so I cannot complain.
