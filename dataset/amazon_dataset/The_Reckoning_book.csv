1.0,"Crappy, Pointless Mess","October 31, 2018",Yes,"If I were a writer and knew that I would have to give up money if I didn't have a ""book"" on my publisher's desk by a date certain, and time was up, this is the kind of load of crap I would dish up.  What passes for a plot is meaningless:  the whole book is fleshed out with WW II history that needn't be narrated as fiction, and arcane minutiae of criminal and civil procedure that couldn't be more boring and, moreover, is woefully inaccurate.  I actually felt that I'd been tricked into reading this steamer by being bamboozled by Grisham's reputation, on which I can't comment. BORING!!!!!!",132
4.0,"“The Reckoning;” Haunting - FACT, or FICTION?","October 23, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham is a fairly prolific writer who concentrates on legal matters of intrigue. “The Reckoning” is a departure, of sorts, from his customary fare. I found the opening chapter a fascinating literary technique in which Grisham peels back, layer-by-layer as though peeling an onion, certain facets of our main character. We suspect the character is either older, or the time of the story is set in a time of a few decades previous, due to the use of the term negroes, instead of blacks or African-Americans, and due to other terminology...We know also that the guy is getting set to kill somebody. We determine also that the man is a family-loving middle-class working man, depending on cotton for his way-of-life. Such character development has us begging to understand why...I mention all of the above without fear of spoilers, because it is so readily apparent so early in this latest novel by John Grisham. One of the other reviewers claims this is typical Grisham rehash, but I fervently disagree. This is a major departure from run of the mill Grisham. And I loved his technique. As to whether it is great literary writing, I will leave that judgment to others...BLUSH FACTOR: No serious worries here. Zero eff-words to worry about, and only a sprinkling of the garden variety of words not normally used in polite dinner talk. I would have no serious reservations in reading this to children or my prayer group...THE WRITING &amp; EDITING: The writing is engaging and, at its best, rips into your psyche in a subtle manner. So much so that you wonder if Grisham didn’t happen to know a war hero whom he modeled Pete Banning on. Almost as an aside, we learn that this man commits a rarity in the county. ‘A white murder,’ as opposed to lynching black folks, which is not deemed as murder. Thus, quite early we know this is going to be about a lot more than one man killing another. Hold on to your hats, because we in for a roller coaster ride here...ADVENTURE &amp; SOUL: Probably the best feature of this novel. Partly historical, partly adventure and very deep in soul of a war veteran dealing with his skeletons. I’ll say no more, for fear of spoilers...CHARACTER: It’s probably quite apparent that this is a character-driven story...EXCERPT:..This brief snippet might help more than my observations can describe:..'... She took a flood of beautiful memories of the past five years in Clanton. She took the painful farewells of a congregation that had nurtured her and her family. And, she took her husband. In the chaos after his murder, she’d agreed to have him interred in Clanton because it was simpler. However, they were not from Mississippi, had no relatives there and no real roots, and she wanted to go home. Why leave him behind? Part of her day was a trip to the cemetery to lay flowers and have a good cry, a ritual she planned to continue forever, and she couldn’t do that from Georgia. Dexter was from Rome too, so she had him reburied in a small cemetery behind a Methodist church...They had married when he was in seminary in Atlanta. Their nomadic journey began upon graduation, when he was assigned the position of associate pastor of a church in Florida. From there they zigzagged across the South, having three children with no two born in the same place, and finally got assigned to Clanton a few months before Pearl Harbor...Jackie loved Clanton until the day Dexter died, but not long after the funeral she realized she couldn’t stay. The most immediate reason was that the church wanted the parsonage. A new minister would be assigned and his family would need a place to live. The church hierarchy generously offered to provide housing for a year at no cost, but she…..Grisham, John. The Reckoning: A Novel (p. 72). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition...BOTTOM LINE..I'm tempted to rate this five stars due to the subtle ways in which Grisham gets us inside the hearts and minds of not merely the main character, but of several others. Yet, there is more that could have rounded out the story to make it the epic it truly deserves. Why? Did I forget to say that this fiction, perhaps based on fact, is Grisham’s most haunting story? To make sense of this statement, though, you’ll need to read “The Reckoning” from cover-to-cover and then think for just a bit…..Four stars out of five...I am striving to produce reviews that help you find books that you want, or avoid books that you wish to avoid.

2.0,Do not recommend!!!e,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"If you wish to spend at least 1/3 of the book getting a histoty lesson on Gen McAuthor and Japan's takeover of the Philippenes then you may enjoy the book.  I skipped over the large majority of this section.  The book also drug on and on in other parts.  I wanted to enjoy a thriller like the authors earlier books, not a sad, tedious and boring book like this one. this will be my last book by this author.",110
1.0,I will never get this time back.,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"I was really eager to read this book, and hated it.  Long long descriptive passages about mundane things. So much dramatic build up about nothing. The war parts are appreciated but the rest was a waste of time witn unsympathetic characters. Time to find a new fave author.",75
1.0,"Long winded, oais by the word","November 1, 2018",Yes,"I have always enjoyed John Grisham's novels. This one is a disappointment. First of all I did NOT like the ending at all. I know that's about me and not about the book but I still didn't like it. More than that I didn't like wasting my time thumbing through page after page after page of completely useless narrative. There is a vastly long section at the center of the book where he is writing about the mothers mental problems and the sons law school career that are a complete waste of time. It's obvious that the publishers are paying him by the page or by the word.  The result is a huge amount of unnecessary text that doesn't really contribute to the story, that is very useful in putting me to sleep. This is not the first time this is happened. I have found it happening more and more frequently with other authors.",78
1.0,too long and too detailed,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"This was a bad read.  Too much information on mostly known history.  Agree, not enough character development on some people.  Way too much detail before ""secret"" was FINALLY revealed in last 10 pages!!",88
1.0,"John, John, What Happened To You?","October 28, 2018",Yes,"This is a disjointed, dislikable book - a soap opera with some courtroom window dressing and the Bataan Death March thrown in for no apparent reason except alleged depth of feeling. The mystery of the main character is that he won't talk - a sort of misguided Clint Eastwood Man With No Name anti-hero. Not talking can work on the screen but does tend to drag on on the page. The wife does a bad thing while her husband is slogging around in the Philippines, although it isn't clear what that is until the end. Consequences ensue. The hero kills somebody else. The generations-old family farm is lost to a shyster lawyer. Almost everybody dies. Who knew what? When did they know it? Who was wrong? In the end, who cares? I can't believe I read the whole thing.",65
5.0,The Bataan Death March,"October 25, 2018",Yes,"I read all of Mr. Grisham's novels and look forward to each release with anticipation.  But none before have held my interest as much as The Reckoning.  My uncle through marriage is a survivor of the Bataan Death March.  He never spoke of his experiences.  Not a history buff, I had no understanding of the atrocaties  of this war.  This novel was spellbinding from start to finish.",82
2.0,Disapointed,"October 27, 2018",Yes,A lot of long arduous filler to finally reveal nothing of surprise.  Dont believe the hype.  This is not his best work.  I feel more like the victim of a con job than a satisfied fan.,46
1.0,So NOT Grisham !!!!!,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"I have been a big fan and have read EVERY Grisham novel. This is just bad.  The story arc is so lacking in credibility.  How could Pete who suffered through what he did end up killing another for ""sins"" committed when he was presumed dead ? What allowed him to survive the atrocities of war would have allowed his mind to deal with an infidelity another way-- I think--- just did not ring true for me. The narrative was also lacking in tension-- very boring in fact, but I plowed through it.  I think Mr Grisham is definitely past his prime or just being lazy.  What a waste of printed paper!",37
3.0,Not my favorite Grisham book,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"I've read all of John Grisham's books and this is the only one that I just didn't like. The main plot was interesting but the middle section (the main character's wartime experiences in the Philippines) was way too long and I kept wondering why it was necessary to the story. The ending did tie the story together, but, by the time I got there, I was just glad the book was done. Will go back and reread several of my favorites but this one won't be on that list.",33
2.0,Not Worth My Time To Read: Will be donated immediately,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"This is not a typical John Grisham story. It is very tragic and examines the cultural and psychological aspects of poor communication and perhaps the effects of PTSD in WW2 vets. There’s no happy ending here. The main character is built so that I felt empathy for him, however he brought so much destruction to so many people it is almost impossible to feel any real sympathy for him. The lesson here for me is that actions produce consequences that effect more people than you might imagine. Also communicating well is much more important than actions.",38
1.0,Awful! Worst Grisham Book Ever!,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"Horrible, 400 page LONG and drawn out story. Could have been based on a ten page short story by a freshman in community college. Mr Grisham, please bring back your inventive legal thrillers. Severely disappointed.",23
3.0,Another long march to an unsatisfied ending,"October 27, 2018",No,"I love the thought of John Grisham and his rich Southern characters and the beginning of his books with the anticipation of a very good story.  Then it plods along and instead of developing characters and story it just dies a slow death with an ending that is abrupt or just boring.  I vowed not to read him again after The Confession which just made me mad that I wasted my time.  Obviously, I gave him another chance.. No spoiler alert except to tell readers, yes, you do finally find out the motive but by the time you get to it,  you know nothing could be as bad to justify all the suffering it caused. The best part of the book was the description of the Bataan Death March which was richly woven and worth the read... thus the 3 stars.",44
1.0,Boooring and very tedious,"October 23, 2018",Yes,"This is as depressing a tale as Grisham has ever told.  It all revolves around Pete Banning, heir to a large farm in Mississippi that's been in the family for centuries.  Pete has what's considered a nice life until he joins the war and ends up in a POW camp being tortured for two years.  During that time they break his legs which heal improperly and he endures years of pain.  When he finally escapes and is transported back to the US he has to have his legs broken again to heal them properly.  After months of surgeries and therapies he's so excited to finally be healed enough to have sex wit his wife Liza.  Only she's not interested.  So like any man he gets suspicious.  She tells him a story, that she was pregnant when he left and miscarried.  Since she had three miscarriages before it's believable, but the timing is off.  Pete had a back injury which prevented them from having sex, so her lies start to pile up.  Pete hires a private detective who discovers she made secrets visits to the pastor Dexter Bell.  So he confronts Liza and asks her if she had an affair with Pastor Bell.  She says she did, that she was pregnant with his child, and that the abortion she had caused her to have an infection which made her lose feeling, made her completely lose interest in sex.  Which was a lie.  But he believed her.  She has a nervous breakdown and he commits her to a hospital for care.  But the knowledge that his wife had an affair the two years he was being tortured drives him crazy and he kills Pastor Bell, an innocent man.  Pete is convicted of the murder and executed.  He makes no attempt to defend himself.  Over the next two-three years his two children will fight to keep the farm land that's been in the Banning family for centuries...and they'll lose.  Their mother eventually escapes the hospital and kills herself, but not before telling her secret.  It wasn't Pastor Bell, but the African American grandson of their servants she had the affair with.  Pastor Bell was completely innocent.  He convinced her not to tell anyone about the young man she was being intimate with because in those days he would've been hunted down and hanged.  So what we have here is a woman who lied to save one man and unwittingly condemned another innocent one...As tragic as this story is, it's told in the last four pages of the novel, starting on page 413 of the 417 page novel.  :0.The first 412 pages are incredibly boring.  Most of the middle 200 pages is Pete's view of the war told in narrative with little dialogue.  Most of the last 150 pages are a narrative of the various briefs and courts the lawsuit for the land goes through, more boring...Needless to say this was a very disappointing read.  Won't be picking up another Grisham novel.  ""The Brethren"" was probably his most ingenious plot and I laughed through most of it.  That was the only reason I picked this up.",30
1.0,Very Depressing,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"Wow, Grisham must be really morose.  This book is certain to make the reader dislike humanity.  Long draw out detailed descriptions of POW inhumane treatment, vivid description of electrocution, scoundrels,  liars,  cheaters, cold unfeeling people and misfortunes.  Add to that Grisham's trademark - long drawn out boring court proceedings and legal shenanigans..I had to keep pushing myself to read in hope that there would be some salvation but no joy.  Just a bad ending.",20
1.0,Misrepresented,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"This book was misrepresented.  I would never have bought a book about the Bataan death march.  I had a friend who walked that walk. The whole plot was dumb. The first third was ok.  The second third was for readers who enjoy reading war stories. The third part was a dragged out romance.  The ending lacked something, I don't know what. This book is the last, Mr. Gresham, you have lost a fan.  Amazon, I want my money put back in my gift certificate.",18
3.0,Not up to his usual standards,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"I love John Grisham books and was anxious to read his latest work.  The characters are nicely drawn andyou are pulled into the story and want to keep reading to see how it turns out.  Because it’s John Grisham, you expect some kind of twist or unique reveal that will be the payout for investing so heavily in his characters and their dilemmas.  Unfortunately the book is predictable and leaves you disappointed.  The big secret turns out to be what you expected all along and you feel that it doesn’t ring true to the noble-ness of the main character.  In the end you are left with some enjoyment but not the kind of satisfaction that would make you recommend the book to everyone you know who loves to read.",15
5.0,Grisham. Read &amp; Enjoy,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"A masterful plot construct of “What” followed by “Why” flavored with just a sprinkle of very dark WWII history. At first, I did wonder “Where is this going?” As usual, it led to a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience. Grisham’s characters are so wonderfully created and so believable that empathy is instant. No superheroes. No blatant improbability. Just a very complex journey of the vagaries of life set in the rural south during the ‘40s.",32
1.0,A terrible read. I hated this book.  Quite boring and terrible ending.,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I have read every John Grisham Novel and this by far the worst.  Spends a great deal of time developing characters that seem to serve no purpose, and book seems to drag on.  This is just a horrible way to treat an honored war veteran that sacrificed so much.  I wished I had never read this book.  Jonh Grisham must thoroughly hate America's war veterans and heroes to think up such a tragic story.  I will make sure I wait after he publishes his next book until the book is thoroughly vetted before purchasing it.  I bought this one pre-release - what a mistake.",16
2.0,Trading on name,"October 28, 2018",Yes,Well written pablum set in WW2. Ending clear from 4th chapter. So disappointing.,25
1.0,"Think adding the ""stuff"" regarding experiences in the WW II was superfluous, not one of my favorites by Gresham. Book dragged on with a fragmented plot. Would not recommend","October 28, 2018",Yes,"Think adding the ""stuff"" regarding experiences in the WW II was superfluous, not one of my favorites by Gresham. Book dragged on with a fragmented plot. Would not recommend .",15
1.0,"Boring, boring, boring","October 29, 2018",Yes,This is agonizing reading but I will not quit.  I should have read reviews before ordering the audible and Kindle versions.  What a waste of money.,15
1.0,and on and on,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"early in the book grisham is recounting the son reflecting on his childhood . it got so tiresome that grisham himself ended the segment by saying ""and on and on""  . and that should be the title of this book  . at best a harlequin short story  . 5% story and 95% filler that went on and on and on  . what a waste !!!!!!",12
5.0,Reckoning,"October 31, 2018",Yes,This is a great book by an equally great author.  Having read many of his books the first section was as expected.  I did not expect a section with the depth of detail about Pete's war experiences.  The third section was even more diverting and I couldn't put the book down.  I am a long time John Grisham fan and this book is at a new level.  For anyone that may have any doubts all I can say is you won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend this for avid fans and as a great introduction to John Grsham's books.,9
2.0,If you are looking for a page turner this isn't it.,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I really wanted to like this book but after the first section it spiraled downward.  What a tedious and boring read...The Reckoning is written in three sections.  The first section is about the murder for no apparent reason of a well-liked local preacher by the main character, Pete,  a well-respected Clanton, Mississippi war hero .  This takes place in 1947.  The first section is intriguing and leaves the reader with the hopes of a well-written page turner...Unfortunately, the second section of the book which was about  the Bataan Death March on the Philippines and also guerilla warfare there was tedious and boring to read.  A third of the book was about this.  It didn't help matters that I had already read an historical account of the march and also a novel about the march.  Eventually, I began skimming these chapters.  I haven't figured out why this entire section had much to do with the first section of the novel nor did it seem to have anything to do with the third section and the culmination of the story...The third section of the book tries to wrap up the story and explain why Pete did what he did in the first section but it certainly didn't hold much credence to why he would have done what he did.  Also, there was a side story about Pete's son, Joel, and a new love of his life which seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with the overall plot...The only reason I gave this book a two star rating is that I really could feel the flavor with the writing of post WWII era in Clanton ...The only thing I can figure out is that Mr. Grisham was trying to tell a story that leant itself to the time period of post WWII south in Mississippi and the culture during that time period.  Unfortunately, it was a very boring story.",6
3.0,Mixed feelings,"October 23, 2018",Yes,"This book started out strong. Pete Banning, a respected farmer and war hero, kills his minister without a word of explanation. Banning flatly refuses to reveal his motive or participate in his own defense, and part one of the book focuses on the crime and its aftermath. I read straight through without a break, invested in the characters and drawn into the mystery..Part two almost felt like a different book. It was a flashback section focused on Banning's harrowing experiences during World War II. It included long sections of exposition and history, and while it was interesting, it also felt overly long and a little disconnected..Part three returned to the main story line, primarily concentrating on Banning's family and the difficulties they faced after his trial. I felt more connected to the story than I was in part two, but the pacing was slow and the conflicts not nearly as gripping. In the last few pages, the book offers a very quick resolution that was something of a letdown..Overall, The Reckoning was a worthwhile way to spend an evening, but not something I plan to reread.",8
1.0,BEWARE of SPOILERS in the Customer Reviews.,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"I really hated this book.  I skipped over most of it.  I won't go into why, since another customer review gives away the whole thing.",9
3.0,Disappointing,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"I really have enjoyed John Grisham’s books and eagerly awaited the release of The Reckoning. The part of the book about the Bataan Death March was captivating but that was about it. You knew the family was a mess from the beginning so no surprise it ended up that way. The characters, other than Pete were one dimensional and never really developed. What I did like about the book is it gave a telling and accurate portrayal of life on a southern cotton farm in the early part of the 20th century and the relationships between the whites and blacks. The ending, rather than explosive, was a big puff of smoke. A huge disappointment.",11
5.0,Three great novel which have three great stories,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I started reading the book and found myself totally unable to take a break while reading it. The novel included excellent and informative fiction which include the South in the forties, WW II action in the Philippines and a murder mystery with a surprise outcome. I highly recommend taking the time to read this great novel.",8
5.0,Fascinating Historical Facts,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Reckoning. And although I had figured out the plot early on, I was shocked by the fate of one of the main characters.  Also fascinating was the author's description of the Bataan Death March during World War II. I'm a history buff and had relatives who had served in that war, ones of who came back with shell shock, known as PTSD today. So this explained a lot for me about his condition.",9
3.0,Not Up To Grisham's Usual High Standards,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham is one of my favorite authors--I have read all of his books.  The Reckoning is, for me, a disappointment.  It is comprised of Parts I, II and III.  In Parts I and II, he wanders around verbosely, taking us outside of his normally well scripted and well plotted grooves, even to a way-too-long Bataan Death March, apparently trying to re-create William Faulkner (who appears in Part III).  He gives us the ""secret"" at the end of Part III, leaving, at least me, feeling manipulated and undernourished.  I have a theory about this one.  Like James Patterson, I suggest that Grisham is running out of energy to turn out continuously well written best sellers, so he took on ghost writers who actually wrote these words (they certainly don't have Grisham's usual focus and effective ness), but did not give them credit, as Patterson graciously does.  The result: a John Grisham book which is so-so, boring in way too many places and for way too long, and which is not up to his high standards, his long history, and what he has produced in his long list of best seller books.  C'mon John, get back up there and give us your best.",5
1.0,Not convinced Grisham even wrote this book,"November 10, 2018",Yes,I have read every book this author has published. He is one of my favorites and I looked forward to this new book. Unfortunately it was terrible. I could not get into the story which dragged from the very beginning. The story is disjointed and the characters are shallow and not believable. You will be able to figure out the ending pretty much as soon as the crime occurs. I did - and I skipped the middle third of the book just to get to the end. My opinion is that someone other than Grisham wrote this book and slapped his name on it to meet some contract requirement. Very disappointing and wish I could get my money back. No more pre-ordering this author. I will wait until the book comes out and I see the reviews.,6
1.0,Grisham has lost it,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"That's the last timeI read a Grisham book before seeing the reviews. A tiny so-so plot that drags and drags.  I started skimming after page seventy, and jumped over large portions to get to the end. No happy ending! All went down the tubes. I have read every book Grishan ever wrote, some of them three times. The man has lost it. Adios, John.",7
3.0,The Reckoning,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"I read several Grisham novels early in his career, quit for several years, then tried to get through The Rooster Bar.  I quit reading about halfway through, partly because I didn't care for any of the main characters.  I thought I'd try his latest, The Reckoning, mainly because it takes place in Ford County, where A Time To Kill was set.  I made it to the end, but found only the section concerning WWII really interesting.  There was no doubt you would learn why certain things happened at the book's end, but the story seemed so disjointed, and the characters all pretty one-dimensional, I didn't really care.  These two latest Grisham books weren't up to the standard of his earlier works.",5
1.0,Discouraging,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"The author is an amazing wordsmith, but I did not like this novel..I know the Bataan Death March is important to history, but I could not stand to read all the horrors in the many pages devoted to it..I also gave up reading all the thousand of words describing the miserable legal misfortunes of the main character's family..I have always loved the author's works, but not this one..Definitely not!",6
1.0,Where is the real John Grisham?,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"Closed the cover on my last John Grisham book.  This was not suspenseful but more like trying to walk through quicksand.  If the author wanted to write a book about the Bataan Death March and WWII events he should have done so.  I always give any author a chance to engage me but this one started strong and quickly moved on to many issues that were not, in any way, relevant to the story.  Grisham has always been a great author but his ""glory days"" seem to have passed",6
2.0,"Should have been titled ""Dig a Little Deeper""","October 28, 2018",Yes,"Book droned on and on, did not like any of the characters Pete the killer/husband of Liza the adultress, or their children Stella and Joel.  The book took too long to tell the age old story of pure as the driven snow  white woman has sex with black man and either cries rape or blames an innocent once she's found out.  Instead of black man being lynched, husband kills alleged lover.  OMG it went on and on so much so that I skipped to the very rushed and unsatisfying ending.  I have never read John Grisham before and thought this would be a good book to get a feel for how I might enjoy his other novels.  Not gonna happen.",11
2.0,Might be his weakest novel,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"I finished this book.  I'll give myself credit for that, and John too for his past efforts that convinced me to.  But what the heck was the point of any of this?  Has he ever written a less likable or sympathetic protag than Pete Banning?  Pete, and it's not spoiling to say this I don't think since it's on the cover leaf, shoots and kills the local pastor......for reasons he stubbornly and stupidly refuses to divulge.  To anyone.  The rest of the novel is half aftermath to the shooting, and half flashback to his war days (the novel begins in 1946)...Is it ironic that while the flashback stuff smacks as filler, it's far more interesting than the events of the shooting and onward?  That was the part of the story that grabbed me, and it was really well told.  Had nothing to do with the shooting of course, but it was riveting at times...That said, the only suspense in the story was wondering ""It has to get better, right?  It's John Grisham.""  It's been years since I knew even the basic plot of John's novels ahead of time.  I just get them on day one and start reading, letting myself be surprised.  Not sure if I'll do that next October.  I'm sure I'll buy it, one clunker among 40 is still a great rate of success.  But this was weak.  Two stars because I finished it, and for all the times the books weren't weak.",3
3.0,Very Depressing,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I own every Grisham book ever written.  But this may be my last one.  Here are the reasons:  1) we all know he’s anti-capital punishment, that’s fine, but enough of sickening tales how it has been abused.  2) this book was depressing in almost every way.  Yes, I was born in 1946, and grew up in Texas in the ‘50s, so I know bad things went on.  But we need to move beyond that and look for good in one another, in order to avoid prolonged hatred.  3) I want to read about how people overcame human misery, not prolong it.  I’m sorry, he’s a great author but this sinks too low for my taste.",5
2.0,Way too long,"October 25, 2018",Yes,"The bulk of this novel is taken up in the middle with war stories. I ended up skipping it because it was so long and tedious, and because I already knew what happened to the main character in the war from reading the first fourth of the book. This whole novel was just so predictable. Grisham is one of my favorite writers, but this one was such a disappointment.",6
1.0,Money Grab by author,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"In reading the first half of the book I had some interest in the story line, reaching the second part it more or less seemed that the story was not coming together as planned and Mr. Grisham  then-reached for his history book and  proceeded to give us a history lesson. Many of us had read of this in History classes in High School. It appears he must have been attempting to rush a novel, that he was contractually obligated to by his Publisher...The whole novel/fiction/history, I found disingenuous. Save your money and effort,refuse to be taken for a fool.",4
1.0,As bad as A Painted House,"October 24, 2018",Yes,"How can a writer of Mr Grisham’s ability put together such a load of absolute rubbish. I really cannot believe I suffered through that boring , depressing and badly written piece of crap. Mr Grisham most readers enjoy something uplifting at some time in a book, my opinion is this is by far your worst effort ever, abysmal is the best way to describe your characters and pathetic is for the story. I thought A Painted House was ordinary and Rooster Bar was the start of your decline but to put your distinguished name to this latest drivel is surprising.",5
5.0,A great tragedy written by an excellent author,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"I read the disappointment from some readers that this book isn't like ""The Firm"", or one of the previous great ""legal thriller's"" Grisham has written.  If that's only what Grisham's work is to you, then go re-read ""The Firm"".  It's still a great read the 2nd time..Grisham is an expert at depicting the conflicting ways of the South's ethics, politics, ethnic differences, and especially in small, deep southern towns, way beyond just another southern legal battle's point of view.  This book is a TRAGEDY, staged in small-town Mississippi immediately following WW II, and really shows the moral and ethical torments and mental decisions made by those living that life and by those rules around them, as decided by that society, and those life-changing decisions expertly described and expressed from several points of view.  The war hero, his wife, sister, kids and his family's century-long ties with loyal black servants.  His up-bringing and that up-bringing's effect on so many decisions and consequences..I found it so much more than just another well written legal thriller, and told by one of the best of America's authors.",5
2.0,Flop,"November 1, 2018",Yes,Not the best Grisham has written. If I could demand a refund I would. I regret wasting my time finishing it.,7
1.0,Very Disappointed,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"Let me start by saying, I love John Grisham’s books.  All are good, some are great.  This book was terrible.  Although the writing itself was good, the story line was slow and boring.  I picked up the book and gave up on reading it three times.  I finally forced myself to finish it and skipped through most of the middle part of the book.  If I wanted to read a book about war, I’d buy something else.  In the end, I was glad to finally know what the motive was, but disappointed it wasn’t more clever.  Usually, Grisham’s books weave an elaborate tale that takes you on a glorious ride, with one or two great surprises.  Not this one, it was dull and plodding.  Sorry John, I hope your next book is better.",3
1.0,Obviously a quick write,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"For this review, Amazon is requiring at least 20 words and I believe that the author was given a similar requirement for this book to get published..For the lot of all this paper and ink, all boiled down might make a tolerable short story. Maybe.",5
1.0,Unfavorable,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"I have long been a fan of Mr. Grisham having read every book he has written. To say I was extremely disappointed in ""The Reckoning: A Novel"" would be a massive understatement. The book reads as if it is a history lesson with very little of an authors' sense of storytelling. In the ""Author's Notes"" Mr. Grisham admits that he ""...stole this story.""..Having wasted $14.95 and several hours of my time it is my opinion that Mr. Grisham should retire from ""writing"" novels. Free his assistants from the mundane task of historical research and allow them to better prosper on their own...Enough said - time to move on to something much more productive.",4
1.0,Don't Waste Your time and money,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"Grisham has written an awful book. Without revealing the plot, I cannot give many details. Suffice it to say that if you are fascinated by death row appeals with no foundation, The Bataan Death March, and the rampant racism of The South post WWII, then this is your book. Otherwise, forget it. I believe I have read every one of his books. The last being ""The Rooster Bar"" which was an intriguing tale and well written. ""The Reckoning"" is light years off the author's successful course of the last 20 years. I wish I had my time back, never mind the money.",3
1.0,Not for me,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"I was so very excited to get Grisham's newest book - what a disappointment!  I choose his books for the characters and story lines.  While the main character is well written, I seriously have no interest in one-third of the book's history lesson on his war experiences.  I will be checking out Grisham's next book from my public library.",4
4.0,Mayhem in Mississippi,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"It’s October 1946 in Clanton, Mississippi.  Our protagonist, Pete Bannon, has eaten breakfast and is heading out to see the preacher, Reverend Dexter Bell.  Pete’s children, Joel and Stella are away in college and his wife, Liza, has been tucked away in a mental institution.  Pete finds the preacher, calmly murders him with his pistol, and is arrested without any resistance.  He is quickly brought to trial and, to his attorney’s amazement, will not plead any defense.  About this time I thought we’d have a trial full of legal maneuvers and Grisham’s fireworks but I was wrong.  Pete is convicted of murder and receives the ultimate sentence.  The one thing missing is motive but Pete will never reveal why he killed Dexter Bell.. All of the foregoing is just the first one third of the book.  Part two harks back to 1925 when Pete is a recent graduate of West Point and meets Liza in Memphis.  They soon get married, have their two children, and settle into civilian life on their large Clanton farm.  But when war arrives in 1941, Pete is recalled to active duty.  He eventually finds himself in the Philippines when his parent unit surrenders to the Japanese and he is one of the many unfortunates in the Bataan death march.  I’ve read other reports of the atrocities committed by the Japanese on this march and Grisham’s prose is both detailed and inspiring.  Pete later escapes from a POW camp and joins other Americans and Fillipinos for many exciting guerrilla actions.  Pete and his cohorts are finally rescued by American soldiers when Douglas MacArthur fulfills his promise to return.  After reading this second part, I wondered what all this contributed to Pete’s story and motivation when he returned to Clanton.. Part three, the final section of this book, jumps forward in time but starts with the aftermath of Pete’s trial for the murder of Reverend Bell.  Another legal action begins with Reverend Bell’s widow suing Joel and Stella for damages caused by the wrongful death of her husband.  Joel is a student in law school and helps the family’s attorney at the trial but the verdict is another terrible event in the lives of Joel, Stella, and their mother Liza.. So, why did Pete murder Reverend Bell?  There is a “reveal” at the book’s end, something that I would have never guessed in a hundred years.  The other feature of this book which puzzled me was its structure.  Why did the narrative bounce back and forth in time instead of being presented on a straight time line?",2
5.0,Just seeing the number of reviews tells you something,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham has been a mainstay of American fiction for a long time now, and like all authors with impressive catalogs he has had some slightly disappointing books, good, and shows here with ""The Reckoning"" that he can still one out of the park..  But as a cautionary warning, this is NOT the feel good book of the year.  Perhaps it's best going in to know that the portion of the novel that takes place in Mississippi is supposedly a true story as Grisham states, and a woefully sad one at that.  Obviously the characters and plot embellishment are necessary, but it does make the reader feel how the mentality of post-WWII northern Mississippians felt in many respects of a hard living..  The portion of the book that is more important is his telling the story of the atrocities committed by the Japanese during their occupation of the Philippines most infamously in the Bataan death march and unbelievably wretched conditions at Camp O'Donnell, where the captured men were kept, some to languish and die, some to be exported to Japan itself as slave labor in its coal mines.  Grisham gets the accounts exactly right, and it is to his credit he uses his popularity to share this horrific episode in American military history, lest anybody ever forget the supreme sacrifices our WWII veterans made to keep us free.  The main character and a buddy or two are fictional, but everything else is sadly and horribly true, including the cowardice of Douglas MacArthur, who failed on many fronts to serve those soldiers under his command, including refusing to send warehouses full of foodstuffs, medicine and other essential materials along with his troops.  His cowardice was outmatched by his ego, as he brazenly strode ashore like a conquering hero well after the battle had been lost and only when American reinforcements arrived and secured the island archipelago.  Why this man was and is treated like an American hero is baffling.  He was in favor of nuclear annihilation of northeast China and North Korea during the Korean War and sufficiently alarmed Harry S Truman into removing him and replacing him with Mark Clark, a much more stable general to take over..  That said, Grisham weaves the two scenarios into a frankly depressing book, but captivating and emotionally charged one just the same.  Even with this knowledge, it's a great read, important to remind us of Bataan, and to have an intimate look into the lives of men who saw, experienced and survived humanity at its most evil and came home to quickly establish the US as the greatest nation on earth for at least a couple of decades.  When John Grisham is on, he's on, and ""The Reckoning"" is one of the best novels he's written.",3
5.0,A powerful historical novel as well as a gripping legal thriller,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham is well known around the world as an author of popular courtroom dramas and other legal thrillers. Now, in 2018, he has ventured into new territory with an extraordinary historical novel. Although some of the action takes place in the courtroom, the central elements of the story are a shocking murder, the dynamics of a well-to-do Mississippi family, and the horrific experience of American soldiers forced into the Bataan Death March...In The Reckoning, the action unfolds over an eight-year period in the 1940s. Grisham tells the backstory in flashbacks that begin in 1925. War overshadows the events in both periods. The central character is Pete Banning, a West Point graduate. Banning joined the US Army as a lieutenant in 1925, left to take over the family cotton farm during the Depression, and returned to the service in 1942. His experiences in the Philippines during World War II dominate the story...From the Bataan Death March to murder in Mississippi.Banning's cold-blooded murder of his hometown preacher in 1946 is the hinge on which the tale turns. Clearly, his wartime experiences on the Bataan Death March and later as a guerrilla fighter with the Philippine Resistance help to explain why he committed murder so soon after returning home. But his attorney is unable to enter any evidence of those experiences into the record, since Banning resolutely refuses to explain why he did what he did and will not cooperate in his defense...John Grisham becomes deadly serious in an excellent WWII novel.Grisham's popularity rests largely on his ability to write entertaining stories. They can be deadly serious at times, exposing corporate greed, judicial misconduct, or corruption of other sorts. But his books are breezily written, suspenseful from beginning to end, and generally shy away from lurid displays of violence. The Reckoning departs from this pattern, and it couldn't be otherwise. The Bataan Death March is one of the most horrific examples of sadistic cruelty and wanton murder to emerge from the Second World War. Grisham has researched the topic well, and it shows...About the author.John Grisham has written 39 novels since 1989. (Yes, that's more than one per year. And that doesn't include his many short stories and articles and the numerous films and television adaptations on which he no doubt played a role.) As is well known, Grisham is an attorney and is an advocate of prison and legal reform. He lives with his family in Oxford, Mississippi, a city that is featured in The Reckoning, his latest work.",3
4.0,An Unfortunate Departure for John Grisham,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"I have read every adult John Grisham novel since ""A Time to Kill"" and reviewed many on Amazon. I am at a loss to understand why Grisham published this book. My reaction is not due to the very minor amount of legal elements in the story, because Grisham has developed into a fine novelist over the last several decades.  In addition to being gripping stories (or ""page turners"" as I call them), recently he has used them to educate his readers about different facets of the legal system, from mass tort lawyers to public interest lawyers to lawyers who oversee judges. And in fact each of the three capsules of the story is well written. What does bother me is the intense focus on violence and shocking human degradation, the absence of any page-turning suspense, and the fact that the three sections of the story don't fit together smoothly...The first section of the story is set in Mississippi 1946 and focuses upon the central character in the novel, cotton farmer Peter Banning freshly returned from being a pow and guerilla fighter against the Japanese invaders of the Philippines.  Many had thought him dead during the several years of his absence, so he returns a hero. A West Pointer and upstanding citizen of the cotton-growing community, Pete one day walks into the local church and pumps three bullets into a local minister. He does not deny his crime, or even authorize any defense in court, and most puzzling he does not offer any explanation for his bizarre act. As a result, in this capital murder case, he suffers the ultimate penalty, leaving behind his wife and two teen age children. I though this skillful section kicked off the book nicely...My problems began with the middle section, which actually takes place prior to the first section, after Pete has rejoined the army and been sent to fight in the Philippines in 1941. After some initial fighting with Japanese troops, Pete is captured and launched into the infamous Bataan Death March. True to history, the Japanese soldiers treat the Americans during the long march to a prison in the most cruel and inhumane ways one can imagine--for about 100 pages, over and over again. Why is it necessary to go into the most intimate gory details repeatedly?--it turns the reader's stomach. Once again I do not criticize the author's substantial skills in capturing these horrid details, I only wonder why about 1/3 of the novel has to be devoted to this inhuman spectacle. The section also recounts Pete joining up with a guerilla organization and killing many Japanese troops, while suffering severe injuries himself. Yet more violence...The final section jumps back to 1946-49 andcovers the mess for his family resulting from the murder.  The victim's family files a wrongful death action against Pete and his estate, and they seem determined to grab the family's farm land, home and other assets if they are victorious. Here we have a bit of legal activities, and nobody can handle this kind of material like Grisham, but there is little suspense or excitement since the case is open and shut. What does emerge as the finest writing in the book is the turmoil undergone by Pete's wife who is resident in an insane asylum, his sister who is in bad health, and the stress on his children trying to finish college without a mother or father. And in true Grisham fashion, we have a surprise ending and in fact do learn why he killed the minister...Grisham has already proved beyond refutation that he has become a fine novelist who can shape dialogue and plot skillfully to tell remarkable stories. He does not have to write about Bataan, bloody guerilla operations, a family's sorrow, or other non-legal subjects  to demonstrate his versatility. On the other hand, he has developed by facing new challenges and perhaps this book was undertaken in that spirit. In any regard, Grisham is always worth reading--even here.",1
1.0,What a waste of time!,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"I generally look forward to Grisham's books but I have to say, I really wish I read some of the reviews here before I ordered.  Not only do I agree with most of the negative reviews, I have to say that this is one of the first times I finished a book with the words ""thank God that's done!""..First off, the book is extremely disjointed.  It starts out well as one of Grisham's crime and trial novels, but then it deviates into chapter after chapter of WWII history of the Bataan Death March.  While this was a great tragedy in American history, it really added nothing to how this book started out nor, especially, how it ended.  Characters introduced had little to do with the actual plot (wait - was there a plot or was it many plots?) and I found myself going back and forth trying to understand their relationship to what I thought was the original story.  Suffice to say that this was a taxing book that was a chore to read but I shouldered on hoping that it would come back to something sensible..Nope!..Apparently the author forgot that he had a book deadline and decided to ""pool"" research in many plot lines and toss them into one.  It's a bunch of hours that I'll never get back, and coming off the ""Rooster Bar"" and ""Camino Island"", I was looking forward to this.  It was a huge waste of time and money.",2
1.0,A lot of unconnected fluff and a very disappointing explanation for the key character's behavior,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"I have expected complex novels from John Grisham, with twists and unexpected turns.  This was simply boring and formulaic. I was very disappointed that I slogged through the boring sections I and II, until the last 4 or 5 pages in Section III revealed the incident that drove the destructive behavior if the two main characters.  Even taking into account the strong racial inequities of the 1950's, the incident that caused the destruction of 2 families was disappointingly trivial.",5
1.0,What happened to John Grisham?,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I have been a faithful fan of John Grisham since book 1. Never any doubt. Just buy the book the day it comes out. Boy, I will never do that again. I will wait and read reviews before purchasing any more of his books. The Reckoning left much on the table for me. I made it through the first third just okay, not really into it the way I have been with his other books. But from then on I just couldn't wait to get through the book. I had to make myself read the entire book. The middle section of the book is a rewrite of events from WWII. Not being a war buff, I did not enjoy that portion of the book at all. Then the last third came and went with no real ""ah ha"" moment. It just didn't come together for me. I hope Mr. Grisham goes back to his roots. That's what has brought him this far.",2
1.0,Would have made a good short story,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"I have read all of Grisham's books and I have to say that this one was a disappointment.  The beginning legal premise was interesting, but soon went nowhere because the storyline didn't have much meat on its bones.  There  just wasn't much substance to work with since Banning would not speak.  The middle of the book was a history lesson about the American soldiers' mistreatment at the hands of the Japanese during WWII in the South Pacific.  This was a rewrite of history, and other than the characters inserted into it, there was no fiction involved.  The information on MacArthur was interesting.  So much for him being a hero of the war.  The final section of the book again dealt with little in the way of legal issues and the resolution of the story as well as the ending was abrupt.  Too bad Grisham couldn't have  expanded on this section...I have been trying to decide if Grisham was attempting to be more literary in this work, or simply tired of the formula of his more successful books.  Who knows?  Everyone needs a change of pace, but this did not succeed in holding my interest very well...This piece should have been condensed and then would have made a good short story or novella.  If Grisham, like many authors, has a pile of ideas that could not be successful in a book-long format, maybe he should concentrate on developing some of them into a short story collection.",1
2.0,Good start then 300 pages of fluff,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"This book contains three distinctly different books.  In the first, there is a mystery about why the murder was done.  The writing is clever - the plot moves along but the motive remains uncertain.  The second part of over 100 pages is a narrative about Pete Banning's wartime exploits.  It adds nothing to the underlying plot and I skipped ahead many times to get through it sooner.  In the third section we have to suffer through endless trials with predetermined verdicts and the romantic exploits of Pete's son which have nothing to do with the main plotline.  Finally we find out the 'secret' in the last 4 pages of the book.  Too bad you have to plough through over 400 pages to get there - it's not that fascinating.",2
2.0,Who wrote this Book ?????,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"I am a big Grisham fan - read every book, and like all of his other fans, look forward to the next one. This was a painful read. The elementary style of the writing made me wonder who actually wrote this book. The wartime segment was endless. At one point I thought about shooting myself to end the misery. But the most disappointing part of this book -- there were several potential twists for an ending that, even as a lowly self published writer, jumped off the page. And because Grisham failed to do that, It was a long journey into blah.  The ending was ridiculous.  He stated that much of this was prefabricated for the purpose of the story.  Some better prefab was certainly in order. Very disappointing!!!",3
1.0,Lazy,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"I own almost every Grisham novel. The Firm is still one of my favorite reads, and made a fairly good movie. The Reckoning is not even in the same universe. It’s lazy writing, repetitive narrative (yes, you established one of the main characters suffered in the war, but I don’t need a poorly written masters thesis on the Bataan death march to emphasize it. I guess this would be a suspense novel, but the build up is so mediocre, even the twist is pretty “meh”. I only feel any sympathy for one character (barely). The rest are merely caricatures. Many others have said how poor this is, and I have to agree. Grisham admits to stealing the story, so here is my recommendation. If you still have an ACTUAL bookstore near you, flip to page 409 and read the last few pages and save yourself the $ and the slog of 400 pages of lazy “meh”.",2
1.0,"Waste of Time, Money and Storytelling","November 2, 2018",Yes,"I purchase Grisham novels because I enjoy legal thrillers. One third of this book was purely an historical account of the Pacific Theater in World War II. The other two thirds were a rambling, dissatisfying and depressing tale of a Southern family’s road to ruin that turns out to be all in vain. This book is so far different from any of the Grisham “Clanton, Mississippi” novels I have trouble believing the same author wrote it. The author’s note says this was based on a “water coolor” tall tale and it should have stayed at the water cooler.  Don’t waste your money or your time!",3
5.0,Never Disappointed,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"I have read every book written by John Grisham, and have yet to be disappointed.  I love his choice of  characters, and the flow of his books.  I found The Reckoning to be yet another that I just could not put down.  His details of the Baatan Death march was remarkable in detail.  Can't wait for his next book!!!",6
1.0,A good author who has lost his way!,"November 12, 2018",Yes,I normally enjoy John Grisham's novels. But this story line is evil and immoral almost from beginning to end.  It is well written but why corrupt your mind.  Extremely disappointing due to his background and knowledge of good moral standards.,4
2.0,A Noble Effort....that Just Doesn't Work!,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"I've read and largely enjoyed virtually everything JG has written until this one... To avoid ""Spoiler Alerts"", I'll be a bit evasive...nevertheless, this novel has 3 or possibly 4 sections; the opening phase which does an excellent job of presenting the major ""event"" which triggers lots of anticipation of possible explanations yet to be divulged, then we wade through a ridiculously long narrative about life ""on the run"" during WWII, and then a surprising development which gives the reader hope that truth and justice will prevail, and the later phases of the book tease at possible explanations and ultimately one is  packaged and presented in a hurried, non-plausible fashion that leaves this reader wondering what the heck possessed a man of JG's talents and wordsmith abilities to subject us to this bit of drivel...As a writer myself (tho I admittedly stretch conventional definitions of the term in light of my publishing history /record compared to that of JG), I find this book to be a sophomoric attempt that falls short in so many ways...",1
5.0,Don't listen to all the reviews!,"November 1, 2018",Yes,I had already purchased this book and was already turned off when reading some of the early reviews.  I am an avid John Grisham fan having purchased and read every book he has published.  I thoroughly enjoyed his latest book and admire him for mixing it up from the usual legal thrillers.  He is one of the best if not the best storyteller of our time.,8
1.0,Very Disappointed,"November 14, 2018",Yes,My family has always looked forward to the next John Grisham book. Once I buy it I will pass it on to my adult children. But not this one. I don’t want them wasting their time on this one. Doesn’t match the quality of any of his other books. Very very disappointed in this one and hope that this isn’t a trend because I will read reviews from now on before I automatically by one of his books.,3
5.0,Gripping,"October 26, 2018",Yes,I have not been able to stick with any of John Grisham's books for years; not until I started The Reckoning.  The book is wonderful and I can hardly put it down.  He's back and has provided us with a gripper.,5
5.0,Not for the squeamish!,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"One heck of a story, it was a very dark, tense and depressing story.  I really liked it and could not put it down, but it was tough to read at times.  The ending floored me.  I would have given it 6 stars.",5
1.0,THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE!!! DO NOT BUY,"October 31, 2018",Yes,I have read all of john.s books. There was nobody but the Japanese army soldiers to hate. The hero was dead before the middle of the book.  As a reader i already kne the wife was the problem.  Some terrible social code was crossed.  At the end u are told who it was . Even the hero's children were not likable.!!!!!!!!!!! Compare this book to the book before about the book dealer. no comparison! Give us our money back John. Charles L. Jackson,3
1.0,Depressing &amp; Uninspiring,"November 13, 2018",Yes,I have read all of John Grisham's books as each and every one one of them have been pages turners however The Reckoning is completely off the mark from what he usually writes. The secret only came out at the end and the entire story started with a negative and ended in a catastrophe. The Boneyard part of the book was far too detailed in relation to the actual gist of the book which was after all Pete Banning's Reckoning. Overall a very bad read and rather disappointing for an author that I have always held in high esteem.,4
2.0,Untypical and disappointing,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"The author claims that he based this novel on a story he heard as a young man. But it is hardly a novel in any normal sense of the word. It is as pointless and incomprehensible as real life. To that extent it really does seem to capture reality. The scenes, characters and experiences are all highly credible. But they don’t go anywhere or do anything. I found the ending peculiarly unsatisfying. I really regret the time I spent reading it and cannot recommend it to anyone else. This is astonishing, from an author I have read and enjoyed in volume after volume.",2
5.0,The Reckoning,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"In my mind this is quite possibly the best book John Grisham has written to date and I've read every book he has written!  Great characters for sure but it also gave me a  better understanding of a portion of WWII.  I even read part of this book in the midst of company, which was quite rude of me, but that's how much I enjoyed it!!!",5
1.0,DARK AND DARKER!,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"""The Reconing"" is the darkest book that I've ever read. Unfortunately, I read it to the bitter (and sudden) end because I couldn't believe that the story wouldn't come into the sunshine before it ended. It didn't!..What happened to John Gresham, the brilliant writer? How did he devolve into so much darkness and sadness? Why did his editor abandon him?.""The Reconing"" is a book about human misery, darkness, depression, and hopelessness. If it was a musical the title song would contain the words of the old ""Hee Haw"" hit... ""Gloom despair, and misery on me. Deep dark depression - excessive misery..."" It begins dark and gets darker, and when Gresham finally purges the darkness from his mind... he abruptly ends the story..Save your money... you should be able to get this book at a thrift shop for a dollar real soon.",1
2.0,Disappointing,"October 29, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham gave legal novels a unique dimension. His stories had a Br’er Rabbit-like quality to them, dealt with issues of consequence and set them in the magnolia-scented South. They were page-turners; they kept you reading when you knew you should be getting your sleep for a busy day ahead..That’s what’s missing in The Reckoning. In a word, it’s  boring. The obligatory court room scenes are there, with the maneuverings and the voir-dires and the cross-examinations, and you c an smell the magnolias, but the pace is slow, the digressions many and I found myself speed-skipping whole paragraphs with a muttered “Get on with it!”",2
3.0,Not bad but we expect more,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"An intriguing premise. A war hero and respected farmer kills a preacher and no one knows why and he isn't saying..It had me hooked..On the upside, Grisham has found a good hook and uses his methodical piece by piece approach to give us the back story on the hero and all the other main characters. It does bog down at times and I grew restless. Some of the court testimony slows things down to much..The degradation in the Phillipines is layered on so thick it hard not to begin skimming to escape the awfulness. Powerful though..And when the payoff comes?.It is generally predictable, although the detail has some twists. But all in all, it is oddly flat after so much that has gone before..This book has flashes of what draws us to Grisham and it isn't bad. We just have come to expect more.",1
1.0,The last straw...,"October 23, 2018",Yes,I have read all of Grisham’s books. The last few years I have disappointed with his releases. I continued to hope that the books would have some of the suspense and tension of his earlier books. But every time I have been disappointed...In this book by chapter 2 you know the ending of the book. The second part of the book is a flashback to the Batann Death March. The third part tries to tie it all together. The problem is you don’t care about the main characters...I wasted a day reading this book. But the silver lining for me is that this is the straw that broke the camel’s back. I will never buy another one of his books.,10
1.0,A let down.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"Grisham's writing style is wonderful. But his story choices and decisions are more than disappointing.  The first third of this book was good, interesting, and made me want to read the outcome, though I was disappointed in the main character's demise.  The middle of the book...I pretty much skipped it, deciding the long...extremely repetitive details of the Bataan Death March, was totally unnecessary, excessive, and almost caused me to toss the book.  The last third, which I had some hope, let me down.  This might be my problem, but I'm not enamored in reading a depressing book without any redemption, as much as life and reality might be that way.  I hated the outcome and end of the book.  I will think twice about considering a Gresham book again...and I've read every one of this adult books.",1
4.0,Grisham’s 1940s Mississippi meets World War II and its aftermath,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"This is the story of the savaging of a prosperous southern family led by Pete Banning, a proud farmer who is also a war hero. In the opening of the book, he murders a clergyman and then refuses to discuss his actions while nevertheless taking responsibility for them. He never explains his motive for murder or attempts to justifiy what he has done publicly.  Discovering the motive for the killing is therefore a central theme of the book...This narration later goes back to Pete’s suffering and heroism during the Second World War when he survived the Bataan Death March and his subsequent imprisonment in a brutal Japanese prisoner of war camp. He later escapes from the Japanese and fights as a guerrilla leader.  He operates effectively  out of the Philippine jungle, against  near impossible odds, even while desperately sick with malaria and other ailments .  Grisham devotes considerable attention to Pete’s suffering and service during the war, and at times this seems a little odd since it is so different from his other novels.  He also makes Pete an almost bigger-than-life combat leader whose time as a guerilla is almost equal parts misery and highly successful strikes against the Japanese...The other parts of the story involve Pete’s actions and those of his family in Mississippi of the 1940s. The nature of Jim Crow in Mississippi is a constant background for the part of the story that does not take place in the Philippines. One character even discusses the black workers on Pete’s farm in the same way you would talk about slaves.  Pete’s children appear to be nice people, and it is their responsibility  to deal with a great many problems and to continue to move their own lives forward as best they can... Also, I listened to this novel as an audiobook, and I feel remiss that this is the first time that I have commented on the brilliant reading  of John Grisham‘s books by Michael Beck.  Grisham is a  towering novelist and Beck is the perfect narrator for his work... Finally, I have included a picture of some Japanese weapons from World War II, including an officer’s sword  and scabbard. During most of his service as a guerrilla in the Philippines, Pete was carrying captured weapons.  As a POW, he was continuously trying to avoid death at the hands of Japanese soldiers who favored the bayonet or officers who sometimes used their swords on captured soldiers.",1
5.0,"""You Keep Me Hanging On""  (Vanilla Fudge 1967)","October 31, 2018",Yes,"I haven't read a new Grisham novel for quite a long time, believing that he would continue to generate the same basic formula like a lot of authors are persuaded to by their editors in order to continue to sell more books to the same audience.  That may work for the casual reader but there are people like me who demand original thought, varied plot lines, fleshed out characters along with easily visualized environments, and realistic actions taken by reasonable people based on the information they have available to them.  Whew!  That was a mouthful.  Of course humor in all its forms is appreciated as well as following the main character stumble through the story as an imperfect -- but well-meaning -- hero...John Grisham includes all of this in ""The Reckoning"" as well as the somewhat unusual strategy of having the ending told before the backstory is revealed.  Interesting reading from an extremely talented storyteller.  Included in the backstory is a detailed synopsis of America's efforts in WWII concerning the battle for the Philippines, the ineffective leadership of General MacArthur (""I shall return"" -- but only when it's safe), the Bataan Death March, and the guerilla warfare successfully waged against the Japanese invaders. It's not for the squeamish, but then again war never is...But the true story is about the Deep South during the 1940's: the cotton fields and black fieldhands, the big house and small shotgun shacks, the segregation that was accepted as a way of life, the role of the local churches, and the societal rules that still prevented and painfully punished those who chose to ignore what was considered proper southern etiquette.  This novel takes you on a trip that seems to point unwaveringly to the final destination but ends up at a totally different place.  The result is an interesting and surprising twist considering the social consciousness of the times.  What makes it truly interesting is who was sacrificed and why it was done...This is one hell of a story that informs, entertains, and is a solid comment on relationships in the Deep South.  You will enjoy it if you allow yourself to be pulled into the story.  The ending will certainly get your attention.  Not since Greg Iles has anyone written such a fascinating tale of Mississippi...""You Keep Me Hanging On"" is an appropriate song for how this story plays out.  You have to decide which version is better -- Vanilla Fudge or The Supremes.",1
1.0,Grisham is slowly losing it. With this morbid tale he has hit bottom,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"I don't want to repeat what has already been said more eloquently than I ever could. A point that I would like to make has to do with dragging up the death march and the horribly inhumane treatment Americans and Philippinos had to endure or die of...This is a senseless revival of atrocities committed by the Japanese of  several generations ago is an insult to all those fine, hardworking people, including thousands in the US who immigrated here long after that war. If it were a Hollywood  production I could understand it. Being of German ancestry and observing year after like clockwork the release of yet another Nazi movie, compliments of the top-heavy Jewish movie industry which seems to feel obligated to produce such relentless trash with great regularity, I feel great sympathy for Japanese Americans who like I have never been spared this hideous custom...When I lived in Kew Gardens Hills in New York we periodically had to hit the mattresses for a few days each year in order not to bump into neighbors in this solidly Jewish (and very lovely) community ans hyphenated Germans. Our Accent would have given us away in a heartbeat. So I know the effect this trashy novel will have, especially among the homophobic masses in my host country. You were born here, you had no choice. I did. I could have stayed in Hamburg or moved to England, Australia or any other English speaking country to learn the language and see another culture. But I cam here, and not for economic reasons. I am sure the same can be said for most Japanese Americans...I haven't seen any Hollywood movies in the 55 years I have lived here, depicting the ethnic clensing of Native Amerians or about the killing of 30,000 women cand children in Iraq not that long ago. I wonder why that is...But back to Grisham. Besides the gratuitous and inflamatory wallowings in gore, filth and bodyparts which he more or less copied from another writer if the stories are true about that, the book lacks any redeeming quality. It drags on and on as readers familiar with his earlier works expect any moment some big twist in the plot that will have made spending the money and suffering through the first half of this boring yearn worthwhile. It never came. The lame attempt at a ""surprise ending at the very end of this book"" falls flat as well. Surely, having to labor through 400 pages of artless scribblings deserves a great deal more from Mr. Grisham to redeem himself. This is the last book I will ever touch from this author. He should have known long ago that it was time to hang it up.",0
5.0,An Epic Novel,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"Having read all of John Grisham’s books, The Reckoning ranks among my favorite top three of his publications. In his latest work, Grisham expands the breadth of his talent as a writer with a middle part more resembling historical fiction than his typical “policier” thrillers in which the story centers around legal/courtroom drama. The time period spans the mid-1920’s to 1950. Setting: Ford County and World War II, jungles of the Philippines. The book is divided into the following three parts: (1) The Killing. The reader is introduced to the main character Pete Banning — a stoic, man-of-few-words and favorite son-war-hero-father who shoots dead, in the church, his friend and beloved pastor, the Reverend Dexter Bell. The legal outcome of the “event” concludes the first part of the story; (2) The Boneyard. The reader is taken back to Pete Banning’s early life — 1925, a recent 22 year old graduate from the U.S. Military Academy, West Point; the reader gains a portrait of the main character’s privileged life, courtship/marriage to Liza, and most notably, the Bataan Death March. In Part 2, the writing style transitions to a historical fiction as Grisham’s words describe a vividly animated historical picture of Pete Banning as a soldier-turned-war hero, including his adaptation/survival from the horrific acts by the Japanese to the enemy; the reader learns what gave Banning the fortitude to return home an alive albeit wounded war hero; and, (3) The Betrayal. The story returns to a style characteristic of Grisham novels — the courtroom drama focused on the Banning property, Banning’s family, outcomes of law suits, and “The Reckoning.”",2
5.0,A Gem from Mr. Grisham,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"I pre-ordered as always, know that once I read page one it will take a natural disaster or other catastrope to keep me from reading on..That this book departs from the legal thriller theme we expect from Mr. Grisham showcases the man's incredible storytelling abilities. We are given a puzzle, or several really and a rich cast of characters seeking answers alongside the reader. As a history buff, I am loathe to admit the paucity of knowledge I held before on the Philippines and The Battan March during WWII prior to reading ""The Reckoning""..This provides a great reading experience and I highly recommend ""The Reckoning"".",2
1.0,worst book he's ever written,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"His reputation and other books begged me to buy this one for Holiday reading. A waste of time. He should be embarrassed for putting this into print. One of the reviews, that I read after the purchase and reading says exactly on how feel also ""If I were a writer and knew that I would have to give up money if I didn't have a ""book"" on my publisher's desk by a date certain, and time was up, this is the kind of load of crap I would dish up. What passes for a plot is meaningless: the whole book is fleshed out with WW II history that needn't be narrated as fiction, and arcane minutiae of criminal and civil procedure that couldn't be more boring and, moreover, is woefully inaccurate. I actually felt that I'd been tricked into reading this steamer by being bamboozled by Grisham's reputation, on which I can't comment. BORING!!!!!!"".I'm putting this writer in the not again list for awhile!",1
1.0,Disappointing,"November 1, 2018",Yes,This story started out okay is a huge waste of time. I skipped through much of the book because the many chapters dedicate to the war were so graphic i just couldn't read it. The story fell apart and I just didnt care much about the characters. The ending was so unsatisfying. I feel I wasted my money on this book. I never thought I'd say that about a Grisham novel.,4
5.0,Best story I’ve read in a long time,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"What a great read, you won’t be able to put it down,  amazing story.  I can’t wait till they make this into a film...l",5
5.0,Another thrilling tale from John Grisham,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"Was it two books or three books in one? The first book is the mysterious tale of a survivor of the War in the Philippines who came home to murder the local preacher. We followed his trial and execution without ever hearing a motive for the murder...Then we heard the heroic tale of a cavalry lieutenant fighting the Japanese and enduring unspeakable hardships in captivity after surrendering to the Japanese. We also hear about the Bataan Death March and the stories of the survivors...Through a miracle, Pete Dunning escapes captivity and fights on as a guerrilla hiding in the jungle p, fighting both the Japanese and disease...Finally we pick up the story after the execution of Pete Dunning through the eyes of his son, Joel. We follow the suits for wrongful death and the quest to seize the Dunning Estate...This book takes longer than most to read, but the sadness of the twist at the conclusion is worth the read. You never see this ending coming. There’s a fourth book left to your imagination, the tale of an unscrupulous lawyer who marries the widow of the preacher Pete Dunning murdered in a sickening land grab. What happens next? That’s left to your imagination.",0
2.0,"With great beginning, the read fell quickly to a contrived THUD! But one surprise...","October 31, 2018",Yes,"The first third of the Novel raised this reader’s hope for another Grisham spell-binder. Alas, rewrite of WWII Philippines and a herky- jerky plodding of characters begging to be developed did not. Then a twisted, hasty ending that leaves the reader wondering if the whole plot was just a bad dream..And finally the Author  admits it was a tale he heard during an unsatisfying  time in the  Mississippi legislature! Bored to tears swapping old wive’s tales in the hallways or in a Jackson bar..Damn, my hopes were so high for this one. But, hey, John: I’m not giving up on ya! Take your time, next time....the old Grisham is still there. Your loyalists are bettin on ya!",1
4.0,Betrayal,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I liked this departure from Mr. Grisham’s usual fast paced thrillers. The story is about a family in rural Mississippi. It starts with a premeditated murder and we spend the next 400 pages finding out why. It is a character study, a deep dive into WW2 in the Philippines and small town, post war Mississippi. The writing is solid, the plot intricate and the characters well developed ... you cannot ask for more...PS. The bad reviews are locked on how “boring” this book is because of so much WW2 stuff. These readers are boring they expect one sort of book out of an author and cannot stand it if he or she doesn’t deliver. This is a good book!",2
1.0,no real point to this boring book,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"Selling strictly because of the writers reputation, that's why I bought it, don't waste your money it stinks.",4
1.0,Not a great read,"October 28, 2018",Yes,Very disappointed in this book. Total waste of my time and n.Monte. Nit up to the books I have read by this author.,4
3.0,"Too Much History, Too Little Grisham","December 3, 2018",Yes,"I read Grisham for the courtroom drama and suspense -- not to get a very long and detailed history lesson. The book starts off with promise. War hero Pete Banning walks into his church and murders the pastor, Dexter Bell. No reason why, and he hamstrings his lawyer from defending him in any meaningful way. For good measure, he has remanded his wife Liza to a mental institution. All very mysterious, and so far so good...Where this book becomes tedious is with the background and explanation of the why Banning committed the murder. It traces things back to his soldier days, including very long detailed descriptions of the battles, historical facts, POW experiences, guerrilla soldier experiences. When I say long detailed descriptions, I mean pages upon pages. As other said, I skipped long portions of the book. I'm just not a history buff...While other books Grisham writes have historical underpinnings, they are just enough detail to support what he is good at writing: legal and courtroom dramas. I cannot recommend this book.",1
2.0,"Go back to the drawing board, John","November 30, 2018",Yes,"First, a disclaimer: I have read all of Grisham's books and there have been some good ones. Ironically, some of my favorites are not his legal thrillers. Alas, his last three books, to my mind, have been awful. They seem to define ""cranking out one every year."" This book is no exception. Exactly what is it? Historical fiction? Legal/courtroom drama? Murder mystery? Soap opera? It doesn't work on any level for me. And it's a typical John Grisham ending which is to say, no ending. It's like he just gets bored and decides to wrap things up in 4-5 pages. His endings are terrible. It pains me to say this, but this could be my last John Grisham book. I don't need to put any more into his already rich pockets.",1
4.0,Quite different,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"This was not a kind of story you normally write. The graphic description of the death march was so real. I lived through world war 2.  I was surprised by this book. I have read all your books. I am 83 years old. Please keep writing. I really wish you knew my story. Best wishes, Mary",4
3.0,way too long and slow-paced,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"I'm a huge Grisham fan and have read most of his books - the good and the not good...This one started with an interesting premise, but then it started dragging on and on: all the characters were conjecturing about what might have happened, then we go back and forth from past to present to shed some light on events, but it was never enough to explain anything and only provided useless details...The thing that infuriated me the most is that none of the characters was courageous enough to just come out and ask for the truth - they just stood by and watched everything unfurl in front of them. I understood that the main character's temper never allowed any discussion when he had made a decision, but knowing that so much was at stake should've prompted either the son, the daughter or the sister to do something, especially when they knew it was absolutely wrong and had seriously affected another family member...Well, this is just another Grisham book that didn't make the cut for me.",1
4.0,"A good recall of why MacArthur was called ""dugout Doug""","November 11, 2018",Yes,"While several have commented that this was not up to normal expectations from Grisham,  I think they miss the point of the story.  First, Grisham comments this was based on a story he recalled from many years ago.  He states he may have confused or forgotten some of the details, but asks any of his readers to contact him if they recall a similar story.  Second, as with all of his Ford county books, he likes to paint a picture of the culture and the temperament of the rural south.  Not to sound condescending, if you haven't lived it, you wouldn't get it.  Also, his description of the war in the Pacific Theater, Bataan, Luzon, Death March were spot on.  He shows he is a history buff getting some digs at that cowardly snake, ""dugout"" Doug MacArthur.  You become very intimate with the person and understand you can strip them of everything except their pride..So many say they saw the ending so plainly, and that it seemed rushed.  Again, I think you miss the point.  This was in effect a true ""ending"".  The end of a family, a heritage, a way of life.  You walk away and never look back.",3
5.0,It will keep you wondering til the end,"October 26, 2018",Yes,The talent of a great author sometimes is to keep you hanging to the end. There is no need to lay down the major details as they are described in the description of the book. The story starts in Mississippi and eventually to the Philippines to tell the back story of Pete Banning...I have heard of the Bataan death March but did not know a lot about it. In a article I read about John Grisham writing this book he mentioned that he read 10 books about Bataan and I have to assume that a lot of the descriptions of what Pete and his fellow soldiers went is absolutely horrifying it makes you wonder how long humanity can go during war...I see the average review is 3 stars and I figured part was that this story was going to leave you in suspense. I was going to be so mad. But Grisham keeps stringing you along. Read this book to the very end. I had my doubts being that this was something different for John Grisham but this is 5 stars.,2
3.0,"Historical fiction, not legal thriller","October 28, 2018",Yes,"I’m always excited to read Grisham’s new releases and eagerly anticipated The Reckoning, anxious to settle in and read it in one sitting since I usually find his books impossible to put down once I’ve started reading the first page. Alas, on the contrary, I had no problem setting The Reckoning aside after a dozen chapters and for I g myself to pick it up again the next evening, and the next, and the next. Sigh. This novel, IMO, should be classified as historical fiction rather than a legal thriller. If you’re interested in WWII then you might enjoy this story, at least the middle section of the book. Overall I found it somewhat tedious to read, felt no connection to the characters in any way, didn’t find any of them likeable. The few legal situations were bland so I skimmed over parts of chapters. I also found the outcome somewhat predictable, but by the end I really didn’t care anymore about who, what or why. Just wanted it to be over. Now I’m wondering if there will be a sequel, tying Joel and Stella to Florry’s farm, connecting Joel to the Wilbanks law firm and Lucien’s lineage.",8
1.0,My Last Pre-order,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"Being a fan of John Grisham, I’ve gotten used to his aversion to predictable, happy endings.  I usually pre- order his books in faith that the book will be great.  This book, like “The Appeal”, has broken that trust. From now on I’ll wait to read some reviews first.  This book has no redeeming qualities.  It starts off with the main character committing a murder and basically, there is no plot.  The book follows him through his war ordeal and finally answers the question of why he committed murder.  The reader already knew why with one small, uninteresting twist.  This is a great Grisham book to skip.",1
3.0,Disappointing!,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"I feel like I just read John Steinback's ""Grapes of Wrath"", again! Not what I expected from John Grisham. I loved all the Ford County stories! It started the same as all of them. I waited A year for this! A page turner! One after the other. Until you reach a certain point. No where will you find John Grisham's form of Karma! So much suffering!",2
1.0,The Reckoning is so depressing I won't finish it.,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"This ""WHY DONE IT"" book is too slow and far too depressing to make me willing to hang in to learn the why.  I usually love John Grisham but I really regret buying this one.  More than half through the book, I decided my time is too precious to me to finish.",3
1.0,couldn't put it down but should have!,"November 23, 2018",Yes,"The hook gets set early and I continued reading in hope the secret would be worth it. Many times I told myself nothing could be worth the tedium, but I stayed with it and completely regretted it. Unless you know nothing of the atrocities of the Japanese in the Pacific during WW2, there is nothing even to learn. A small bit about the electric chair confuses the relationship between current and voltage. Bad stuff.",2
4.0,Grisham Surprise!,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"Unlike most of Grisham's recent novels, this one contains a sizable and appalling  history of the Battle of Bataan during World War II. Set in a Mississippi village a few years after the war,  the book begins with the murder of the town's most admired pastor by a leading citizen who fought in that battle; lost to Japanese forces. Regarded as a local hero by the townspeople, the killer refuses to explain his action or defend himself..In addition to the meticulously researched history, the book creates a chilling but accurate look at the Deep South just after the war,  finally explaining what had been an unbelievable crime until the last few pages...At the end of the book, Grisham tells his readers that The Reckoning  was based upon a story he had been told, and asks them if they might know the origin.",0
1.0,Too much hype,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"“The Reckoning is his most powerful, surprising, and suspenful thriller yet.”..I was very disappointed in this novel after all the hype as stated above.  Although the first part captured my attention, once it continued it dragged on with too much attention devoted to back story of Pete Banning’s time in the war.  Ultimately, none of that truly related to the reasons he felt he needed to murder the pastor...I have always looked forward to John Grisham’s novels (have read all of the ‘adult’ ones), but i was truly disappointed in this novel.  I even skipped many pages while he was giving his history lesson...Even when the truth finally comes out about Liza, it was not much of a surprise.",2
1.0,not for the squeamish,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"I would not call this a thriller.  More like an historical novel of the Bataan Death March attached to about the most unoriginal mystery plot I have ever read.  Mr.  Grisham, what is the problem?  I know you to be a clever, very readable writer.  Compare your first novel A Time to Kill with this atrocity and hang your head in shame.",2
4.0,Blank in the middle...,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"What a strange book. Divided into 3 parts, the first vintage Grisham, the second a history lesson &amp; the third back to Grisham. I have read all of his books, this is the first I couldn’t give 5 stars to. The first &amp; third parts were very well written depicting Ford County in the 1940’s. I skimmed thru the second part, it was over 100 pages, I just needed a summary. Not interested in the history but to give him credit my historian son says he accurately portrayed the Bataan March. I would have liked more character development of Liza &amp; her personal interactions. The legal developments left me feeling helpless. The ending, I would have preferred some justice for Joel &amp; Stella. But the author decides the ending, it’s only a book &amp; that’s how it goes. Can’t wait for his next book.",1
5.0,"Fascinating book, quite different from the many others I've read by Grisham","October 25, 2018",Yes,"This turned out to be an excellent book. Without writing 'spoilers', what appeared in Part I as serious timeline problems, all became clear in Part II. It is a depressing, dark tale, quite different from Grisham books I've previously read. Spellbinding tale of war, family, and the old South. Highly recommended.",3
5.0,One of Grisham's finest even with a rushed ending,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I loved this book until the ending. Grishman told this story in a slow, meticulous manner. The character development was exceptional thought the book. You couldn't wait to see what happens next and does Pete tell his story...The detailed description of Pete's horrendous ordeal during the war made me cringe with horror and grief. You know his pain and suffering during his time as a captive and as a guerrilla soldier during the time of the Bataan Death March was exactly like it really was. HIs tremendous will to live so he could see his wife and kids again was contagious and made you forget that this was a fictional character..The way the author told the story in three different parts was brilliant. The ending however was rushed in my opinion. Grisham built you up throughout the whole book and then told the deep dark secret he had been building up to in a short amount of time. Don't get me wrong, the ending was brilliant but just too short.",1
2.0,the story was too drawn out,"October 29, 2018",Yes,very boring.,5
4.0,An Okay Story But Not Grisham’s Best,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"The Reckoning was a different kind of story I normally attribute to John Grisham. I liked parts of it but not all. It seemed to drag in places where a a great amount of detail was used to describe parts of the story where I thought less would have been better. The middle section subtitled The Boneyard dealing with the Bataan death march and POW camps was quite interesting to me. Parts 1 and 3 dealing expressly with the story line went together but could have been covered in fewer words, I thought. The ending was hinted at and somewhat predictable although there was a bit of a surprise that I won’t spoil here. This book wasn’t as satisfying to me as Grisham’s usual and expected courtroom yarns. All in all it was okay but isn’t my favorite.",0
4.0,This Ones Different,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"This is not a legal thriller like most other novels written by Grisham. It kept me reading even in the parts that were less interesting. One third of the book is action-history about WWII in the pacific. I read way more than I would have or needed to read, but I stuck with it because I wanted to get to the end of the story In fact I was so anxious to get to the end that I read it in two days. I usually enjoy Grisham's work and he is an excellent storyteller when he is does not digress into his other interest or concerns . In this story I never connect with any of the characters perhaps because they were underdeveloped. On the other hand he has taken a common southern-cultural narrative and turned it upside down.",0
3.0,Entertaining,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"This is a good legal novella to which a large dollop of WWII history has been added to make it a novel.  The story line with its twists, turns, irony and suspense are entertaining.  The history lesson, though fascinating unto itself, is unnecessary to further the plot. Long descriptive passages detailing Pete Bannning's participation in the horrific Bataan Death March, survival, guerrilla fighting and his subsequent death in the electric chair are gruesome to say the least. Because of them this book is not for the faint of heart. The Banning family secrets kept me guessing right up to the end and the ultimate revelation was a surprise.  This is not one of Grisham's best efforts, but I'm not sorry I read it.",0
4.0,Not as good as most,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"Although this book could be entertaining in certain parts, I didn't enjoy it as much as Grisham's other books!  I liked the way he set up the plot in Part I of the novel, but I thought Part II was way too long in describing the main character's experiences during WWII.  I got the gist of the horrors he and others experienced during the war in the first so many chapters, and the great detail in the lengthy chapters didn't necessarily add as much to the plot or develop how the experiences affected the main character as I think Grisham wanted.  Then, in Part III, the reader doesn't find out till the last few pages of the book why they main character killed the pastor...it just seemed to have ended abruptly!  I also think an Epilogue would've worked to tie up a few loose ends by describing how everything ultimately affected the adult lives of his children!",0
5.0,"Once Again, a Fine Story","November 1, 2018",Yes,"As a born and raised Memphian with deep ties to all things Mississippi,  I've devoured each Grisham novel of late looking for the early days of his writing. I found it here. A wonderful story of the simple beautiful life of the Delta made extremely complex by the people who live there. What a fabulous couple of afternoons I spent lost reading of being in small town Mississippi, in a wood or field in the Delta, living with wonderful black friends and caretakers, buzzing down to New Orleans for some magic time, sitting or sitting on a back porch after a wonderful Delta farm meal with a toddy with family. James Patterson just wrote a novel that was to rival Grisham in his Juror #3 and it's a fine yarn much like A Time to Kill was for Grisham, but this book The Reckoning puts John Grisham a step above Patterson in this type of storyline. Even the side story of the Bataan WWII period of one of the characters was a great second story which is pure Grisham to me. Buy it, devour it. You will enjoy its complex look on family life...we all have families and they all have stories and this one is a whopper.",2
5.0,What a story!,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"Grisham is always an excellent story teller.  In this one his order is present, past, and then the real present.  As a reader who has never been to Ford County or the Phillipines,  I feel like I know both intimately.  Most compelling Grisham novel yet. You will not be disappointed.",3
3.0,A lot of reading---for what?,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"Grisham is a great story teller.  Otherwise, I would never have finished this disappointing novel.  In Part I, which should have been last, the reader is strung along, hoping something would save the hero.  Instead, we have to follow all frustrating details until the last gory description of an electrocution.  Then come the horrors of the Bataan Death March, a few of which the reader might have been spared.  Finally, the reader plows on, hoping the hero's kids will unearth and use to prevent the loss of their inheritance.  But no, the hero's son makes no use of the obvious reasons for his father's crime.  Only Grisham's talent as a writer kept me going through a long and frustrating read.",0
3.0,Mr. Grisham wanted,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"to tell a historical tale of Bataan. It takes up the middle of this novel. Anyone interested in Bataan from a soldiers point of view.will find Mr. Grisham’s incredibly detailed, researched account masterful. Anyone not interested in the war in Bataan should probably give this book a pass. I’m torn as it was so incredibly.researched, I feel the need to applaud but....it wasn’t advertised as an historical account of a horrible piece of WW II.",1
3.0,ummmm,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"SPOILERS:  So I thought this novel would wrap up with some traitorous war action by Bell and that's why Pete had to kill him. But really... an affair? People have affairs all the time and don't kill the other person in cold blood. If Grisham had made it about the war (perhaps Bell could have given up their troop's positions somehow?? Maybe heard it from a relative  over there - whatever) that would have made it more justifiable for Pete to kill him in such a calculated way, and would have made all the Bataan Death March stuff more relevant to the story. I would have applauded Pete for killing Bell if it risked his troop's lives. But Pete's reason in the end made me feel  that he was a bit melodramatic and over-reactive.",0
4.0,3 stories in one,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"This book was like reading three related stories in one. The first story talks about a horrible, inexplicable crime committed by a war hero. In some ways this first section dragged on to an inevitable end and the story could have been half as long. The second story flashes back to the main characters war experience as a soldier, prisoner and war hero. The third story follows after the events of the first story and ties it all together. And when the secret is revealed what the reader thought was obvious isn't at all. The tragedy of this book is even worse than you expected. If the first section was about half as long I would have rated the book a 5 star instead of a 4 star.",0
5.0,Good Old Grisham!,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"The Reckoning is a great tale, with many turns and twists that kept me guessing nearly to the last page. It is a tale filled with pathos, a story filled with nostalgia and a sense of “if only this or only that had happened.”  I wish the book had been double or triple its current length — I did not want the story to end...Grisham kept the pacing just right — not too fast, not too slow.  I liked the characters and felt they were “real people,” except maybe for Joel and Stella, who seemed shallow (literally and figuratively), as if Grisham did not pay as much attention to their characters as he did to Pete’s and Florrie’s...Unlike many of Grisham’s novels, The Reckoning is not a “legal thriller.”  It is a search for truth and meaning, and perhaps a cautionary tale about being careful about what you wish for.  A great read!",0
4.0,An Intriguing Twist of Fate,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"Grisham's novel is an intriguing tale that takes the reader on a journey from a small town in Mississippi to the Philippine Islands during the Second World War, searching for a motive to what was a cold blooded murder. Although the story kept me involved, multiple clues were provided early on that pointed to the motive. In the end, a slight twist changed the ending from what was assumed but ever so slightly, almost in an attempt to ""fool"" the reader in the end. The story itself was relatively fast reading but be warned that the chapters devoted to the Bataan death march were pretty difficult to read. Its a good book and worth the read for those that enjoy light mysteries.",0
2.0,A twisted tale for sure,"November 7, 2018",Yes,I have read every book by John Grisham and when this one was advertised I pre-ordered immediately. I have to admit I read nothing about the book in advance. When it turned into a graphic account of WWII I was astounded. This went on for over half of the book but I hung in there . The ending left me very disappointed..I will definitely buy the next Grisham book but I hope he returns to a good attorney mystery again.,1
5.0,John Grisham does it again!,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"This author can tell a tale like nobody else! He made me feel for the characters, and each chapter developed them with such finesse that I had an inkling of what the ending would entail, but I was still very surprised by the last minute plot twist. I don’t want to include any spoilers, but take this as a word of caution - I have a very close relative who is in the army, &amp; I’ve warned his family to avoid this book because it will give them nightmares. This is particularly true about the second part of the book. Overall, it’s a very interesting and important part of the book in terms of character development. A very well deserved 5 stars!!!",3
5.0,Great Mystery,"October 26, 2018",Yes,John does it again with another great book. The suspense keeps you reading to find out what is next. Truly enjoyed another great Grisham book and highly recommend to those who enjoy suspense and mysteries. One you will not want to put down till the end.,2
5.0,Good book,"November 23, 2018",Yes,"I enjoyed the story, the history of the Batan march was very eye opening. The story of the family and it's trials  reminds us how cruel ones own family can be. Not a real happy story but is well written and moves at a good pace.",3
3.0,"Interesting in parts, but not well written, and the end disappoints","November 11, 2018",Yes,"""The Reckoning"" focuses on a WWII vet who returns home to Mississippi from the Pacific theater after suffering the Bataan death march and imprisonment as POW and then escaping to fight as a guerilla from the mountains of the Philippines.  Although a hero, he murders a minister in cold blood and refuses to reveal his motive and we spend the rest of the novel wondering why. Grisham's description of the MC's time in the Philippines is well done. But I found the rest of the novel to be a chore, mostly because Mr. Grisham chose to ""tell"" his story rather than reveal his characters through well-constructed, dramatic scenes. He tells us not only what happens, but how we should feel about it. Pete, the main character is pretty well drawn; but the rest of the characters are hardly drawn at all. We're constantly told how to feel about them (this person's ""heroic;"" that person's ""greedy"") and we're never really given the opportunity to come to our own conclusions. And the ""reveal"" at the end is disappointing. First, it does not really match up with the set up. And second, by the time of the reveal, we pretty much know the why and that really undercuts the surprise. All in all, a disappointment.",0
5.0,History Lesson  Included,"October 24, 2018",Yes,I absolutely loved this book.  The history lesson about the war in the Philippines was so interesting although it had nothing to do with the main story line.  I read this book in one day and the only thing I regret is that I'll have to wait at least another year for a new Grisham novel.,3
3.0,Not worth reading,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I have read many Grisham books, and find most of them enjoyable, interesting, and exciting. Not this one. This is a book you finish because you started it, and want to see it through. You are not rushing back to it on spare time to try to see what comes next. At some point you just want it to end..There is one section of the 400+ pages that keeps your interest. Where he tells of the main characters time in the Philippines during WW2. Beyound that section the rest of the book is drudgery...The book ends with a twist, suprise ending. One, it is not that big of a suprise, and two, it is not worth reading the book for the answer.",0
3.0,Buy two glasses of wine instead.,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"This book spent a lot of time, and pages that were useless.  He is a much better author. He had to be paid by the page. I know this is a highly rated book but that is because of the author. If you miss this book you haven’t missed anything.",2
2.0,Unsatisfying payoff,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"Grisham is a great tale-teller and this tale didn't meet his usual standarda for vivid charactefs, twisting plots, memorable scenes.  From the beginning I only kept reading to find out the one missing ""Why?"" and when it was finally revealed -- on the last page --it was completely unrealistic and unsatisfying, and I regretted spending all that time with people I didn't even like, or hate, or learn from. I got suckered on this one. I feel like telling you the Big Secret, but tben I'd be a spoiler, so I'll just say: read the last chapter first, then decide if you want to read 400 pages to get there.",0
4.0,Great,"November 4, 2018",Yes,After looking at the reviews before reading i admit i wasnt expecting much from this book but im glad i purchased it and read it. Not his best but still a very very good read. I didnt see the ending coming. Many say they skipped through the war parts or found them boring but IMO those were the most interesting chapters. Grisham describes in great detail what the soldiers went through. I read thro the book in 3 sittings which for me is really good. I enjoyed his last book “the Rooster Bar” but this one is a step above it and a much better read than his other somewhat recent work “Camino Island.”,1
5.0,A Winner,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"I will be the first to admit,I had just quit reading John Grisham's  books for a while. He had garnered so much fame,till he basically could have written the phone book &amp; made it a number 1 best seller..Thankfully,I bought The Reckoning.What an amazing discovery.Mr Grisham, you have reached new heights in literary achievement..This book will leave you breathless &amp; begging for more..DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THIS IF YOU  MUST WORK THE NEXT DAY...ONCE STARTED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP..READ THIS AND ENJOY A STORY THAT WILL STAY WITH YOU LONG AFTER THE LAST SENTENCE IS  FINISHED.",1
3.0,Not your typical Grisham,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"Very different focus compared to Grisham’s earlier works. The central crime in the story is little pursued and finally explained at the very end in unsatisfying fashion. The real focus of the book is the lasting impact on the perpetrator’s family and how they manage through it.  The middle section of the book is a fictionalized account of the Bataan Death March and life as a POW and guerilla resistance fighter in WW2 Philippines.  Some may feel only a tenuous connection between this section and the rest of the story, but in my view it helps explain (not excuse) how a respected soldier and family man could become a cold blooded murderer. Worth reading, as long as one can put aside the typical expectations of a Grisham novel and focus on the different angle the author is trying to illustrate.",1
5.0,Always a compelling read,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"I have enjoyed Grisham since The Firm and the Pelican Brief. I enjoyed the length of this book and the detail. I found the details of the war in the Philippines and the exposure of MacArthur's stubbornness and mistakes,  which I had always suspected. I had a personal connection as my father participated in the invasion of Leyte. As always I found the narrative compelling and description of human emotion often moving. I find ironic, as I read his novels, his obvious dislike with most lawyers and judges since he is an attorney himself. And finally I always enjoy returning to Ford County. I feel like it is a real place and that I know it well.",1
5.0,Intriguing,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham, as always, tells a story so layered, creates characters so complex and teaches the reader so many things in a style uniquely his own.  You will find yourself wondering the true story the characters are keeping hidden and you will not completely understand until the final few pages.  I highly recommend this book!  And I suggest, as with all the masterfully crafted books from this author, that you sit back, read, and absorb every nuance, every detail, every lesson.  With John Grisham, at least in this book in particular, it is not about the destination, it is about the journey.",1
5.0,Brings alive history,"November 18, 2018",Yes,The mystery was slow to unfold but the wait was worth it.  Grisham masterfully worked back and forth between the past and the present to add depth to the story context.  Particularly intriguing was the vivid description of the Bataan Death March...gives you an ever deeper appreciation for our vets who have been in harm's way.  Also intriguing was the narrative around what the south was like for African Americans in the 40's...such a divide to be overcome as the nation moves forward in race relations even in the present day.  A great read...one of my favorite Grisham books!,2
4.0,A Strange Book from Grisham,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"This was a strange book. An interesting premise, an unnecessarily long middle section on the Japanese abuse of American prisoners in the Philippines in WWII, and a kind of quick ending which looks like it was tacked on at the last minute. I must say that the book was a page-turner in parts, and after withholding significant facts until the end, it had some suspense, but it just didn't seem like the usual well-crafted book from Grisham. Does he have a committee now? I sort of liked the book, even though it was depressing through and through, but wish it had a better ending.",0
2.0,Too much background info,"October 31, 2018",Yes,A m serious fan of John Grisham but this book falls far short of the standard set by his previous work. Dwells too much on background of the main character..Pete. Story-line is “stop and go”...jumps around too much.,4
2.0,Unrewarding and frustrating read,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"I have always enjoyed reading Grisham's stories.  I have found them compelling as well as informative.  Initially, this story appeared to be both as well.  However, after Pete was found guilty of murder in the jury trial, I was disheartened and disappointed.  But I kept reading.  Surely there would be some secret revealed or courtroom maneuvers at a later date, in time to reverse the death sentence.  I endured the far too lengthy story of the horrible Bataan Death March and WWII in the Pacific out of curiosity,  although impatient to get back to the basic premise of the book - that of the Bannon family in rural Mississippi..The war and imprisonment of Pete shaped the character of a true survivor who was a moral and ethical man at his core. Therefore, I found it inconceivable that he would have committed such a heinous and selfish crime - one that ruined the lives of so many people in his life,  Pete would not have dishonored his children and left them completely on their own.  He had missed so much of their lives already and I think he would not have given up the chance to be there for them.  And he was far too wise to have not provided for their future before he carried out his revenge - not just carelessly changing the deed which was never going to be upheld in court.  Above all, his sense of responsibility to all the people who relied on him would have prevented him from acting out his selfish need for revenge.  A man of such strong character would have found another way to seek revenge..I cannot accept that the aunt would have kept such a pivotal secret from Pete's children.  Joel would have pursued the truth relentlessly, not placidly accepting fate.  How could they have allowed their mother to avoid having to explain the cause of this terrible tragedy, no matter that she was 'frail'.  How much worse could it have become!.I admit to hoping for a good ending to the novels I read.  My  hope for some bit of redemption in this story kept me reading on and on, through disappointment after disappointment..In the final third of the book, I finally accepted that perhaps there would be no good news.  And then I kept reading to know the details of the fairly obvious betrayal that had to be revealed before the last word, with a little twist that was anticlimactic at that point.  Too little, too late..Finally, as I reflect now on the story, I just feel drained and unrewarded.  It was like reading a lengthy investigative report on a heinous crime.  Which I would never spend that much time doing.  In that case, I just want the facts.  I know the end result already.",0
5.0,"A moving masterpiece of war, love and life!","November 1, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham always seems to find the humanity in changes in life. This one breaks your heart in what war does to a man, his community and his life. There is always more to lose even once the battle is over!",2
4.0,Tragic story ....,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"While other reviewers commented that they didn’t like the part about World War II and the Japanese treatment of American soldiers, I found it fascinating (and horrifying). It is the entire backstory of this novel.  For those of you readers who don’t want to know about “reality”....in this case, the atrocities of war.....don’t read this book!  For everyone else, it is a reminder of history....it can’t be forgotten!.I’ve read almost all of Mr. Grisham’s novels, and found this one to be quite good.  As always, I look forward to reading his next book.",1
1.0,REALLY???,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"John .please..  do not read this book.  Usually love most of his, but this one ...no,no. Would not recommend this one",4
2.0,Mediocre,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"This book was really 3 books in one. Part 1 was the best, giving the story and trial. Part 2 was a horrid war story, which most readers should skim. Part 3 was a wandering tale with no great ending.",2
1.0,Not a good job at all.,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Very disappointing book.  Reads a though it were a book for people who were not very educated.  Much time wasted describing things throughout the book that were not essential to the story.  A waste of true writing talent.,3
5.0,Simply put....AMAZING!,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"Grisham has done it again!  A must read. Another wonderful tale of a  southern family, written in an eloquent fashion. I was completely immersed in the story - even staying up into the wee hours because I couldn't put it down.  I finished reading it in two days.  This is one of those books where I was upset that it ended - I would've been happy if it went on for another 420  pages!",1
5.0,A tale worth reading,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"This book is quite different from other Grisham tales. A drawn out mystery with the unexpected truth at end. Well told with his marvelous descriptive prose. It was the middle third that impressed me the most. At first I thought, oh no a flashback section, but then it simply amazes one to learn properly of the struggles surrounding the terrible Bataan march. I knew some of it from!y father, but no one that was there came back and wanted to share their experiences. Thank you John. It was healing to know more. What strengths and horrors men and peasants survived. Unfortunately, so many did not survive the cruelty in the South Pacific. Take heart readers, as the third section brings us back to polish the tale and mystery from  the beginning. A fine novel, like most of Grishams.",2
2.0,Too many details,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"I thought I was buying a typical Grisham novel, not a war story about the Bataan Death March. In my opinion, the Death March had nothing important to do with the plot of the book. It just filled up pages. I also did not anticipate reading such gruesome descriptions. Very disappointed in this book and will probably not be so eager to buy his next until more honest descriptions are given so I will know what it is I am going to be reading about.  Mr. Grisham is, beyond doubt, a wonderful writer, but I am starting to think he is running out of ideas.",0
2.0,Grisham Flop,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"I kept reading this book in the hope that at some point it would get better.  By ""better"" I mean this book lacked the usual ""can't wait to turn the page"" excitement so common to the majority of Grisham's books.  I am now almost 3/4 of the way through this book and frankly, if I don't read another page, I won't feel the loss in the least.  I'm hoping this is just a one-time hiccup in Mr.  Grisham's long line of hit stories and not the beginning of the death knell to his career, much like Nelson DeMille.  What a disappointment!!!",0
5.0,Amazing!!!,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"Once again Mr. Grisham has succeeded in weaving a thought provoking emotional story of how life doesn't always take the turns we expect. Also pointing out that those who appear to have everything have difficulties much like their counterparts. All that glitters is not always gold. A truly heart wrenching story that will make you race to the end.  Well done Sir, well done.",2
5.0,"Dark, dreary, sad commentary on life","December 4, 2018",Yes,"Grisham writes a slow moving, detailed family drama. It begins with premeditated murder followed by chapters of background information. Half of background describes WWII Bataan Death March - grueling in and of itself. The other half of background addresses generations of family life when white skin and black skin defined roles, servitude, and hidden relationships between males and females.  The ending leaves room for another generation to return to right the perceived wrongs. Or perhaps, The Reckoning becomes stand alone.",1
1.0,Boring!,"November 20, 2018",Yes,No story just long descriptions. The persons have little personality and it seems very amateurish compared to Grishams other work..Can't even finish the book - almost half way and it has been a struggle.,2
5.0,Another Winning Grisham Novel,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"This book kept me engaged from the first page. It isn't a happy tale at all; in fact it's all quite sad. But Grisham's lively, insidery descriptions take you inside a time and place that, fortunately, have (hopefully) largely passed, and thank heavens for that. The South has always been an enigma to me, especially the South of days gone by. Grisham's novels provide insight, if not explanation. In this one, I got caught up in the characters, who were developed less fully than the character that was the South. But it was enough for me.",0
4.0,Great book...take the ride,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"Gresham makes you work to enjoy this new novel.  Regarding comments from other reviewers of this book, character development was extensive and meaningful.  If you read this book, be prepared to not totally understand the plot until the last five pages when it all comes together.  The story is dark and will not leave the reader with the usual Gresham “ice tea and corn bread” feeling you often get from his down south story telling style.  Gresham is stretching his story telling skills and will take you on a long ride.  Read this book.",0
3.0,Disappointing,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"In his latest outing John Grisham has decided to experiment with, what for him, is a new style of writing. While this book does have a lot of courtroom action and this, as you'd expect, is very well done, the main aim of the story is to show how social and wartime experiences have affected a family, in particular the central character. In this respect it fails..The book opens with a murder and a trial. So far so good, although some of the detail is excruciating, every meal and ever cigarette they smoke doesn't need to be spelled out. It then goes into the wartime experiences of the central character. Mr. Grisham has done his homework on the Bataan Death March and the horrors it entailed. After that we're back home after the war and the story takes up again after the opening murder trial to show what happens to the family and the big secret of why the murder was committed is finally revealed, for anyone who hasn't guessed it in the first 100 pages or so..Unfortunately for this sort of book to succeed it is essential that the reader isn't just shown what happens to the characters, but is also told how and why it affects them and this doesn't happen. We are first introduced to the main character as he is after the war, then shown what happened to him, but nowhere are we told why or how it has affected and changed him. Yes, his experiences are horrific and yes they undoubtedly affect him, but it shouldn't be up to the reader to try and figure this out. The writer needs to show how his character has changed. Instead we have a fairly unsympathetic main character who basically stays the same cold, calculating individual throughout..Mr. Grisham is an excellent writer, but he is out of his depth with this type of novel.",1
5.0,Great Read.  Lousy Ending.,"October 31, 2018",Yes,I always enjoy reading John Grisham.  This book was a little different than his other books but it was a fast read as always and both educational and entertaining.,2
1.0,Tedious!,"November 10, 2018",Yes,So different from other Grisham books I enjoyed. Hard to get through the grusome parts. Story dragged it yet I pressed on to learn the outcome which was not as surprising as I hoped it might be. More interesting than the book is the wide range of reviews it received. It’s almost as if people were reading two different books.,1
3.0,Mixed feelings,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"I've read all of Mr Grisham's books and have really enjoyed each for taking me on a journey.  I am not sure what to think about this book. I feel like it is a few stories in one book, and I thought the way he told the different stories was a bit confusing and the initial story was lost in the telling of the war story. Then returning to the original story, which was kind of lost in reason for what happened, and I felt the ending was unfinished. It just didn't resonate with me, too much left unsaid and incomplete.",0
1.0,Not Grisham's Best Work,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"This is not Grisham's best work by a large margin.  It is a depressing book.  If you want to feel blue and hopeless, give this book a try.  I kept waiting for the legal drama to unfold in this book but it never did.  I am not even sure who the main protagonist is.  It could be Pete Banning and it could be his son.  Both seem to play a part in this confusing novel.  The book begins in 1946 with Pete Banning, a decorated WWII hero, murdering the pastor of his church.  No explanation is given for this tragedy until the very end of the book, and then the explanation is quite unsatisfactory.  If you are waiting for a big reveal, keep waiting...The middle portion of the book is a novella about Banning’s WWII experiences with lots of gruesome and gory details that appear to be realistic but bear no relevance to the overall story.  Grisham claims these details are an accurate reflection of what happened in WWII and they are credible, but they do not seem to belong in this book...Some reviewers have suggested that this book is about racism.  I do not see it.  There are descriptions of the conditions for African American in the south in the 1940’s, but those conditions, while repulsive in modern terms, play a very minor role in the whole story.  They seem to be matter of fact descriptions that are part of the overall background but are not significant in this story. There does not seem to be any racial tension in the book or any issues that engender racial discussions...The ending is very unsatisfying.  When I finished I wondered why I spent the time and money on this novel.  I should have reread The Firm instead.",0
2.0,Depressing,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"This is the first book I've ever read by John Grisham and probably the last.  The book dragged on and on.  Too many details that made no sense.  Absolutely horrible.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it was a well written story as far as grammar and the storyline was easy to follow.  But a truly devastating and depressing book.  Started out great.  Was so so in the middle and painful to read at the end.  I was glad it was over, but disappointed at the blah ending.",1
1.0,This Book is worthless!!,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"I have never read one of John Grisham's books before.  I thought is sounded suspenseful so I bought it.  This was absolutely terrible.  He writes like a ""guy"" and his female characters are a ""guys"" version of a woman.  How does he get away with this?.There is no plot, no suspense (you can guess the ending after the first chapter).  I kept thinking there was going to be a suspenseful twist or something surprising.  I found myself flipping through the pages trying to get somewhere that was going somewhere.  Toal waste of paper.  And this is the first time I've ever written a book review.  This is nuts!!!  Don't buy this book.",1
2.0,Too depressing,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"I wish I’d never read this one, as it was I totally skipped the 2nd part and then read til the end and got even more depressed. Nothing good to salvage. Leave it.",2
3.0,Grisham is starting to slip :(,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I've been reading John Grisham books for year. Have read them all..What used to be enthralling, in depth stories with highly developed characters and deep, intriguing plots have become shallow and slightly predictable his last couple of books. This and Red Rooster Bar were both disappointing, and left me feeling less than satisfied with the stories or the time I spent reading them..Every author becomes stale from time to time.. Hoping Grisham can get it back together soon.",0
1.0,Pass On This,"November 12, 2018",Yes,Very long winded. I found myself skimming through sections of this book. The twist revealed at the end also didn't ring quite true. Not a good book.,2
2.0,an utter waste of time,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"This book just went on and on, and then ended nowhere.  Broken down into three sections. The middle section all about war and a specific battle, and historically it is great, but as part of this story it is just filler. And then the end, anticlimactic isn't even strong enough. I have read, and will continue to read, every book this guy writes, but with this one, I am wondering why.",1
3.0,Disappointing Ending,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"The story keeps your interest because Pete Banning refuses to say anything in his defense and wants to die.  The story keeps stringing you along until the very end which turns out to be depressing..If you are not interested in World War II history you may want to skip part two.  If you are interested in World War II history you may find it to be the best part of the book; it tells about Pete Banning's ordeal as a prisoner of war, his escape and his service with Filipino Guerillas..The book keeps your attention but the ending is depressing.  I would hope that there would be a sequel to see what happens to some of the characters.",2
3.0,Not a 'page turner' like the early Grisham books,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"You reach a climax in the first third of the story and spend the rest of the time waiting for the big secret to be revealed, which it finally does in the last few pages of the book.  While the section of the novel that deals with the main character's experiences as a WWII soldier in the Bataan Peninsula was interesting, the rest of the story plods along until you reach the rather anti-climactic ending...Want to read a good Grisham book?  Reread the early ones.",0
5.0,"Roger Moore USA, Retd","November 17, 2018",Yes,"A close friend, now deceased, was in the US Navy and was captured by the Japanese while stationed in the Philippines. He was later transported to Japan as a POW and worked in the Hiroshima dock-yards, while imprisoned in a POW camp 50 miles from Hiroshima. He told me he was in the POW camp when the atomic bomb exploded - however, he stated that he did not hear the explosion. That's the story as I remember it. In addition, every conversation with him included the reward that he had been a POW! GREAT NOVEL",0
5.0,A book you can't set down.,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"A great and completely believable are of characters. A completely believable plot. A very well researched story about WWII that will hold your interest. A ending that you will not be able to anticipate. This is one of, if not the best, of John Brisbane books. This book is absolutely a must read.",2
2.0,most disappointing,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"I'm a fan, usually love his books but this one was 25 chapters too long, and waaaaaaaaay more detailed, etc., than needed to be to tell the story...It was long and drawn out and in the end, nothing surprising, no reckoning.....do yourself a favor and pass on this one, i wish i had...the only saving grace for me was the military history as it relates to the Philippines and the savagery by the Japanese, should be mandatory reading for students.",0
3.0,"Entertaining read, but a long wait.","November 3, 2018",Yes,"The book has 3 sections. The first section was riveting and exciting and the reader can come up with a theory as the events unfold. The second section went into legal mode and seemed to run in circles and seemed repetitive. The final section is the one you are waiting for to see if the reader’s theory is correct. Unfortunately for me, the end result of the story was anti-climactic and didn’t bring the excitement that the first section brought. Love the author but was disappointed with what I consider a lame outcome.",0
4.0,A VERY GOOD READ!!!!,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"The book was part historical fiction, part legal and part a good story.  What I did not like was the ending.  While I figured out what happened I was surprised by who it involved.  Today a defense would have been PTSD.  Read with an open mind and remember the time and place this all occurred .",1
2.0,Very Disappointed,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"I adore John Grisham, and usually will purchase his novels without caring what the plot is. I've never had a bad Grisham experience until now. I felt there was too much unnecessary information that did nothing for the overall story. The ending was absolutely horrible. I feel like he wanted to build a fictional story around an actual historical event, but the way he went about it was all wrong. He would have done better to just focus on the Death March and leave Clanton out of it. The way everything unfolded towards the end felt like he had finally met his page count per his publishing contract and dumped the rest of the story together and ended the book. I wouldn't say that it will make me never read another Grisham novel again, but I'll definitely read the reviews before I dive in.",0
2.0,Another great start only to disappoint,"November 26, 2018",Yes,John Grisham does an amazing job a starting a book. The storyline is usually a wow and with only a few pages in your hooked for several chapters! But then he loses his drive and the passion he showed at the beginning of the book fizzles. He starts droning on and on about things that really have no substance to the plot and contributes nothing but filler for endless pages. By the end of the book he finishes the storyline in a hurry with none of the jaw dropping page turning writing he had in the beginning. What a let down. I'm done with Grisham books,0
5.0,Another great Grisham book!,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham seems to always deliver a book that is difficult to put down! This book is no exception.  Thoroughly spell binding as he weaves the story of the Banning family.  This, for me, is one of the best yet...and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of his books.  Cannot wait for his next book!",2
3.0,Not a typical John Grisham book,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"Really struggled with this book, I just wasn't expecting this from John Grisham. Although, the story got pretty interesting, then the book would start dragging.  I was really disappointed how the ending quickly came about, then was disappointed I even took the time to read it. Gave it 3 stars due to I have enjoyed so many of John Grisham's other writings. Hope next book has more court room drama with all of the twists and turns he normally dishes out.",0
5.0,The Reckoning,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I hadn’t expected a detailed story about the Bataan Death March from Grisham but was very pleased at the historical facts I learned. I found myself verifying his dates and events and, well, he did some amazing research, because everything matched up...The story itself of Pete Banning and his wife, Liza, and children Joel and Stella is a sad one. But exquisitely written. Each chapter read will cultivate the desire to read the next.  Grisham at his best.",2
4.0,The Reckoning,"November 23, 2018",Yes,Extremely well written as expected from this author. The first section of the novel tends to drag a little but bear with it as the pace quickens thereafter. The novel contains a precise history of the Bataan death march. It outs General Mac  Arthur as the somewhat incompetent leader he was. His poor strategic decision making resulted in needless loss of life. His main skill was taking credit for valor performed by others. Overall a very good read.,1
1.0,Don’t waste your time,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"Starts out well—I was happy to be back in Clanton. Then there were what seemed like several million chapters to try to set up some good reason for the dastardly deed early in, but no... it was just a bunch of writing that did not end up serving the plot. The family secret died with two people and this took several more chapters of crap, each layer of which just started to piss me off. When the secret is finally revealed on a third ridiculously stoic person’s death bed, it’s hardly worth waiting for. You figure out half of it beforehand anyway, and the second half is stupid. And for alllll that, the evil people still win in the end and the innocents lose everything. I wish I’d never picked it up.",0
4.0,A good Grisham tale,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"This book is different than some other Grisham tales but with great characters and a bizarre twisting plot. The parts about Pete’s service in WWII are spellbinding and rich in detail. The bad guys  are deliciously portrayed as are the somewhat endearing family members, but this is not an uplifting book and it’s sadness is overwhelming at times. A worthy read for its description of the Mississippi racial relations and cotton farming in the war years.",1
5.0,Story spun,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham is a masterful story teller and this one does not disappoint. While some of his stories can be predictable, this one peels like an onion, showing the depth of each character, especially the protagonist. Packed with little known history along with the suspense, one is riveted to the pages in seeking answers and a better understanding of the human condition called life. Proof exists that nothing in life is guaranteed is given to the reader.",0
3.0,NOT a typical Gresham as you have come to love and enjoy...,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"Interesting story. A couple of ""time swaps"". Gresham is better with pure fiction and a 'Legal"" basis. The main plot of ""why"" the war hero kills the Preacher becomes quite obvious early in the story. Yes, there is a twist at the end. Didn't see it coming. Grisham indicates in the epilogue that the story is 'somewhat' based in fact. It is a decent read, but for sure not up to Grishams earlier work. His last two works have been a disappointment.",0
2.0,Disappointment,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Conclusion to this book is a depressing let down after a masterful job getting the reader to emotionally commit to the protagonists.  Downright depressing!  Wish I had not read it.,2
4.0,Great Read But...,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"Grissom's books are always a great read but exciting conclusion that this one built up to was anything but exciting.  The portions of this book that occurred during the Bataan Death March was both enlightening and frightening.  What the title character went through was miraculous and worthy of a Medal of Honor, an award that General MacArthur never should have received.  Grissom could have come up with a much better manner in which to end this novel.",1
3.0,A disappointment,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I am a fan of John Grisham, but this is the second book that has disappointed me.  Camino Island was the other..The Grisham books that I enjoyed had a compelling plot with lots of interesting twists and turns.  These last two books have none of those and, as a result, ae mediocre endeavors..Grisham has clearly changed his writing style or has engaged someone else as a ghost writer - either way I am not sure I will buy any more of his books",0
4.0,Follow through to the e,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I've read every John Grisham novel and have never been disappointed.  At first I thought this was going to be the exception.  Of course, I was wrong.  I gave it four stars because it did seem a little slow after the first several chapters, but when it picked up, it PICKED up.  As usual the characters are so real and the story line because of the time period in which it took place, believable.  After awhile I couldn't put it down.  The part about Bataan and Douglas MacArthur was mind-blowing.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I'm ready for the next Grisham novel!",0
2.0,Never thought Grisham would write a book I didn't love. It's here.,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"Based on this book, I'd say that Grisham has lost his edge. I loved his early work and most of his other works that followed. He can usually come up with very interesting plots and he is a very polished writer. However, this book was ""broken"" and cluttered. It also felt like I was really a considerable amount of filler. I believe in trying new things, but the format just didn't work. I was disappointed by Grisham for the first time. Sad.",0
1.0,Wow...what a waste,"November 11, 2018",Yes,"The author is John Grisham. This is NOT a Grisham tale.  Minimal legalities, page after page of unrelated history, and an ending that changes absolutely nothing",2
1.0,Grisham at his worst,"November 3, 2018",Yes,This book was not very good. I’ve read all of his books and this is by far the worst. The ending was predictable. 1/3 if the book was worthless. The book was about 45 pages of material. Not very good. Between this and the rooster bar i may need to rethink Grisham in general,4
5.0,Grisham offers a great history lesson in the midst of a mystery,"November 4, 2018",Yes,I enjoy Grisham's work and now believe this is one of his best writings.  The use of flashback to WWII in the Philippines was horrific and mesmerizing.  I briefly forgot about the first part of the book but then Mr. Grisham pulled me back to the premise of the story to the point I couldn't stop reading.  I tried to save this for a long flight to the UK coming up this week but I found I couldn't put the book down.  And the ending...wow.,1
5.0,An entertaining read,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"A man walks into his pastor's office and shoot him dead.  But why?  He never challenges his guilt, and he goes to the electric chair without revealing his why.  His family and the towns people are all left wondering why.  During the course of the book, the reader is lead to a plausible reason for this shooting, but as we would expect from an author like John Grisham there is a surprise before you finish the book.  Enjoy!",1
1.0,First John Grisham novel I did not like,"November 6, 2018",Yes,I am a HUGE John Grisham fan and have read all of his books at least twice. This is his worst ever and the first I would not recommend. About 1/3 of the book is spent following a gruesome (and quire repetitive and boring) World World II battle and the death march in the Philippines. Even the final third of the book - when it FINALLY returns to Ford County - is unsatisfying. The original idea and the plot for the book was weak to begin with and not even worth developing a full novel around.  The ending of the book - usually a weak point for almost every Grisham book - is even worse than ever before. I did not even know the book was over until the next page read Author's Note. Very disappointing effort...,0
1.0,It is just slow and boring,"November 4, 2018",Yes,I think this will be my last John Grisham book.  I have read most if not all of his books and this one will probably be the last.  What can I say but that it was boring.,3
3.0,Too many useless side story details. Too long.,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"First off, I am a Grisham fan and have read most.If not all his books. The positive is he is an excellent writer. But...Part 2 is unnecessarily long and detailed. Could have been a separate book. Had very little value to the story line. Took a long time to solve the mystery and ending felt like an afterthought tagged on. I would not recommend this book unless you really want to spend a long time hearing about war and torture.",0
1.0,"Gruesome, depressing, long and boring","November 1, 2018",Yes,I've read all of his books and this is by far the worst - save your money!!.Jim,8
3.0,Very rambling story. I waited for the book to get better but it never did. The only interesting part was the war story.,"October 31, 2018",Yes,I would not recommend this book. Very hard to get through.  I was hoping for a better story. JG is slipping.,4
5.0,Great Grisham Book,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"This could be my favorite Grisham book.  It takes us back to Clayton, Mississippi in the 1940’s.  But even better was the part of the book covering the main character’s service in the Philippines during WW II.  My father served there too and it gave me insight into that part of the War.  A good story.  The only part I didn’t like too much was the end.  In hindsight, I guess it was the best possible ending, taking the book as a whole.  Anyway, if you are a fan of Grisham, you will like this book.",4
1.0,A complete utter waste of time.,"November 19, 2018",Yes,This book is boring.  The first 150 or so pages should have been completed in about 25 pages. It is just a horrible written book. The last book I read by Grisham was just as bad and at that time I said I would never buy another book by him. This was a gift. How he justifies selling and taking money for this is shameful. He must have picked up something from the con men he worked with when he was in office. Save your money don't buy this book.,1
2.0,Jumped the shark,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"I am one of those who helped make this book a best seller. I bought it depending on the author to deliver another great story.. This book did not deliver. I forced myself to finish it. the best, make that the only good, part was the middle section during WWII.. I read the author's explanaition about how this book came about at the end. Had I read that first, I would not have bought it. Jim C.",0
3.0,Wake me when it's over,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"I have tried for a week to stay with this novel and just won't anymore. Not even the first chapter grabbed me, but I read more to give it a fair chance. While the premise could have made for a really good story, this one just dragged. I've really enjoyed Grisham for many years, but maybe writing more short stories, like in Ford County,  would be a better use of his considerable talent.",1
3.0,Late Plot Reveal Seemed Like a Gimmick,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"I am a Grisham fan.  This book was like most of his books, well written, interesting characters, interesting plot, with some important and interesting historical tie-in.  The difference in the ""The Reckoning"" was that the motive reveal was very late in a relatively long story.  Given the centrality of the motive to the whole story, and minimal treatment of the motive when it was actually revealed, left me feeling a bit manipulated.",0
2.0,What the heck was this?,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I normally love John Grisham, I have read most of his books but this time I am totally unhappy with the result. What kind of book is this supposed to be? Courtroom? WW2 story? Family Drama? The first part was kind of okay but then it went downhill fast. The ending was totally dissatisfying, with a number of loose ends and very abrupt. John, you can do much better - maybe write less books and do more quality...",0
2.0,"A war story, not a thriller","December 6, 2018",Yes,"The first part of the book, about a murder and trial, was excellent. But the whole middle is an excruciatingly long, gruesome, boring war story. It's somehow supposed to explain the motive for the murder, but that's really just an excuse to write a war novel under the Grisham name. After reading way too many chapters of this endless war war war war war, I just don't care any more. I'm returning the book.",0
4.0,Great story line as are all his books.,"October 27, 2018",Yes,The only thing I did not like was a bit too much gore about the Bataan March.,9
2.0,2 out of 5 elements to a story. 2 out of 5 stars.,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"If a great story has five elements to it (Plot, setting character, theme and conflict) Grisham kinda sorta got two of five of them. There's a plot -- though it's not very interesting and most of the book takes place outside of the ""plot"" just to take up space. It has locations. It has characters but they are mere props only there to take us from plot point to plot point. At no point are they needed, fleshed out or really very interesting. They have very little emotional impact on the reader. I sup[pose there's conflict, but it's never really between the main characters, nor does it really effect any kind of an arc. Waste of time and money.",0
2.0,Predictable and looong,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"As always, the characters were great, but the plot was obvious from the get-go and having read a lot of history of the Pacific Theater in WWII I was dismayed by the many chapters spent there. All-in-all this is a very thin book bulked up with history as filler. This isn't the first Grisham disappointment (after many years of sure wins) but it's the worst - I won't be first in line to buy his books anymore.",0
5.0,Riveting,"November 11, 2018",Yes,"This is certainly not your average Grisham novel, but I found it very difficult to put down once I started getting into it. I very much enjoyed the second third of the book and the historical fiction.  In fact, I liked it so much I would like to read some of the history books that Gresham recommends on WDW 2 at the end of this book. Although there is no happy ending to speak of, it’s still remains an excellent read in my opinion.",2
1.0,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","December 5, 2018",Yes,"I have read every one of Grisham’s books and have always been a fan. However, this is one of the WORST books I have ever read. If you want to even call what I did reading after about the halfway point. I was skimming and skipping paragraphs just to try to get to the end. The plot made no sense, there was SO MUCH filler that made no difference to the story, and it was just flat out boring. When you finally get to the end and find out the “secret” that the entire book is based on, i could do nothing but roll my eyes. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",0
5.0,I found this to be an excellent and enlightening book,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"I've always liked John Grisham's books and this was no exception. Unlike some other reviewers I did not mind the ""history lesson"" in this book. We all need to remember where we came from to appreciate where we are now. I don't want to give away any spoilers for those who have not read it yet, so I will just say it was well worth the price and well worth the read, I enjoyed it very much.",1
1.0,Don’t Waste Your Time Or Money,"November 23, 2018",Yes,"What happened to the John Grisham legal thrillers?  I have read all titles by Grisham without hesitation, but that has just changed!  I will now read reviews and seriously consider whether they are true legal thrillers that I have enjoyed so much, and looked so forward to reading.  The Reckoning was not a title I would normally read had I had any knowledge of the subject matter!  Very, very, disappointed!  I will be looking elsewhere for legal thrillers in the future!",2
4.0,What are you all complaining about?!,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"I can't believe all of the negative reviews! While this wasn't his best novel, it was still very entertaining and interesting. There was a lot of detail about the US presence in the Philippines during WW2, but since my father was a captain stationed there I found it quite interesting and tragic. Like the main character, my father never said a word about his experiences there. I hope he didn't experience what Pete did because it was just horrible! Good book. Read it.",1
1.0,Grisham finally writes a loser,"December 7, 2018",Yes,I have read all of Grisham's books and enjoyed them all until now.  He took 400 pages to tell a story which could easily have been told in 100 pages.  It was almost as if he felt that it was time to publish a book so he groped around for a story.  He took a good chunk to retell the WW II experiences of the protagonist which were of marginal relevance and definitely could have been shortened.,0
4.0,Better than the last few but not the best from John Grisham,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"I discovered John Grisham back in high school and he is one of my favorite authors. I've read every book he's written. I feel that for a few years now his stories have been more and more forced and less interesting. This book was an improvement over Gray Mountain, Camino Island, and The Rooster Bar, but was worlds away from The Racketeer and The King of Torts. I understand that he can't tell the same story twice but I am tired of being disappointed at the end of the book I've waited a year to read. I preorder every book he writes and usually finish it within a week or two of it being delivered, but anymore I do so hoping and praying the latest release will leave me speechless as his older books did..",0
5.0,Different than other Grisham novels,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"Grisham is my favorite author hands down and The Reckoning is in the top 3 for me of all of his novels. I prefer his books that are based in Mississippi, and this one is. It is different in the sense that it is broken down into 3 sections. The first section describes the case involved, which gets you hooked. The second second is more of a history lesson. I could understand how some readers could get very bored with this section. I thoroughly enjoyed since I am an avid World War 2 reader. I have read most of the books he used for ideas in this section. The third section brings the whole novel together. The ending could be a little disappointing for some readers, but I thought it was phenomenal, especially when you think of all of the consequences for a senseless crime brought with it.",1
4.0,Is This a Typical John Grisham Book?,"November 10, 2018",Yes,Yes and no. Yes because like all his other books the law and lawyers are involved. No because a reader could see the end coming for a mile. Yet good old John kept a surprise for the very end and it is a zinger. This  is an excellent read and very entertaining. You can get very involved with the characters but will probably not feel real satisfaction. The reader must decide if the end was enough.,0
5.0,Another engaging novel from John Grisham,"November 1, 2018",Yes,I enjoyed every minute of this story. It kept me guessing til the end! Wonderful back story and interesting characters.,2
2.0,Not up to par.,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Not what I expect from Grisham.  Story rambled and the end made me wonder why I had spent the money to purchase it.,2
4.0,An interested book,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story, but I was disappointed in the ending. The characters were outstanding and the description of the  Bataan Death March was excellent. I had an Uncle that went through  the horrible ordeal as well as a next door neighbor.  I met thinking as I came to the ending things would be alright, but  the story didn't have a chance to end any other way.",0
5.0,One of Grisham's top 3!,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"One of the top 3 Grisham novels, The Reckoning uses highly developed characters, vividly details the settings and brings to light tragic lossesfor the US Military that fail to be taught in much of today's history.  This novel about a time well before social media, exposes a new generation of readers to real community of people instead of devices and proves once again that conveniences and comforts may change but we still face the same enemies of shame, rejection, and jealousy.",0
1.0,Terrible ending!,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"As always, Grisham's writing style is outstanding however, the ending is so terrible that I would give it zero stars if I could.  I cannot recommend this book and somewhat resent the time spent reading it.  The main character, although a war hero, is a stubborn man who is easy to despise and deserved ""Old Sparky"".",1
1.0,Very Disappointing,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"Probably the last time I'll buy one of John Grisham's books and I've read them all from his first book. This one just plods along - too much detail, too much repetition. I couldn't even finish the book and had no interest in the outcome.",2
3.0,Plot but too much story,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"The full story and the surprising conclusion was good.  But there was way, way too much in the middle.  The whole story of the Batan Death March did not have to be told--in fact, most of it could have been eliminated with some sort of story of the time spent coming home and recovering from the war wounds.  Therefor, this book was not up to Grisham's usual compelling complete tale.",0
3.0,Disappointing,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"As always, Grisham is an excellent story teller always captivating  and entertaining. But his story was literally all over the map.If he wanted to write a war story great, but.to wildly switch genres in the middle of the book was odd. Grisham over the years has.had relatively weak endings to his books. The ending to this book is the worst ever and highly disappointing. The reader is strung along waiting for the revealing of a huge secret. Finally it is revealed in the last two pages using characters and events that were not mentioned or even alluded to in any of the previous chapters. Very strange and disappointing.",0
5.0,The Reckoning,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"This is a very differently written novel and I was not sure I could finish it .  It seemed sequentially ""backward"" the way it was written.  As I pushed through it I became more and more interested and did like the ending.  I think the war was a bit over emphasized and drawn out and even boring but all in all it was a good read for me.  Very different approach.....",0
3.0,Not too believable,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"The best part of this book is action that takes place in the Philippines during WWII. For a Pacific Theater student, this was an interesting and informative section of Grisham’s novel( since it was based on historical evidence ); however, the premise, although supposedly referring to an actual event, was very much far- fetched and stretched credulity.",0
5.0,Another winner,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"Given that I was born &amp; raised in the Miss. Delta, Parchman is a familiar place; I remember seeing the inmates sitting outside on Sundays and I remember the cotton fields where they worked in their striped uniforms. By the time I finished the book I was emotionally wrung out. The story was compelling and I knew it would not end as I hoped. John Grisham always surprises me. I have read all of his books and will be watching for the next one.",1
2.0,Disappointed,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I don't know where to start.  I don't like to step back in the timeline of the story.  That would have been okay except the part 2 was long with no build up of the plot.  At least he did wrap up the story in part three, except that the fact that the man adultertaing with the wife being black is no longer the shocking fact it would have been in the setting.",0
4.0,Sad but good,"November 5, 2018",Yes,I will read anything John Grisham writes but this is not his best story. Sad and depressing but informative in the parts about WW 2 in the Philippines. There was some legal thriller in it but not enough for me. This is not typical for Mr. Grisham.....to have so many unlikeable sad characters in a story. But I do like the way he tells a story. He gets right to the point.,0
5.0,LIFELONG SECRETS,"December 4, 2018",Yes,As always John Grisham has outdone himself. I'm always fascinated by the mystery behind his stories. His characters are realistic and the life events are something that could occurs in anybodies life. I enjoy how smoothly he writes and makes the reader feel like that are a part of the story. I am always amazed how he integrates his legal knowledge in his books.,1
1.0,What a horrible story,"October 25, 2018",Yes,What a horrible story.  Might as well read war news from Syria.,2
5.0,With each betrayal...,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"There comes a reckoning. A secret buried in the mind of a woman gone mad. This book covers three very distinct time frames in the life of a man accused of killing a preacher in cold blooded murder. What brought this war hero to do something so sure of ending his own life, and the problems it brought his family, make for a great read. A Grisham winner.",1
1.0,A waste of time and money.,"November 12, 2018",Yes,Don't waste your time or money. One of the worst books Grisham has written. It seems to me he has gotten away from his orginal writing style. This book is really an extremely grapic book about WW2. Didn't like anything about it. I'm so sorry that I wasted my time. Not buying anymore of his books.,2
3.0,Good Writing But a Poor Ending,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"As usual Mr. Grisham's writing is very good, but I thought the ending was unsatisfactory. It had the feel of ""I tired of this, let's wrap it up"". I would also say it was pretty obvious (to me at least) where the ""mystery"" was headed. I also didn't really think some of the action was very believable. Overall, in my opinion, not one of his best.",0
5.0,Extraordinary,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"I enjoy all of Grisham's books but this one is at the top of my list. A compelling story with historical events and an ending I never saw coming. Thanks, John, for writing another fantastic read.",1
2.0,Beware,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"This book is more about some desire to retell the story of the Bataan Death March, than be a legal thriller..Be forwarned if you are not into war stories.  The two halves tie loosely together.  With not much suspense ( you are told at the beginning that the motive will remain unknown) you are left to immerse yourself in the details of life in Mississippi following WWII.  Neither make for a satisfying read. It doesn't hold your interest.",0
2.0,Not Grisham's Best,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I've read all of Grisham's books and usually really enjoy them.  Not so in this case.  The book really dragged for me in the parts about the main characters involvement as a P.O.W. in World War 2.  The ""shocking surprise"" was not truly shocking and the whole book was just so-so.  It'll sell tons because of who the author is, but one would be wise to wait and check this one out of the library.",0
1.0,Disappointing,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"I came late to the game with John Grisham, maybe seven or eight years ago, although I had enjoyed movies made from his books much earlier than that. Ever since I discovered I enjoyed his writing voice, I've read a large amount of the back list and pre-ordered new ones when they were announced. This one was a complete fail in my opinion, in fact I couldn't even finish it. Life's too short and I have a large library of favorites to re-read when stuck for new. It's a shame, mostly because now his books won't be on my automatic pre-order list for sure.",0
3.0,Disheartening Read.,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"Actually three is a pretty high rating for that way I felt when I finished this book. Besides the tiny tale that was stuck in the middle of this tome, Mr. Grisham... really what was your purpose in writing this? The climax of the story is 1/4 of the way into it. Thereafter, I found myself plugging along trying to find justification for what happened through a convoluted plot of poor character development. This will be the last of your books that I purchase.",1
1.0,Disappointed again,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"There have been other reviews that will be similar to mine and I thank previous reviewers for warning me skip large percentages of this book (about 45%). I did not want a detailed and graphic war story of US and Philippine troops under siege by Japanese troops. I thought I was getting a legal thriller. Yes, authors change styles and topics but even the other 55% was disappointing. I have read every one of his books. Save your $14.",3
5.0,"The Reckoning is not an usual John Grisham book, but I loved it anyway!","November 5, 2018",Yes,"I love John Grisham’s legal novels already.  This is a departure from those, but there is still some legal involvement.  I could not put the book down during the part of the protagonist’s period as a prisoner of war in the Phillipines during World War II!  I could easily have read this book without putting it down, if I had had the time!",0
5.0,Half good half not,"October 25, 2018",Yes,My uncle died on the Battansp? Death March. I enjoyed the story mostly except when he was put to death. Have found that every other of Mr. Grisham's books are good. Guess this one was half good and half not.,2
5.0,Great read.,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"I've read all of Grisham's books and this was probably the strangest. It was like reading a Nelson Demille book. Long with a ton of filler. I found the war portion fascinating. The sheer amount of research required would be incredible. The story line itself and the conclusion was amazing. In my opinion, this is one of his best works.",1
1.0,Do not waste your time or money,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"I have read all of Grisham's books and have enjoyed all of them--some more than others, but always glad that I invested the time and money to buy and read them.  NOT this one.  It is terrible.  The first part builds the story and is pretty typical Grisham; the second part is a long history lesson that is torturous to read; the third part is the resolution which contains the most depressing and empty ending ever.  I kept turning the page thinking there had to be more after I read the last line.  This is an awful book--not worth passing on to anyone I know.  If I could have given it less than a ONE STAR rating, I would have.",0
2.0,Seemed Unfinished,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"One word for Mr. Grisham: DENOUEMENT!! Parts of this book were pretty good. Parts of it, not so much. Mainly, I wanted some closure on the surviving characters.  It didn't happen.",1
5.0,"In typical Grisham style, this story takes the reader to the unexpected.","November 17, 2018",Yes,"The Reckoning is a Grisham story written with greater skill at drawing the reader deeply. Into seeking the truth than any others I have read.  At each turn I felt challenged as my assumptions fell apart and when the truth is finally revealed I was stunned.  If you are a fan of Grisham's work, I highly recommend you read this story.",0
4.0,"Good, Bad, Then Good","October 24, 2018",Yes,"Not his best but a good read. Starts out as a fascinating “can’t wait to find out” Book 1, slows to a somewhat interesting crawl in “Book 2”, and finally gives up the answer on the last few pages. Speaking of pages, there are too many. Could have been done in 100 fewer pages but an enjoyable read nonetheless.",1
5.0,A must read! Don’t hesitate to buy now!,"November 22, 2018",Yes,A page turner I couldn’t put down..Perfectly encapsulates the sacrifices of GI’s and their families during WWII..A compelling story of one clan’s struggle to keep possession of their ancestral land and to piece their family back together; all while trying to discover life altering family secrets.,0
5.0,Grisham at his best!,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I loved all the research done on World War 11 and the actual feeling the people had for the men at war. The country was totally behind ""our boys"" and our world revolved around our participation and winning the war. Grisham captured the best and the worst. I loved this book.",1
5.0,Grisham's best,"November 5, 2018",Yes,One of those ebooks keeps you involved start to finish  Made the best sells list as soon as it was available to read..A real masterpiece with interwoven history of WW II.,1
1.0,Worst book by Grisham,"November 9, 2018",Yes,Overall I am a fan of Grisham and am anxious to read his new releases and am usually able to able to get through the books pretty quickly.  This was not the case with The Reckoning which was a bad story combined with WW2 history = my least favorite Grisham novel of all.  It was as if Grisham ran out of storylines which led to a history lesson of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines which had some relevance but didn't require a third of the book.  A disappointment and would not recommend.,1
1.0,"Grisham has lost it!  One of the worst, most boring books I have ever read!  I had to skim through most of it to get to the ending, which was extremely unsatisfactory!!!  I won’t be picking up any more Grisham books!","November 13, 2018",Yes,"Grisham has lost it!  One of the worst, most boring books I have ever read!  I had to skim through most of it to get to the ending, which was extremely unsatisfactory!!!  I won’t be picking up any more Grisham books!",3
5.0,Tangled Web...,"October 30, 2018",Yes,I couldn't put this novel down. I read for hours on end. The story was mesmerizing. I loved the way the characters interacted with one another. I enjoyed the depth of the characters &amp; the elusiveness of each individual..I learned new info about WW2..All in all this is a great novel. One you will want to read!,0
3.0,Take a Pass on this one...,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"Love the way Grisham writes—hard to put his books down. His legal knowledge and Southern setting bring his thrillers to life. But The Reckoning was not up to his usual heart-stopping standards. I kept waiting for something to happen but was disappointed by the ending that seemed anti-climactic. Yes, I constantly wondered “Why,” which kept me reading with anticipation, but this just didn’t work for me. Almost as if it was a rush job to get out another best-seller.",0
1.0,Not Grisham’s Best,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"I have enjoyed reading John Grisham’s novels for years. The Reckoning, however, was not the page-turner I was anticipating. Rather it rambled along without direction - words in search of a story. I do admit that I couldn’t bear to read the middle of the novel, describing Pete Banning’s war experiences. The scenes were too hard for me, so I skipped ahead to his return. (I typically don’t do that.). I read the last hundred pages or so and was left with a sad, empty feeling. By the way, I did enjoy the kid lawyer series and hope there will be more!",0
1.0,Very disappointed,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"This is the worse John Grisham novel.  The characters were unsympathetic and flat. The story slow moving with a history of the Vietnam Nam war in the middle that seemed taken from a boring history text. (By the way, I love history).I skimmed through the last quarter of the book because I really didn’t care what happened to these people.",1
5.0,Unusual plot development really works,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"Grisham really displays his versatility here, providing a WW II history lesson and a look at the social structure of the post-war South -- all part of an inverted plot structure that really drags the reader into the story. And there's even some legal stuff, just to remind everyone who's writing this. A well-designed, well-written page-turner.",0
3.0,depressing,"November 18, 2018",Yes,I love John Grisham and will continue reading his books but the ending of this book was most depressing.A sad sad tragedy!!  I'll stick with the fast paced legal thrillers.,1
5.0,"I recommend this book,","November 1, 2018",Yes,"Great plot, a bit of history added....however I pretty much had it figured out not long into the book. I feel it was one of his “easier” reads. I have read them all!!",2
4.0,Not my favorite.,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"There are really two stories here; the old South and Bataan.  I lived in the old South and John told it perfectly.  I knew a man, a doctor, Alvin Powleit, who had been on that March.  He was 92 when he told me of his experience.  I have read one other account.  Neither was as detailed nor graphic as this one.  After reading this, I have much greater appreciation of Dr. Powleit.  This was hard read.",1
5.0,A sad tragic tale,"October 28, 2018",Yes,Another great story by this author. Gripping drama told in reverse. Truly sad that a web of lies led to a family destroyed. Highly recommend this book.,2
5.0,Another Well Researched Masterpiece,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"Interesting, compelling, thought provoking.  Everything you'd expect from a Grisham novel.",3
2.0,A little dark for my tastes,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"As always, John Grisham comes through with a well written novel.  It was, for me, a very dark story with almost no redeeming features.  Although I appreciate its historical importance, I had to skip the long narrative on the Bataan Death March as it was just too much for me.  Otherwise, a sad story well told.",0
5.0,Back to Ford County = What Secrets Await,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"It is always s great read when John Grisham pulls back the curtains of homes in Ford County. Every time you ""know"" you have determined the plot and sub plot, you will be wrong. When you finally learn who, you will have to back and read a couple of pages again, because he slips what you have been waiting for, in to the narrative so smoothly",0
3.0,Author is always a good story teller,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"I faithfully have read all of this author's books, but was disappointed with this novel.  In order to obtain the answer to the plot set up in the beginning of the book, I had to wade through less interesting information in the book's middle.  I would have been satisfied just reading the beginning and the ending only; however, I will say that the war depictions were very well written.",1
2.0,So disappointed,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"I have read every book that John Grisham has written and have loved every one. Until... The Reckoning. I finally just deleted it off my Kindle after reading 59% of the book. I couldn't suffer thru another page. I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to another page turner. It was long, boring and drawn out with way too much detail and not enough to keep me interested. Sorry Mr. Grisham. Hopefully the next one will turn out better!",0
2.0,Too much coverage of the war in the Pacific.,"November 23, 2018",Yes,"The Reckoning was a big disappointment.  There was too much coverage of the war in the Pacific which I cannot imagine being of interest to women, and the ending reminded me of the old Twilight Zone series where you are totally surprised with the ending.  This is one of the worst Grisham books I have read.",0
5.0,Loved it!!,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I have been a fan of John Grisham since A Time to Kill. This book did not disappoint. The story line was engaging and kept me reading and interested. The characters were well written and portrayed. The part about the Bataan Death March was heart wrenching..Excellent story, as always Mr. Grisham.",0
2.0,A Lesson in Suspense Writing,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"I finally read a Grisham novel! Whatever may be said about the gross literary inadequacies of Mr. Grisham’s writing, his suckering the reader with teasers is not one of them. Mr. Grisham leads the reader slowly, carefully, repeatedly baiting.  He is so adept at baiting that I plowed through a hundred pages of the Death March in Bataan, undeterred. The same with legalese. I needed to know the ending “through hell or high water” and I kept going.",0
4.0,A Cautionary Tale,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"Not an uplifting story, but well told. Kept me hanging in there until the bitter end. And it was bitter.",2
4.0,Not the usual Grisham book,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I am a fan of John Grisham and have read most of his books. This book is very different than his usual lawyer involved mysteries. This is a very compelling story of a prominent farm family from North Mississippi and their closely held family secrets. A compelling read, although slightly disturbing.",1
3.0,A story that gets off the ground with high expectations but drones on without a climactic ending.,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"Pete Banning, a well respected cotton farmer, is home from the war. He is a highly decorated war hero who puts his wife into a mental institute and kills the local preacher. He gives no reason and accepts his fate in the electric chair. After all the build up the story drones on with less than a climactic ending.",0
4.0,I enjoyed the telling of this tale.,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"Great, interesting tale. A respected man murders the local preacher, but refuses to say why. He’s convicted and is executed by the state...Yes this is a legal tale, but unlike the Grisham we know. I enjoyed the telling and never guessed why. However it all makes sense when revealed",0
5.0,Stellar Grisham,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"The author shows astonishing maturity as he takes his talented writing beyond the court room and with much emotion, into the mysterious and often absurd ways of human nature. The prejudice of the South, the unjust burden placed  on the shoulders of children innocent of their parents’ errors, the innate ambitions of the opportunists, the prejudice of pride - all descriptions are full of nuance and everything is truly felt by the reader, the heat, the sweat, the pain, the anguish... As always, the reader discovers the truth only at the end and of course via a skillful twist in the tale. His best.",1
3.0,Decent but not great,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"Grisham, in my opinion, will never be a great author.  His first couple of nobels were great but he just doesn’t write well.  He has a terrible editor or he just never learned to develop his vocabulary.  The story was a great idea, but John doesn’t have the talent to follow through.",0
2.0,not worth the money,"November 6, 2018",Yes,I did not like the ending at all it was not nessary to tell all that personl stuff or reveal the person grisham said it was based on atrue story so still it was not nessary to reveal all the gross personl stuff about a womans personal hygene  I will never read or order another john grisham book and I paid 14.00 dollars for this ive read all of his books this was awful  this is why 2 stars,0
3.0,Not a typical Grisham book,"November 20, 2018",Yes,The first section was very slow moving and overly lengthy. The Boneyard was nothing more then a description of the Bataan death march and could have been shorter  I expected a better description of the motive. I did not think that even after what he went thru that he would kill a friend without confronting him. Very disappointed that he borrowed a story line and turned into  a lengthy novel that could have been a short story.,0
5.0,Page turner,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I had not read a John Grisham  novel since Testament.  I forgot what an excellent story teller he is.  Every character becomes real, history is thoroughly relayed and educational.  The story is excellent. I'm not a writer  so my words are simple, but this is one JG I'm glad not to have passed by.",1
1.0,Waiting for his next release and hoping it’s more of what we know Grisham to be...,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"I am in absolute shock. I am a rabid Grisham fan, own and read every one of his novels, and yet utterly disappointed at the thought of him allowing this to be published with his name on it. Page after page I kept hoping for improvement and turning the last I was left shaking my head. As other reviewers pointed out the entire plot is poor and not even close to being a surprise. It pains me to give poor ratings however if it was possible to get a refund for this hardcover I would request one in full. Don’t waste your time...wait for his next release and hope that it’s more of what we know Grisham can deliver.",0
2.0,Reckoning not Grisham's Best,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I was disappointed in this book. I read all Grisham's and expect an exciting court book. This book was in at least 3 parts, starting with near the end and moving to the beginning of the story. Very confusing! Very gory war parts. I wish I had bypassed this one. Hoping his next one will be true to form!",0
3.0,NO LONGER MY FAVORITE WRITER,"November 13, 2018",Yes,His last two books just haven’t been that good (Obviously my opinion)..The reason I did not give this one star was because of his compelling descriptions of Pete’s heroism in battle...I do realize that as I type this into my phone - JG has made more money on this book as I type - Than I will make for some time...I want him to go back to writing about David and Goliath. I love it when David wins.,0
5.0,John GRISHAM  Does it AGAIN!!!!!!,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"THE RECKONING HELD ME FROM THE FIRST PAGE TO THE LAST!!!.AWESOME!!!!!!  THE FICTION, THE HISTORY, I COULDN'T TURN THE PAGE FAST ENOUGH. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS A WORD SO I TOOK MY TIME!! NEVER DRAGGY. YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE END, BUT YOUR IN FOR A SHOCK!!!!! A MUST READ!!!",0
1.0,Graham misses the mark.,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"Court battles are handicapped by the defendant's refusal to share his motive. Too much of the book was spent on the battlefields of WW2 framing the main character's mental state, and not enough time was spent uncovering the events which led to the crime.",1
5.0,Don't miss Grisham's latest book,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I have read all of Grisham's books, and have never been disappointed. He is my favorite author..His chapters about the Bataan Death March made me further understand the unbearable sufferings the endured..And then.... There's the mystery. I couldn't put the book down.",0
3.0,Reckoning is sometimes hard....,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"Pete is a war hero, no doubt about that. Changes abound when Pete returns  home. I found the plot predictable but entertaining.",1
5.0,OUTSTANDING Page Turner,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"I read this book because the author writes great books. I only put this book down when I fell asleep with it. I would wake up later and start again. Wow. I also had a favorite read, The Partner, and would like to see these two books made into movies. John, you're the best..... Carole",0
5.0,GREAT READ!!,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"I enjoyed this novel very much. The brutality of the war was written so well you feel for the characters. The ending wasn't really a surprise, but there is a twist to it that I didn't see coming. One of Grisham's best.",2
1.0,Wish I could be it a double negative.,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"I am an African American PHD , I WILL NOT READ SUCH FOOLISHNESS, degrading African Americans as “pickers”  We perform major brain surgeries on all races ever day to preserve their lives. John Grinshaw should be ashamed of himself the way he depicts A A in this book. I will never read another jG book again.",0
5.0,Exciting read,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"I was thinking of this review the whole read. I was worried that the ending would not do the story justice. If you forget the time this story takes place the ending will be anticlimactic so don’t forget the story takes place in the 30s and 40s. And in the Deep South. Really enjoyed this book, you will also.",0
5.0,Susan Petrunya,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"Another terrific book by John Grisham. The present events of the story interspersed with the trials of the Batan death March and the horrors of American soldiers was brilliant. The ending was somewhat of a surprise, and as always well hidden from the story until the end.",1
3.0,Without the military career of Pete Banning... sorry to say this novel was a total ho-hum.,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I'm disappointed with the tedious, crawling of this story.  Very little of interest before and after the years of military service by our main character.  The last chapter was easy to foretell and anticlimactic.  However, this won't keep me from pre-ording John Grisham in the future.",1
3.0,Nothing good happens in this one !!,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"I was so anxious to read this new Grissom book , but alas , it wasn’t his usual ! In fact , it was a bit depressing with nothing of what I exoect  from him ., .. the twists, turns and ingenious solutions to a problem were absent . I still  love Grissom , but this one disappointed !!",0
3.0,Interesting story,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"An interesting, but somewhat depressing account of a violent crime and it's aftermath, in a small Mississippi town just after WWII. I was less than satisfied by the outcome. Engrossing account of the Japanese conquest and occupation of the Phillipines from 1941 - 1945.",1
5.0,A Story Of Family Secrets,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"I liked the Second Part of the book. The love affair, early years, and struggles with the land. Although difficult to read, the years in the Philippines during the war were extremely well written. I rather read chronologically and therefore I would have preferred book one being placed as book 2.",1
4.0,Good read!,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I enjoy reading John Grisham books, but this one was only good , not great. The way the book was written was what I had a hard time with. You give us this ending at the beginning and then go back to telling the story , didn't like this. It was still a good read though.",0
5.0,Another Triumph for John Grisham,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"I have never been disappointed with a Grisham novel and this one was no different.  Riveting.  Amazing story about a Man, a Family, and an ACT that changed every one of their lives forever-perhaps for Generations.  Order it, and then be prepared to be unable to put it down.",0
5.0,Couldn’t put down,"November 3, 2018",Yes,This fictional tale took place during WWII. I was sure it was non fiction as the story of the main character’s experience in the Philippines and the Bataan Death March were so vivid. In my role as a mental health therapist I once had the privilege of working with a survivor whose recollections were similar to Pete Bannings in the Reckoning.,0
2.0,Very long uphill coaster ride then 6 a second descent,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"I have read every Grisham book. Literally every one. We all know he has been off his game the last 3 to 4 books. However, within a few chapters of ‘The Reckoning’ I thought he was back. My hope lived but started dwindling 80% in. Dangling a carrot to your reader for awhile is enticing but not for 99% of the narrative. I had hoped Grisham would pull Pete’s war experience into the climax but my wish remained unfulfilled. Without this interweaving, the war experiences seem like a superfluous side show. This feels rather dishonorable. I will continue to read Grisham but I will stop hoping for another “Rainmaker”.",1
3.0,So so.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,Not one of my favorites.  This really was just too much.  Too many different stories going on all at once and not very well tied together.  I personally don't like a novel that goes back and forth in time and when it involves more than one person it's even less enjoyable.,0
3.0,Not your typical Grisham novel,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"I was disappointed. This a different kind of novel. I would have expected a different finale. The Batan Death March, very interesting from the historical standpoint, takes a lot of space in the book and is not directly related to the plot. Can’t continue my review without incurring in spoilers, so that’s it.",0
2.0,Disappointing Book,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"I have read everything John Grisham has written and he has always been one of my very favorite authors--until I read Reckoning.  The beginning was pretty good but then the middle section really let me down.  It was chapter after chapter after chapter about the horrors of being a POW during WWII.  I found myself just skimming through most of this as it became pretty annoying pretty quickly.  By the time I reached the 3rd section of the book, I was just turned off and had to force myself to finish.  The book was a big disappointment .  Hope Grisham's next effort is better.  I won't quit reading him in the hope that this book was just a bump in the road.",0
2.0,way too long,"November 17, 2018",Yes,This would have been a great short story or a novella. I love Mr. Grisham's writing and the story of Bataan was extraordinary and terrible but the gruesomeness had nothing to do with the ending. Too drawn out. Very disappointing for one of my favorite authors.,0
4.0,Liked the WWII History Woven into the Story,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"Liked learning about the Bataan Death March via the story line. Nice! Powerful..I did not like the ending or the flow of the story with no redemption or no forgiveness offered. Ended up very depressing..Could have tweaked it to include something about the infinite power of forgiveness, yes, even in the 1940's in the South!.Without ongoing forgiveness, really, life is hopeless!! Thus 4 stars.",1
3.0,way below usual Grisham,"October 27, 2018",Yes,The middle third of the book is a rehash of what we all know of the Bataan death march. The rest was way below his usual standards,1
4.0,Keep in Mind the Place and Time Period,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"When I finished this book I thought it was very well written and a good read.  Then I found myself thinking about it for days afterwards.  The subject matter was interesting but the 1940's in Mississippi, the culture and the people make this book unforgettable.",0
2.0,Disappointing book,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I should have read the readers reviews, then would not have ordered the book.  I have always enjoyed Grishams' books, but this was way tooooo much information about World War II.  The readers did not need this in the  story.  Yes, I was very disappointed.",0
5.0,John Grisham's latest book did not disappoint.,"November 14, 2018",Yes,I pre-order John Grisham's books and eagerly await their arrival. I usually finish them the day I get them too. This one had a lot of uncomfortable information about World War II and what our veterans experienced who were prisoners of the Japanese. It held my interest right up to the end. I can't wait for the next one.,0
5.0,Compelling read!,"December 2, 2018",Yes,A story that reminds us of the bad old days - in Mississippi and in World War II.  The detail of both physical and emotional suffering is shocking.  The ripples of consequences from a single lie will make you examine lots of your beliefs and comfort zones.,0
3.0,Too slow,"October 27, 2018",Yes,Good story line very slow in developing. I had a difficult time staying interested in the book.,2
1.0,Save your money.Meandering,"November 17, 2018",Yes,Another meandering tale. Someone needs to remind this author to stick to the plot. WW II? Bataan Death March?,1
5.0,Really enjoyed,"November 3, 2018",Yes,I really enjoyed this book. Was a wonderful story with great characters. Learned a lot about the war I didn't realize. Was a little disappointed about the and wanted them to get the land back but realize that was part of the story. Thank you to the author!,0
5.0,Great book. Lots of history,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"I bought a John Grisham's book expecting a good novel. I ended up getting a really entertaining book that seems more like it should be classified as Historical Fiction..I loved it, even though it was a different book than the one I expected..I'm really glad I read it.",1
5.0,One of Grisham’s Most Powerful Stories,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I have read everything the man writes, except Skipping Christmas and Theodore Boone adolescent series.  The Reckoning is among my favorites.  This is a powerful and suspenseful story of family, loyalty, and absolution told as only Grisham can.  His ability to weave a compelling and intriguing tale through the backdrop of early century Deep South cultural fabric overlooks nothing and reflects the simple authenticity that brings each character to life.  This story will move you in unexpected ways.  Highly recommended.",1
3.0,Disturbing book,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"I found this book disturbing from start to finish.  Although I realize that good writing is not always enjoyable and possibly disturbing,  I did not enjoy reading this book and would not read another like this.  I don't know where Grisham is going with his writing but I find his writing to be somewhat offensive as a Mississippian.",0
3.0,The Reckoning,"November 7, 2018",Yes,I did not care for this book at all.  I thought it was very disjointed. I usually like John Grisham novels.,1
5.0,"From the first page, he's got you hooked!","November 16, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham is the BEST! The Reckoning is Grisham at his best!.We are NEVER disappointed when we purchase his books. A man with huge talent.  You never know what is ""around the corner"" in his books. From Page 1, he's got you hooked. Bravo, John!!",0
1.0,Not his best,"October 27, 2018",Yes,It moved soooo slooowly and I found myself wish I'd not bought it. Still wish I hadn't. Don't waste your money.,1
2.0,Not a great Grisham novel,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"I have enjoyed Grisham’s novels over the years.  This was a frustrating read, as I felt the writer was building up to a big climax.  It didn’t happen.",1
4.0,Depressing,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"Grisham writes to make points these days.  This book is a good exposition of the Bataan Death March, but the story is very depressing.  Generally, the South in the 30s and 40s is depressing.  It's vintage Grisham with great dialogue and intrigue.",0
5.0,Great Grisham Novel,"October 30, 2018",Yes,This is one of the best books by John Grisham I have ever read. The story is compelling and I enjoyed the layout of the story very much. The characters were so intriguing that I just could not put this book down. If I could give this book 10 stars I would; it is that good!,0
5.0,A good read,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I enjoyed this book very much.  Good insight regarding the Bataan Death March.  One of his better books, I believe.",1
5.0,The Recking,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Excellent read. Enjoyed every page. Was very good and kept my attention through the whole book. Loved it. Excellant author.,1
4.0,Just to remind us...,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"This was a long book to keep my interest but very worth it. It was very difficult to read about the WWII horrors but we need to remember those sacrifices made for our country.  For whatever reason, this book really got to me. Perhaps how little people knew about PTSD we knew after the World Wars.",1
5.0,The Reckoning is a southern tale,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"This story could only take place in the South, a cluster of states that hangs on to the past.  States with a mix of blood and dirt under the fingernails..Graham knows the South and is compelled to tell it's stories. He tells them so well.",1
5.0,Outstanding,"November 11, 2018",Yes,As usual Grisham does a great job at telling a tale.  He is so good at putting the racism of the time in historical perspective and shining a bright light on how lousy it was.  I loved the reference to Faulkner.  I hurriedly await John’s next novel.,0
3.0,Not the quick witted novel Grisham usually delivers.,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Grisham's humor came through infrequently but always glad to see it.  I had trouble with the story and I think if he had directed it toward some redemption for the Banning family and brought in the reason for Pete's horrendous murdering of the pastor earlier I would have found less troubling.  The confusion with Liza did not sit well with me as a reader..I buy Grisham books every year and have enjoyed them all except the Street Lawyer but I can always re-read it.,1
1.0,Huge disappointment.,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"First of all,  great author.  I've read all his books.  Including this one, that I felt was a colossal waste of my time and his talent.  Terrible book, I finished it saying to myself.. what was the point of this book???  Complete waste of time and money.",1
5.0,Great Grisham,"November 23, 2018",Yes,Gripping historical novel.  Well-drawn characters.  Suspense and surprises.  . . .  Everything you expect in a great Grisham novel is delivered.,1
3.0,"Too predictable, nothing really exciting.  Everything pretty much goes along as expected.  Easy reading and fast moving.  Interesting, especially Pete's time at war.","November 1, 2018",Yes,"Too predictable, nothing really exciting.  Everything pretty much goes along as expected.  Interesting times, especially Pete's war time.  Easy reading.",3
1.0,On and on and on and on,"November 4, 2018",Yes,Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yah yah yah yah no yah uh oh yah what?,3
1.0,Disappointed,"November 11, 2018",Yes,Plodding....enough laborious insignificant details to make you angry you read the whole book.,2
5.0,Strong mystery,"November 25, 2018",Yes,This was very different from his usual books. A beginning that makes you think the story is over. Then you're into another one.But the mystery isn't solved  until the end. Keeps you wondering what the answer is . Highly recommend it.,0
5.0,Not your usual,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"Whenever you think you can predict a story's end, there comes a 'Reckoning'. Thank you Mr. Grisham for a delightful read! Although set in the 40s, this tale is a modern day version of ""things are not what they appear to be...""  And amen.",0
5.0,I couldn't wait to get this book,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"After i got it, I couldn't wait to finish it. I didn't see it coming. The end was not at all what I expected. It was genius.",1
1.0,A regrettable experience,"November 19, 2018",Yes,I kept reading to the end waiting for something good to happen.  The ending was even darker.  I read for either knowledge or entertainment.  This was a depressing waste of time.  I wish I would have never read it.  A very regrettable experience.,1
5.0,Surprise ending!,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Read the entire book thinking the preacher got exactly what he deserved. Loved the characters and the trip through the “death camps” of the war. Take a trip back in time with Grisham’s latest novel.,1
4.0,The Trues about the war,"November 18, 2018",Yes,It was a page turner shocking trues I did not know about But was slightly disappointed in the ending I was so caught up in the whole book and the end was like a let down I had already figured out what had happened to cause all the turmoil,0
1.0,Why John Why???,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"This was a mess. It's the last Grisham book I will ever read. The lot had the potential to make for a dandy read. But again, as has been the case with many of your books, this was a huge letdown. I think if your going to hook someone into what is coming later in the book, you should damn well deliver. What you did is akin to a carny plying his wares. ""Come read a spectacular story that has everything. Then, the last 10 pages or so will have you scratching your head. It was contrved. It was a disappointment. And for me, it was the last Grisham chapter I will ever read.",1
1.0,Grisham's worst !,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"I have read just about every book written by John Grisham and have enjoyed everyone of them immensely.....  except for this one..Hard to believe this is the same author.  The story is terrible. the flow is terrible. the characters are terrible. If it had not had John Grisham's name on the cover, I would have stopped reading about page 50, and now wish I had. What a waste of my time..",1
4.0,Held my attention.,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"Being born in the early 50's, I never knew of the Baatan death March. The insight and research of Grisham is amazing. His descriptions were mind boggling to me. The story of the Banning family numerous, loving and oh so very sad.",1
5.0,One of his best,"November 14, 2018",Yes,"This was not a lawyer story but a human story about a many who suffers through being captured in the. Battan  March, survives and his family has been reduced to smitherings...The history was marvelous more than the lawyers trickery",1
5.0,John Grisham's best yet!,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I'm a huge fan of John Grisham's writing and this may be his best story yet. His journey into historical fiction of the Bataan Death March is well researched and, as always, well written. He is a master at keeping the reader guessing to the end of the book.",2
5.0,Never saw this coming,"November 1, 2018",Yes,I always enjoy John Grisham’s books.  I loved these characters and was sick to my stomach waiting for the conclusion.  I never saw it coming. I thought I knew the truth.  I didn’t and you won’t either.  Great read.  Highly recommended.,0
5.0,Easy read,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"I found this book to be extremely easy to read as it kept me wanting to continue.  What one comes to expect from Mr Grisham.  Smoothly written, good plot and a few twist and turns.  Don't think anyone would be disappointed.",0
4.0,Read about important times in history that may add to your understanding.,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"It was a interesting writing method to explain different time periods and what may have happened.  I did not think it was close to being one of John Grishams best work.  I found it not to be a real page turner, but was a good work and interesting.",1
5.0,Grisham...Never disappoints.,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"Besides the legal twists and turns I always expect and love, this novel adds a look at war, a new subject, presented with the depth and reality always provided by Mr. Grisham. I read it in two days...my family's demands for meals delayed me from finishing in one.",1
3.0,Um a plot please,"November 21, 2018",Yes,I usually love Grisham novels but The Reckoning isn't my favorite. I thought the ending would somehow equal the build up we get of this dysfunctional family and the crazy decisions made by the head of household. I hops the next novel is better.,0
5.0,Couldn't put it down!,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"I've read every one of John Grisham's books and have never been disappointed.  The Reckoning is a great read right from the get go.  Again based in Clanton County Mississippi,  he tells a great legal story mixed with heroing stories from WWII.  I appreciate that while reading a great novel you also feel like you came away learning something...Great book!",3
2.0,Not Especially Good,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I read all of Grisham's books. This one wasn't so great. The story did not need the graphic depiction of the Bataan Death March, that was hard to read. And the needless sadness was depressing. Overall, I was disappointed.",0
1.0,Terrible. Don't waste your time or money,"October 25, 2018",Yes,I made the mistake of pre-ordering this before reading any reviiews. It's boring and just plain awful.,1
5.0,couldnt put it down,"November 5, 2018",Yes,didn't expect that ending at all.  keep thinking the preacher had something to do with the war.....interesting info on that part of WWII.  my dad was a seabee in the pacific so I knew some history.  good read and well worth the time,2
5.0,Another good read by Grisham.,"November 1, 2018",Yes,I like this book because it was easy to read and a book I could not put down.,2
2.0,"An entertaining story, but sort of without a point.","November 28, 2018",Yes,"Grisham can create great characters, so they compel the story along,  but I kept waiting for a reason for all this and it didn't really happen--or didn't happen in a convincing way for me.  It was kind of disappointing.",0
1.0,An insult to Grisham fans worldwide.,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"Please don't waste your time or money.  Page after page of irrelevant background, predictable, and painfully slow.  If you want to read World War 2 history, there are much better accounts available.",2
3.0,Typical Grisham,"November 9, 2018",Yes,Grisham’s characters are almost always richly developed as are his plots. There is an ebb &amp; flow to the stories that keeps the pages turning. Had trouble reading the graphic war details on this one. Not keen on putting this stuff in my memory bank. The problem I have with nearly every Grisham book I’ve read is the last several pages feel like he has a deadline to meet so he just drops the rest of the story over a cliff. This one was no exception. He should have done more “aftermath” story with Joel &amp; Stella. Ending felt empty.,0
5.0,One Of Grisham’s Besy,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"This is the first John Grisham book I have  read in many years. I could not put it down. With the exception of some of the section about Pete’s war experiences, I loved every page. I just thought that portion went on longer than necessary.  Great example of how one lie can destroy so many lives. I would have never figured out why Pete killed Dexter. Master storyteller.",2
3.0,Disappointed,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"I have read every book and short story John Grisham has written. If I have wanted to read a war story, I would have chosen one, not this one. I believe he spent way too many pages describing the war scenes, and not enough about the true story. Hopefully his next book will live up to his reputation.",0
5.0,"Intense and emotional novel about life in the South pre. and post war, with a family in turmoil","November 10, 2018",Yes,"The author does a remarkable job of keeping suspence in his writing as well as giving factual data on the war . Some of the story is so brutally true and hard to read at times,, but the story needs to be told.  A good read for those of us who  were alive and aware ...Sylvia Lewis.",1
5.0,Does Not Disappoint,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"My 89 year old father has always been a big John Grisham fan. He lives in a long-term care facility, and these days t takes an exceptionally good read to maintain his interest , and he is zipping through this book.",1
4.0,Always a good read...,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"But, dang that last page.  Abruptly ended.  I found the historical account of the Bataan Death March to be a real plus while reading the Reckoning. To see it through the eyes of our protagonist Pete Banning was especially enlightening.",1
3.0,Not his usual,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"I was totally engrossed during the first half of the book, then bored as the pace slowed in the beginning of the second half.  This didn't seem like a Grisham novel.  It was very hard to sympathize with the protagonist.  In fact, I couldn't really sympathize with any of the characters.",0
5.0,Outstanding Novel!,"November 5, 2018",Yes,A great story that kept your attention through many twists and turns from start to finish. Highly recommend!,1
5.0,His best,"November 1, 2018",Yes,I thought I had read his best book (I have read all his books I believe) but this is his best by far.,2
2.0,A disappointment.,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"I've read all of John Grisham's books.  This didn't come close to his best.  When it went anywhere it did so ponderously and when it finally got there , answering ""The Question,"" it fell flat on its face.  A Southern story for the 20's with little resonance for today.",0
5.0,A refreshing read,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"Great read, still has a legal system at its core but adds a great history lesson.  Highly recommend.  One of his best.",1
5.0,Interesting,"November 28, 2018",Yes,Part 1 and Part 3 is typical Grisham but the second part about WWII was different but did one thing for me. I immediately checked out and read about the Bataan Death March and the Philippines during World War II. I just want him to write another book to include Harry Rex Vonner. Always a good book from Grisham can't put it down.,1
5.0,Excellent Read,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"Another excellent book by John Grisham. Leaves you wondering about the main character, Pete Banning’s motives all the way to the end. It did not disappoint!",2
5.0,He hit it  out  of the park with this one!!!,"November 11, 2018",Yes,"I had  given up on  this author.  Too many books that were written with a certain formula. His first book was a big hit, but the last few I stopped reading. But I saw the good reviews and was at  a point where I could find nothing to read ( as a n avid reader of all types of different books) I found myself in deep despair!  I started at 8pm and just finished it at 5am. So thank you sir for a wonderful night of reading",1
3.0,not typical Grisham,"November 2, 2018",Yes,This book starts in the immediate past  then goes farther back in time and then to the present. There really is not a character with whom to identify. This is really about the Bataan death march and its aftermath. I would rate this book at just OK.,0
2.0,Not My Favorite,"November 17, 2018",Yes,I have read almost everything Grisham has written and this is my least favorite novel. The story has a surprise ending but it was arrived at after a laborious story. My suggestion is to read other Grisham novelsn,0
2.0,Another Good Reason to Despise Lawyers,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"Supposedly, this sad story has its roots in something that happened In Mississippi long ago.  It would have been best left untold. The story was tedious, the ending tawdry, and in the end, only the lawyers won...Not one of Grisham’s better efforts.",0
5.0,One of his Best!,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"Very complex. The story is demanding, not pretty, strong and hard to put down. Excellent character development. Honestly think this is the best book and have read all of them.  Might even read it again...soon....",0
2.0,Quite boring,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"You finish it because you want to know the solution; why did he kill the pastor? But it takes a lot of stamina  to read the whole book, endless descriptions of the death march in the Phillipines during WW2 and much more. After struggling thru the book the mystery is solved in a not very exciting way.",1
3.0,No one's perfect,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"While normally a Grisham fan, this book is not one of my favorites. I found myself wondering if this was a legal thriller or a boring tome about ""The Death March"". WAY too much detail about the war in the Philippines shoved into the middle of an otherwise OK book. Wish I had gotten this from the library...",0
3.0,"Foolish characters, rambling storylines","November 30, 2018",Yes,"Not a typical Grisham novel, as to me it tended to ramble.  The 'truth' was postponed past places in the story it would have made sense to be told.  I finished the book with one primary thought:  what a bunch of fools.",1
3.0,Nothing special,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I thought the story was interesting . Could even be true. I was disappointed that it was so very long and detailed.  Should have been about a 100 page book. Ah well, you can't always depend on any author",0
4.0,Very good but .......,"November 3, 2018",Yes,The best part of the novel is the description of the Pacific War in the Philippines. The rest of the novel is depressing and left me empty at the end. I enjoyed the story and as always it is very well written.,1
3.0,Disappointing!,"November 13, 2018",Yes,I was disappointed by this book..I think he has passed his sell by date..His last 2 books I read were just flat and predictable..Such a shame as he was such an enjoyable read in the past,0
5.0,"Well, he did it again...","November 4, 2018",Yes,"I loved this book and think it is one of Grisham’s best. I read some of the one star reviews. Some did not like the WWII portion. Being a history buff, I loved it. Grisham must have done extensive research to accurately depict the period. Many didn’t like the ending but I found it interesting and surprising. Overall, I highly recommend the book.",1
5.0,My favorite author,"November 14, 2018",Yes,Another fine read by Mr. Grisham! Three stories that all come together for a compelling legal story along with some war history. The worst part of this book is that it came to an end and now I have to wait until next year for the next book.,0
3.0,BIG LET DOWN!!,"November 18, 2018",Yes,To much about the war. Not a fun book to read. Absolutely hated the ending. Real big let down. Certainly not one of his better books.,1
5.0,Another great Grisham novel !!!,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"John back to writing great novel, full of surprises and twists and turns. The story will keep you captivated into every word and chapter. The ending will floor you !! A Must Read for Grisham lovers.",0
1.0,Big disappointment,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"I have read every book John Grisham has written. At the end of this, all I could say was, is this it?! The first section was riveting but the biggest portion of the book was about the main character’s time in WWII. Not what I wanted to read. In the last section, when the the main plot mystery was finally addressed, it was over in a few pages and very underwhelming. A waste of time unless you want a history of the war in the Pacific. Well researched and distressingly accurate I am sure, but a let down after the promising start.",0
1.0,Meh!,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"I beg to differ...not his most powerful, surprising or suspenseful thriller yet nor is it a murder mystery per se. It may be his wost novel that I've read and aside from his Boone series I've read them all.",0
5.0,A True Storyteller,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham, for me, has entered the ranks of being a true storyteller like many other southern authors. While the courtroom played large, it was the story of the Banning’s that captured my interest.",0
4.0,Southern attitudes of right and wrong among white families of the story period.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"The section of the novel detailing the devastating WWII events in the Philippines during the Japanese invasion and subsequent occupation. I feel the traumatic, but heroic experiences described during this section, specific to the protagonist, strongly influenced the tragic outcomes to himself and his family.",1
4.0,The Reckoning is perfect,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"A great story but I wish John Grisham would have included two more stories ; 1) more about Pete leaving his dog and 2) Pete's sister leaving her home to the African Americans that labored on the only home they ever knew,..",0
4.0,Interesting and Historical,"November 9, 2018",Yes,I found this book to be interesting and to be quite somber as I read about the Bataan Death March. I had discussed it with my Dad who is a WWII Veteran several times this book really brought it alive.,0
1.0,Don’t recommend,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"I love John Grisham.  I hated The Reckoning.  It was not a good story. I read, more like skimmed, the whole thing to find out WHY the main character killed the preacher.  It wasn’t worth the wait.",0
3.0,Disappointing ending,"October 31, 2018",Yes,The book has a promising start. Then it drags on with a gory tale of WWII story. Then back to promising us readers with exciting mysteries. Then comes the disappointing twist in the ending.... what???,0
3.0,slow moving,"November 2, 2018",Yes,Although I found the book interesting it was not his usual pageturner.  The crime committed was overkill  in my opinion for the betrayal which took place after the main character was presumed dead. Miss his earlier style.,0
3.0,And the point is,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"I enjoy books about the south.  Books about families and their secrets.  Books about ww2..I figured out the secret in the first part of the book, so I was not surprised or really intrigued in the end.",0
4.0,Certainly gripping,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"More than the usual Grisham courtroom drama, The Reckoning deals with some very ugly parts of the Southern history and the hellishness of the WWII Asian Pacific battles. This book is not for the faint of heart but is a thoroughly compelling read.",1
1.0,Don’t waste your time or money. Grisham is done as a writer.,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"The book was terrible - As mentioned by others, not until the last 10 pages did you learn anything about what really happened. It was boring, and I am finished with Gresham forever.  I have read all of his books but I’m finished-no more-as far as I’m concerned he might as well quit.",1
5.0,"A totally absorbing, believable and catastrophic tale of the South","November 2, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham again has succeeded in creating a tale that captures the convoluted and contradictory character of the South worthy of the literary hero of both Grisham and myself, William C. Faulkner...",0
2.0,Very Disappointing,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"After having read and enjoyed all of Grisham’s previous works, I was excited for his new release. This book is nothing like the others. Tried to stick with it hoping it would improve, but eventually skipped  to the end out of sheer boredom. The characters are dislikable, the plot drags, and the ending is predictable. Definitely not what I expected.",2
5.0,The Reckoning,"November 14, 2018",Yes,I liked the book!  At age 93 I lived through the times covered by this book. I would not recommend this book to some people; not everyone can accept the what life was like 50-60 years ago.,1
4.0,The high price of revenge,"November 9, 2018",Yes,"Grisham is a master storyteller and this book is one of his best. Although the reader thinks he knows the reason for Pete's crime, the truth is a surprise. The moral of the story, for me anyway, is that a terrible price must be paid for revenge and unforgiveness",0
5.0,One of his best novels yet,"November 24, 2018",Yes,Three stories woven together to make a great novel. If you know the Philippines history during WWII you will enjoy this novel into some of the background. Though in a some lawyer  and murder just great book.,0
1.0,Awful story,"November 5, 2018",Yes,The book is well written - typical Grisham prose.  The problem is the story - if you love a tale of tragedy without a single uplifting moment read this book.  ***Spoiler alert***  I kept reading with the thought that surely something good will happen to someone in this story but it NEVER happened.  Not one single thing.....,1
5.0,Twists and turns and secrets,"December 2, 2018",Yes,"What a twisted tale which began with one little lie. A very good book that kept me reading and trying to guess. The truth comes out, much too late, and it's surprising and heartbreaking.",0
3.0,Not his typical book!,"November 19, 2018",Yes,Normally I would give John Grisham 5 stars on this books.  I have read them all.  This one is a very slow read and not at all like his other books.  There is history in it.  I like more of his legal twisting books.  Hope his next one is more like the others.,0
5.0,Suspense at it’s finest!,"November 23, 2018",Yes,Grisham’s storytelling keeps you guessing why. The characters are realistic and the storyline is believable. This story does not follow the standard legal/thriller storyline. Outstanding.,0
2.0,Skip it!,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"It was my least favorite of all the John Grisham novels I have read ( And, I have read most of them).  War is hell and proves nothing. It turns men into killing machines. That is what happened in this story. Instead of finding the truth, and confronting his ""opponent,"" he did what he had done during the war. As it turned out he messed up a whole lot of lives for nothing.",1
3.0,Not His Best,"November 23, 2018",Yes,"The story is good and well told until  the  war portion. It is very repitious, and seemed to be written by someone else.  Some descriptions are repeated almost word for word.  Disappointing.",0
5.0,Wow,"October 27, 2018",Yes,It was a great book and hard to put down. Historical details of Bataan death march I was unfamiliar with. Families and their tales are often difficult and this was portrayed with finesse.,0
1.0,terrible book,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"This book is a hot mess.  you could razor out the entire middle section about WW II and it  would have no impact on the story whatsoever, saving you great amounts of tedious reading and leaving you with a mediocre short story.  I expected better from John Grisham.  He should  offer refunds.....or punitive damages.",1
3.0,Good,"November 5, 2018",Yes,This book grabbed me in the beginning and it grabbed me in the middle describing the Bataan Death March but the ending seemed rather simplistic and too long in coming to the inevitable end.,1
5.0,I never guessed the truth.,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"This novel serves as proof to me that lies can never lead to anything but grief and sadness. Of course, I realize it is fiction, but it could have actually happened. Anyway, I could not put down this book.",0
5.0,GREAT STORY FROM A GREAT AUTHOR.,"November 5, 2018",Yes,That was probably one of the very best books i have read.  it kept me reading and reading until there was no more.  great story teller and author.  i would like to enjoy more of his books.,0
3.0,Long book!,"November 26, 2018",Yes,Was not the kind of book I couldn't wait to get back to. Way too long for me. Very well written as always. The surprise ending didn't matter to me. I was just glad it was ending.,0
1.0,To read more reviews before buying.,"November 14, 2018",Yes,"It was the most disappointing book I have ever read.  If I had wanted to read a war story, I would have bought one.  I wasted $14...Mickey Hamilton",2
1.0,A chore to read.,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"A chore to read. Wooden dialog, zero character development, lacks insight into the culture of that area and era. A story without a soul. I was glad to finish it.",1
5.0,Intriguing Tale,"November 12, 2018",Yes,John Grisham new novel with a curious cast of folks. weaving an intriguing plot whose web involves all the characters interesting ever changing table that captures your interest and curiouosity immediately.,0
3.0,Not Grisham's best.,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"Well written story but it was a little depressing for me.  The beginning was slow, however the action picked up as the story told of the service history of the ""War Hero."" I have read all of Grisham's books and I was disappointed in this book.",0
4.0,A well written story- most Grisham-like,"November 16, 2018",Yes,Really liked the book and the interesting switch of backstory. Very well written like Grisham as usual..Probably not a book to read if you expect a Hallmark like story ending.,0
1.0,Pitiful,"November 3, 2018",Yes,How disappointing.,5
3.0,Not his best,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I always wait for his novels with baited breath. This one was not worth waiting for, in my opinion. The info on the Bataan death march was interesting, the rest of it was depressing and rather pointless.",1
3.0,Well written but not a great story line,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"Well enough written, good background descriptions, but not a particularly great plot not engrossing characters - middle section on Bataan was extraordinarily well done as an isolated piece",0
4.0,Different,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"I've ready Grisham book written.  This was very much his usual excellent style.  One thing for sure, it's a page turner!  At one point I thought it was going to be his best.",0
4.0,A First Class thriller with an unexpected ending (of course).,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"A good read and a page turner. It was exciting because the reader wants to know how it will end, but the ending is a real surprise, Very good, but for me not Grisham's best.",0
1.0,Absolutely Horrible,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"I find it hard to believe that Grisham would deliver a history book like this! If you want to read one man's opinion of WWII activities, this ought to be right up your alley.",0
5.0,Excellence- the man can tell a story,"November 22, 2018",Yes,I have read every Grisham book written and place “A Time to Kill” in my top ten. I love a good story that is supported by strong characters and this is in that wheel house.,0
5.0,Recommended - you won’t be able to put it down.,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"A hero, his beautiful wife, the Bataan Death March, his return and an unexplainable murder of the local Methodist Minister. Not a who dunnit but more of a why dunnit. The answers are buried in the convoluted plot line and you won’t solve it without reading the entire story.",0
3.0,"Not Grishsm’s Best, but ok","November 20, 2018",Yes,I have read most of Grisham’s work. He is an outstanding and entertaining author. This book just left me feeling like I had wasted my time. I read it anticipating it would get better but it just stayed at about a three star rating in my opinion..It was just an ok read.,0
5.0,A passionate story that will Remain with me for a while,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"Wow, words fail me reading the beginning that was really the ending and then finding some semblance of reasoning somewhere in the middle as the END unfolded.  Brilliant John Grisham as you always are.  BRAVO!!",0
1.0,A shaggy dog story of the first order,"November 4, 2018",Yes,I can't believe this is Grisham. An empty plot with much rehash working up to a completely anticlimactic ending.,4
4.0,Truth?,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"I expected something special from Grisham  and was not disappointed. Folksy and compelling, the Banning family grabs the attention and doesn't let go until the truth runs out.",0
5.0,Another page turner,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"I could not put the book down.  In typical Grisham style, the reader is drawn into the tragedies of life.A great read, with a thought provoking ending.",1
3.0,Disappointing with brutal factual details,"November 25, 2018",Yes,I did not enjoy this as much as most Grisham novels. Lengthy chapters full of brutal details of the suffering of soldiers in WWII. The ending seemed anti-climactic to me.,0
4.0,Excellent,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"As usual, this book by Grisham is a wonderdul story. The path to the conclusion is long and winded (sometimes it seems a bit too long) but reading Grisham is always fun.",0
5.0,An Excellent Story From the Master,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"The most different, unique book ever written by John Grisham.  This is a true tragedy involving a family, a way of life and mistakes made along the way of a man coming home.",0
1.0,Not one of his finest,"December 1, 2018",Yes,I have always enjoyed John Grisham's books - all of them until this one.  It's graphically violent and is in large part about what happened on the Bataan death march and to the soldiers during and afterward.  The story woven around it is not constructed as well as many of his other stories and the end is abrupt and disappointing. Definitely not what I expected and I wish I could get my money back.,0
4.0,"Good, but not his greatest.","November 28, 2018",Yes,"The plot was interesting, but slow to develop. The punch is at the end....Good characters, well developed. I liked it, but I have liked some of his other work better.",0
4.0,How the times have changed...,"November 9, 2018",Yes,This story is set in the 1940’s. It tells the story of a farmer and his family.  The issues of the times were told in this story and spun a family into deceit and turmoil.,0
2.0,Terribly boring,"November 4, 2018",Yes,This book was very predictable. The ending was obvious from the beginning. There was way too much time spent on the details of the court proceedings. I'm not even sure why I'm giving it two stars. I feel like i wasted my time and money.,2
1.0,This was poorly put together.  I love his books but this one I wish I would have passed on,"November 12, 2018",Yes,Book was poorly put together.  Not anything like his other books everything was really random.  I don’t recommend it. At,3
5.0,Brilliant,"November 13, 2018",Yes,I had to keep reading to find out Why. You have to see the book to know. What a story. The war scenes from the Philippines kept me awake..Don't miss this one.,0
5.0,One of his best,"November 27, 2018",Yes,This is one of John Grisham best novels. The part about the Bataan death march was fascinating. The story kept me interested until the end. I could not put it down.,1
5.0,Great read,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"Grisham’s best in a while.  Engaging and educational with insight into the horrors of war that few, myself included, can even imagine.  Beyond the enjoyment of the novel, I’m reminded of my appreciation of “the greatest generation”, and how far we’ve fallen as a people from the heroism and strength of those before us...",1
4.0,Compelling,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"From first page on, could not put it down.  However, the story disturbed me.",1
5.0,John Grisham...but different,"November 14, 2018",Yes,"This was a great book, but it's not a normal Grisham book where everything comes out right with a surprise win at the end.  There is a surprise at then end, but it's not a win for anyone.  He takes a turn partway through the book to a very interesting part of WWII.  Read the book.  Just don't expect ""The Firm""",0
4.0,Another Grisham gem.,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham is known for having an unexpected twist at the end of his novels, and he inserted one here.  His plot was well conceived, his characters colorful and believable.  My only reason for not giving this a ""5"" is my personal comparison to what I consider his best book, ""The Testament.""",0
5.0,First class story,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"The story line while excellent,  is surrounded by accurate and detail rich narrative of life in the south, pre LBJ. The re is more to the story than a pissed off veteran.",0
1.0,worst book ever,"November 20, 2018",Yes,I don't understand Grisham  He writes many very good books and then he writes one like this. A total disaster,1
4.0,A different kind of story from John.,"November 11, 2018",Yes,A riveting tale with a twist that I didn't expect. The war stories that made up the midst of the story were incredible and hard to imagine going through. Highly recommended.,1
4.0,Grisham with history,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"I occasionally read Grisham and this was a good one. A nice little mystery enve!oped in a WWII histour, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The ending is quite abrupt.",1
5.0,Brutal descriptions of war and dying,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Grisham has again held my interest with a story deep with background and secrets.  The ending surprises.  Don't even try to guess the motivation for the murder that opens the tale.,1
5.0,Another winner!,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"Grisham does it again! As always, compelling and surprising. Informative re Batman. Great character descriptions. A definite John Grisham masterpiece!",1
5.0,Great read,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"John Grisham never fails to surprise me! I love the way this book was written. Family history, secrets, murder, war and trials. A sad family story. A great read!",0
4.0,"Compelling history , slow plot.","November 28, 2018",Yes,"Grisham writes a compelling story ranging from the cotton fields of the Mississippi delta to the death match on Bataan. I found the movement to be a bit plodding and the denouement, while an unexpected twist, a bit of a let down. I am a devoted Grisham fan and waited eagerly to read his latest but would not rate this among his best. The plot seems held little suspense while the history is interesting.",1
5.0,"A Do not miss Grisham at his best, ""The Reckoning""","November 15, 2018",Yes,Grisham writing at his best as far as I am concerned. Held my interest and I learned a lot. He wrote of his characters so fully that you just felt thru those words who they were and how their lives connected.,0
5.0,Very Iffy,"November 5, 2018",Yes,My least favorite of his novels. Skimmed through most of it after chapter one just to get to end. Liked the characters didn't care for the back and forth,1
5.0,A deeply moving trip back in time. Must read,"November 15, 2018",Yes,Total departure for Grisham but absolute page turner. Extremely difficult in parts as an important part of our history is examined in depth. A must read.,1
5.0,Spell bounding,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"Couldn't put the book down. It keeps you interested until the very last page. However there was a bit too much about the war, even though it should not be forgotten, it got to be a little too much info for this novel.",0
4.0,Backwards?,"November 17, 2018",Yes,Good read. Historical fiction. But it is written backwards. Maybe John Grisham does with other books. I don't remember reading any other Grisham novels.,0
2.0,Disappointed,"November 11, 2018",Yes,The book started out great but went into too much length about the main character's life in the military. Fizzled out and burned. Very boring and to lengthy.,0
1.0,Pass on this one.,"November 3, 2018",Yes,Impossible to plow through. I gave up at the half way point. First review I have ever written.,4
4.0,A typically entertaining Grisham novel.,"November 17, 2018",Yes,This was a typically entertaining Grisham novel.  I enjoyed as I have enjoyed all of his works.  It lagged a little at points but the end of the book sewed everything together …. as always.  A good read.  I recommend it.,0
4.0,A story without promise,"November 6, 2018",Yes,I am disappointed with this book. Except for the Battan Death March why did Grisham write such a long meaningless book? Wish he concentrates on Legal issues.,0
1.0,Depressing read,"December 1, 2018",Yes,"I usually like all books by John Grisham, but not this one. It was weighted down with too much history of the Bataan campaign. I skipped over the entire second part of the book. The characters were uninspiring. At the end , I felt  nothing for them, plus a  depressing end. Very disappointing.",0
5.0,So well written,"November 29, 2018",Yes,I chose the rating because of the in-depth history lesson and the awesome writing. For me in particular it was very sad. So sad I had to put it aside at times. But if you love history don’t deny yourself this story.,1
2.0,Depressing,"October 30, 2018",Yes,This  book  is  very  dark . This  is  especially  true  of  the  chapters  related  to  WW 11 and  the  Bataan  death march. Would  not  recommend .,1
2.0,Boring storyline,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"Probably Grisham’s worst book yet. I loved the older Grisham books, but haven’t really cared for the last few...and this one was the worst. Boring story.",0
5.0,Captivating !,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"As usual, Grisham does not disappoint.  This book provides  wonderful stories while giving the reader an accurate portrayal of the horrors of World War II.  Once you start reading, you will not want to put it down.  Great character development.  As you read, your mind can envision each person, each experience, each location.  Captivating !!",1
2.0,"If this was his first book, he'd never get it published","November 16, 2018",Yes,"This book starts with a great plot line - why did he do it?  It builds for a couple of chapters, then meanders and meanders.  Then a whole new story starts to take place that's actually more interesting, but far less related to the plot. Then the two stories are tied together at the end, almost as an afterthought.  Grisham had a great story line but unfortunately it fell flat.",0
5.0,Southern sadness,"November 22, 2018",Yes,Riveting story w multi layered players.  Another time in what seems to modern readers another world.  History comes alive as we walk thru the past,0
5.0,Another great novel by John Grisham,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"I'm not finished yet but, so far it's been surprising with it's twist &amp; turns. Grisham always seems to have the knack of putting the reader right into the story.",0
5.0,Another Great Novel by John Grisham!,"December 4, 2018",Yes,Wow! I had no idea how truly rough the war was. Some of that was really hard to read. The story of John and Liza was fascinating and heartbreaking.,1
4.0,Great WWII story,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"The war story is great and based in well researched fact. However the two sections on the present day are a bit slow. When the ending is revealed it felt a bit anti-climactic.  It could have been excellent, but it just misses.",0
5.0,Action and Courtroom Drama,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"This was a great book that kept you on the edge of your seat. Not only a courtroom drama, but a detailed look at the Bataan Death March. It kept me in doubt until the end as to who did what to whom.",0
4.0,Different for Grisham,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"This book had so much interesting historical information about the war, and snatches of the south in the days of to kill a mockingbird, and yet it's its own tale. Some is predictable, some not, but certainly a contagious read.",0
5.0,Captivating,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"Although I was never sure of the outcome, I had some issues with certain points. When I read the truths, I recognized the hook. Careful, you may lose some sleep!",0
3.0,Not His Best,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"Grisham seems to be running out of new ideas, but finds himself obligated to write a book a year. This one is totally predictable. Half of it is a borrowed history of the Bataan Death March and related WWII activities in the Philippines, which just seems like filler. If you don't figure out the mystery early on, you aren't trying very hard. Grisham can and has written great stories.  This isn't one.",1
5.0,Very good book from Grisham,"November 28, 2018",Yes,I have to admit I so wanted to go to the end of The Reckoning and see what happened but I did not. I happened to see him on television discussing the book and saying you will be tempted to do that,0
5.0,Thus story is heavy,"November 7, 2018",Yes,Best book to date. Be aware spoilers coming.Murder. There needs to be a part 2 so we can find out if jupe is joel or stella's dad nd not pete.,0
3.0,Not a legal thriller.,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"If you’re interested in the Philippine battles of WWII you will like this. Although interesting, it was too much and it  seemed like the ending was",0
5.0,surprise!,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"John continues to develop plots that are not easy to predict. Outcomes usually are surprising and looking back thru the story, you can define the clues put there by the author. thanks John",0
5.0,What you don't know can hurt you.,"November 17, 2018",Yes,I love every book John Grisham  writes. The only thing I don't like is when they end..This was so good I was torn between reading all night or putting it down to make it last longer.,0
5.0,A Persistent Route to a Distant End,"November 5, 2018",Yes,What with flashbacks and time frames I am hard pressed to imagine filming this book.  But a seat gripper it is.  Another Grisham triumph.,1
4.0,"If you like Grisham, then get it","November 11, 2018",Yes,Good twist. Good factual war story as well as legal stuff.  Strings you along for the main reveal and then it doesn’t deliver. Or did it?,0
5.0,I loved the book,"November 1, 2018",Yes,I always enjoy John Grisham' s books. I can't wait until the newest one comes out. A wonderful read as always,1
2.0,So disappointing,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"As a Grisham fan, this may be his most self-indulgent work. Part 2 entirely about WW2 in the Philippines. I have read non-fiction on the Bataan Death March, didn't need to see it take up one-third of this book when it absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Only one question remains unanswered and it is revealed in the last few pages. And the book then ends. The End. What a disappointing waste of time.",0
5.0,Fantastic story,"November 28, 2018",Yes,"I was totally taken in , I was certain that the preacher was the culprit and I wanted the truth to be brought to light, but the truth went much further and deeper than I expected. This was a great read, a spell binding story that pulls you in and then blows you away",0
5.0,The dead.tell no tales,"October 27, 2018",Yes,A long winding road with twists and turns.  Leaves you hanging till the final end. Good read but certainly not as goose as the past John Grisham.,0
1.0,Miserable story told miserably,"November 19, 2018",Yes,I read and appreciate all Grisham books but this one was a painful read. It was basically a bunch of separate stories only partially told. The whole book gets wrapped up in the last two pages and you realize you just wasted a bunch of time.,1
2.0,The Reckoning,"November 17, 2018",Yes,Usually love Grisham; but this book did not pass with me.  Do not like knowing the end before the story.  It was a.depressing story.,0
4.0,GREAT READ,"November 17, 2018",Yes,I really like this author. This book was very good not as good as some of his I have read but still very good. I would recommend it.,0
5.0,It's the Usual...,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"It's the usual excellent book by Grisham. Any book he writes, I'm going to read. This one was spell binding with a twist at the end.",0
3.0,Not his best work,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"Dragged on too many time with needless info. I liked that it was broken down in three parts. Middle part, way to much information, got boring.",0
4.0,W,"November 30, 2018",Yes,"I liked that you couldn’t solve the question till the end.....the POW chapters were hard to read, so descriptive ...would have liked the wife’s character to be developed more.",0
5.0,Not really a legal thriller,"November 15, 2018",Yes,Although This is not your typical John Grisham legal thriller. It’s definitely a thriller with some legal tension involved. Thoroughly enjoyed it totally shocked by the climax.,0
4.0,Good read,"December 1, 2018",Yes,"This novel reminds me of the old John Grisham, the one who wrote a really good ""lawyer"" novel.  I really enjoyed reading this one.",0
5.0,Unique Grisham,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"Not the same type of courtroom drama, but classic Grisham. The level of detail he gives us on a period in history that many of you never heard of was wonderful!",0
1.0,Disappointed,"November 27, 2018",Yes,I really like John Grisham's work.  It pains me to say this book was not worth the read.  I usually buzz right through his books.  This was a struggle.  Hopefully next time is better.,0
5.0,Truly a Reckoning!,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"I couldn’t put this book down! I had to keep reading because I had to know Pete’s reason. The parts about the war were terrible! I hope much of it was fiction, not facts.",0
2.0,Very disappointed!,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I thought it was a boring read. Very repetitious, not suspenseful.",1
5.0,Never,"November 23, 2018",Yes,I would never have guessed the ending.  I have read hundreds of who done it books by many great authors.  It left me in wow mode.,0
2.0,Ugh - what a waste!,"November 14, 2018",Yes,"That is 8 hours of my potential sleep time I will never get back.  I have read all of John Grisham's novels and most I have loved or at least liked.  The visuals initiated by his writing in The Reckoning are effective, but the story just laid there and died.  The reveals at the end (no spoiler alert needed here) had me thinking ""meh!""  Please tell me this just one bad outing by a Hall of Fame starting pitcher!",0
5.0,Great novel of suspense,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I love John Grisham's work!!!  His writing is always superb. This novel is one of his best, the story seems so straight forward until the end when he throws the kicker in. Great job of writing and suspense.",0
1.0,Not worth the time,"November 21, 2018",Yes,Weak plot. Disappointing end and contrite..Grisham’s worst work to-date I’m sorry to say..Don’t bother reading as you’ll be sorry.,0
5.0,Horsham at his best,"December 5, 2018",Yes,"Horsham at his best. A mystery, an action thriller. The ending comes first. Then the story is told. You have to read to the end.",0
3.0,Expected More,"November 30, 2018",Yes,Creative and patient character development is woven into a story that jumps in time and at points could be an historical novel. All of this finds the reader clamoring for a particular answer for the many intrinsic questions asked..Then the bus crash... The disappointing and hasty finish.,0
5.0,One of the Best Books I've read in a While,"December 3, 2018",Yes,This is a great book by John Grisham. He is such a good author. This book held my interest and then some during the entire book!,0
5.0,Another Great Read,"November 26, 2018",Yes,"Love all of Grisham's books. This one came close to home. A dear friend of my family survived the Baatan Death March. He refused to talk about it other than he survived on bugs, grass and anything else he could find to eat. Graham described it so well that I pictured Chuck in the place of Pete.",1
1.0,This book was a waste of time reading.,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"I did not like the fact that the novel was slow developing, did not have any real mystery to it, was not a courtroom trial thriller, was not interesting, was pretty obvious in its conclusion and had 100 plus pages of WWII Battan history that while interesting was not meaningfully tied into the book.  Grisham is an outstanding writer.  This was an easy read.  It was just a waste of time.  Alan Briggs",0
5.0,Why did he do it?  Can you figure it out?,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"Once again, never decide for sure what the motive is before the.last chapters of a Grisham book.  Very good page turner.",0
4.0,Good Read Except.........,"December 7, 2018",Yes,Keep my interest throughout the book except for the final chapter.  Wanted more of a closure than what developed.  It seemed a little contrived.,0
5.0,L,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"Typical Grisham leaving you waiting, diving into more and more endless details as if they would be meaningful to the outcome, or not. Gets the end, driving readers crazy with anticipation before dropping it on you. You've got to be thinking you've figured that Dexter Bell had to have done it, right? It's all there until, presto, he's done it again!!!",0
1.0,Ug!,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"This book once again is a disappointment. I keep buying his books in hope they will read as when he first started out. Not this one too long, boring, wanted to read the last chapter early on but did not.",0
5.0,Totally captivating and enjoyable.,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"The length of the war period was too long. I wanted to get back to Clanton and get on with the Real Story! Also, if this ever becomes a movie, I think Blythe Danner would make a perfect Aunt Florry.",0
1.0,6 good chapters with nonsense in between,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"I read all Grisham books and this was by far the worst. A revenge killing, a painstakingly detailed and pointless trial . . . 200 pages about a war that means NOTHING to this crime . . . the reveal. Literally the last 2 pages of the book tells you what really happened. You will have guessed 94% of what happened the 6% difference is irrelevant.",0
5.0,This is a legal thriller that is a very dominating and suspenseful!!!!!!!!!!,"November 24, 2018",Yes,I like everydaything with the experience of suspense a legal thriller is known to possess with the flavor of John Grisham!!!!,0
5.0,Good,"November 19, 2018",Yes,Enjoyed the suspense but the ending was a little rushed and hanging. Would recommend to friends and look forward to his next book.,0
5.0,A very new John Grisham book,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"Outstanding!  After years of the same formula, this book is a very different John Grisham work.  Fantastic history lesson and great legal story.... I could not make a better recommendation.",0
5.0,Great read with unusual but great back and forth,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Enjoyable with little story's here and there to sew the plots. Yes..sew and show. Ending was a surprise. Keeps attention.,0
5.0,I love the look back at WWII.,"November 24, 2018",Yes,Great book!,1
1.0,Don't spend your money on this book.,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"Not what I expected from Grisham.  Boring for the most part.  I did read the whole book, but Grisham has ventured way beyond the great books that made him a popular writer.",0
4.0,Lots of lawsuits,"November 25, 2018",Yes,engaging tale with lots of info about WWII in the Pacific  - this is not the authors wheelhouse but he has done lots of research.,0
4.0,Not a typcial Grisham Novel..but still good.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"This author can write, set a scene and capture the emotions. Yet, it's not your typical legal mystery though it does have a surprised ending.",0
4.0,Not my favorite,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Not my favorite. Good story but just not my type.  Don't like going back and forth with the story  Pretty predictable.,0
5.0,The Reckoning,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"A, glad I preordered this book. It has been a no put down, but I wish Dexter was guilty so that Joel and Stella Banning would get their land back.. 👍🏾👍🏾John Grisham",0
3.0,Good but somewhat predictable,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"I loved the book but predicted the ending wayyyy before I got there.  I found it really long.  Very sad story, though.",0
1.0,Awful,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"But I DID finish it.  Much like a soap opera....I expected better from Grisham, and was disappointed.  Waste of money.",1
5.0,Another excellent book,"November 25, 2018",Yes,Liked everything about the book although it didn't end the way I wished. Grisham keeps you on your toes right to the end.,0
5.0,"One of his best books.  Grisham is clearly one the most talented writers of his generation. His diversity is phenomenal in spite of the recurring obsession with the legal system. When he digresses to pure story telling, he is as good as it gets .","November 24, 2018",Yes,"Grisham is unmatched for having a fertile brain. The pace And clarity of his writing is unique. There really is never a dull chapter in his books. He can write about any subject- war stories,relationships, nuances of personality all equally good. I especially appreciate his descriptions of rural life and southern culture.",1
3.0,A huge stretch even by his standards,"November 5, 2018",Yes,I could not bring myself to believe the tales relating to the Bataan experience beginning with the escape.  I like these elements to be believable even if they are not true.,0
5.0,Great read,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"A great read as usual. The whole history section of WW II was very informative and heavy - not an easy read,  but history we should know.",0
4.0,Packed with history and tales of the old south,"November 22, 2018",Yes,I didn’t give this book five stars because it isn’t one of his best. But it’s good! The end of the story is told in the beginning leaving you thirsting for the truth. The history of the war and experiences of a POW in the Philippines was so interesting but so horrible. I’m waiting for the next one John!!!!,0
5.0,Read if you enjoy surprise endings,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I've loved John Grisham's books.  This one had an ending no one would expect.  If you like really surprise endings, read this one!",1
5.0,What a great read,"November 15, 2018",Yes,One of his best. Don't miss a single line. It's very difficult to put the book down. Enjoy yourself with this story.,0
5.0,Another Great one!,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"Courtroom drama, a dysfunctional Family, a war hero and beautiful wife in small town Mississippi, a war adventure that is really eye opening!  Everything in this book makes it worth reading, even Grisham acknowledgments!.Don’t pass it up!",0
5.0,Different but very good,"November 17, 2018",Yes,Not the typical Grisham novel but it is a riveting story.  The ending will come as surprise that you didn’t see coming.,0
2.0,Tough Read,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"I read all JG’s books.  This one took forever, and figuring out the punchline was way too early in the book and anticlimactic.  Of all the fiction books I’ve read from JG this one is at the bottom.  I was very disappointed.  Compare this to his earlier works is just impossible like two different writers.  Sorry.,,I wanted to like it.",1
3.0,My least favorite from this author.,"November 17, 2018",Yes,And I've read and enjoyed all the others.  This one takes so long to get into I almost put it down several times.  The conclusion is less than satisfying.,0
5.0,What a read!,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"This is very well written, but at times hard to read. It’s detailed but very sad. A completely unanticipated ending!",3
4.0,A great improvement,"November 27, 2018",Yes,I have been very critical of the last couple of books from John Grisham but this latest book is a vast improvement. Not on a par with some of his older books but certainly worth reading...I hope this means we can look forward to future works of a similar or even higher storytelling,0
5.0,Different turn from the other books.,"October 31, 2018",Yes,"It was the best hes ever written, I have read all his books, this hands down is the best.",2

5.0,Stunning,"November 16, 2018",Yes,What a stunning and marvelous novel. It's full of mystery and interwoven secrets. What a storey. Grisham at his best.,0
5.0,Intriguing until the end,"November 3, 2018",Yes,The whole book is the entertainment of reading.  The characters pull you into their story...Then you believe what you are eventually going to find...Then you are wrong...Well done!,0
5.0,Rivetting...,"November 2, 2018",Yes,I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the mystery.  I liked the kids trying to understand the complexity of their parents.,0
2.0,"After a great start, I struggled to finish it","November 18, 2018",Yes,"The story starts well and the book, as you might expect, is very well written  But the second half of the book, the half that eventually solves the mystery, is tedious.",0
3.0,A good story,"November 24, 2018",Yes,The story of a strong man. The time and details of war years go on and on. I found it difficult to get to the end,0
5.0,Great,"November 10, 2018",Yes,"one of the best books I have read this year.  A little different for Grisham, but loved it all the way through",0

1.0,Worst. Book.  Ever!,"November 3, 2018",Yes,Please friends-do not buy this book.  It is poorly written and drags on for pages.  It is a shameless waste of time and money.  Grisham has sunk to a new low.,7
3.0,Love Grisham,"November 9, 2018",Yes,I love to read John Grisham’s book and know I always will. The Reckoning a disappointment but am sure better will return.,0
1.0,Disappointing at best,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"I did not even recognize as a Grisham novel.  Very slow, tedious.  I cannot recommend.",5
3.0,Not his best work,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"Interesting  story but not very suspenseful like most of grishams work.  Just so, so in  my opinion.  Wish I had waited and gotten it on sale!",0
1.0,what a waste of time,"November 11, 2018",Yes,The characters are poorly developed. The story preposterous. I mistakenly slogged through the whole book to see what happened and it wasn't even worth knowing. Average 9th grade writing.. Don't waste your time on this one.There is good fiction to read.,1
4.0,good book,"November 27, 2018",Yes,not the best novel Grisham has written. A little confusing in places and a disappointing ending.I felt left up in the air.,0
5.0,Another Grisham masterpiece,"November 27, 2018",Yes,"The story line is full of  the clydeoscope of  human failure. It's misplaced emotions, conditions,  and none more so than act of  truthfulness,  and forgiveness.",0
4.0,Murder Not Good,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"the war hero ruining his childrens' lives, and not telling why he did it.",1
5.0,Great Read!,"December 1, 2018",Yes,"This book, like most of Grisham’s books, is a great read.  You think you have the ending guessed but do not find out til the very end.",0
1.0,Grizzly Grisham,"November 9, 2018",Yes,Terrible story one big mistake by an author who thinks he can write any rubbish.and it will be accepted because he is beyond criticism,0
5.0,His best book!,"November 12, 2018",Yes,Could not put it down!  Twists and turns and I was in a panic to find out what happened.  This is a great read.,0
5.0,John Grisham is a born storyteller,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"His books are sometimes fun (Camino Island) and sometimes less so, but always captivating. “Reckoning” is a page-turner that keeps you reading until the last page. True Grisham.",0
5.0,WOW!,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"A really good read! Diverse and interesting on many levels.  Hard to put down.And what a shocking ending. Lies, lies,lies",0
5.0,Not your typical lawyer mystery or courtroom drama,"November 27, 2018",Yes,I always like anything that John Grisham writes. This one is a little different due to the beginning of the book. I recommend this book and all other of his books.,0
4.0,"Good story, unsatisfying ending","November 27, 2018",Yes,I really enjoyed the historical background to this book but found the ending disappointing although realistic.,0
4.0,Unusually different format,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"Typical of a John Grisham Book, hard to put down. Format made it difficult to.put down until all questions were answered",0
5.0,Riveting,"October 28, 2018",Yes,I picked up part of the motive when Pete shot  the preacher but still remained in suspense until the  very last chapter!  Very well done!  I finished it in one day.,1
4.0,Engaging but frustrating,"November 6, 2018",Yes,I couldn’t put this book down because i loved the characters so much. I  was frustrated throughout parts of the book because i would expect a Grisham novel to have lawyers actually do more investigating but i guess that’s part of the story to keep you guessing.,0
3.0,Not his best work,"November 17, 2018",Yes,Interesting tale of the south in the mid 40's but not the typical legal thriller you expect from this author .,0
4.0,a hard read,"December 6, 2018",Yes,A very difficult book to read for this lady . fighting in the war was amazing for what Pete had to endure. Did not care for the ending.,0
4.0,"Intriguing story. Yet, in the end......","November 5, 2018",Yes,"Very intriguing opening. Could’nt put it down..Yet, in the end, with clues provided earlier. But missed. The identity is revealed.",0
5.0,Another good one,"November 24, 2018",Yes,Very different  format from his others.  As always  you can't put it down.  A good read. I would recommend it.,0
4.0,Another Grisham classic!,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"As always, a genuine page-turner by Grisham. Being a stickler for historical accuracy however, I found a few things a bit unbelievable, but those notwithstanding, this is another excellent work from Grisham.",1
1.0,Waste of my time,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"At least 50 pages of descriptions of Japanese murders and tortures  during the war - had absolutely nothing to do with the plot.  Worse than that , you had to wait to the very end to get a trivial explanation of the murderer's reason for his crime.",0
5.0,Haunting and mesmerising,"December 2, 2018",Yes,I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the amazing works of John Grisham.,0
4.0,Not bad,"November 13, 2018",Yes,Somewhat disappointed with this one.  Started out and really grabbed you but then a long drawn out 2nd half.,0
3.0,Has Grisham lost his edge?,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"This Grisham novel disappointed me. It started slowly, picked up a little but bogged down again in the end.",0
5.0,Great story,"November 17, 2018",Yes,Never in the world will you guess the ending. Nor will I tell. Im off to another Grisham yarn. Easy read.,0
4.0,one of Grisham's best,"December 7, 2018",Yes,How do you explain a review about a book that grabs you&gt;? This was a terrific novel was spell binding and the ending will astonish you--I could not put it down! highly recommend it,0
5.0,Outstanding l had to make myself out the book down. I recommend this book to anyone that likes John Grisham.,"November 29, 2018",Yes,It is so worth the read.. I have always liked Grisham. I consider this one of his best. Enjoy the book,0

5.0,Read this! Don't ask questions just read this.,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"Like John Grisham always does, I was surprised totally at the out come of this story. It's a great read.",0
4.0,Not what you’d expect,"November 7, 2018",Yes,A sad somewhat historical account of one family during and just afterWorld War II. Not the norm from thus rather prolific author.,0
3.0,Good but not great!,"November 15, 2018",Yes,"Not one of Grisham’s better novels - well written but a little too slow.  Also, not a very satisfying ending and very disturbing.  Left me wanting a little more.  Simply sad and no real sense of justice with a lot of bad choices mixed in...I have to admit that I will still read whatever he writes next - I’ve basically read them all!",0
5.0,Wow!,"November 21, 2018",Yes,"Like all of his books, they keep me spellbound till the end.  This one did not disappoint!! . Now on to the next one.",0
5.0,A Different Grisham but truly enjoyed it.,"November 17, 2018",Yes,This is not your your typical legal thriller. There are plenty of lawyers and courtroom drama. What makes this a great read is entire backstory of Pete and the war. It's a long read but worth the time.,0
5.0,Enjoyed,"November 19, 2018",Yes,One of Grisham's most interesting novels..Learned much about the war in the Pacific front.,0
4.0,Not your usual Grisham.,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"Started out a bit slow, then picks up momentum. Truly, not his usual. But, a good story, in any case.",0
5.0,Another Great Story,"October 31, 2018",Yes,Another fantastic story by John Grisham!! I get completely involved in his books and read them in two or three sittings! Love them!,0
5.0,Not your usual legal entanglements,"November 17, 2018",Yes,A real twister for Gresham.  Seeing through the eyes of a young adults it’s not your usual legal entanglements .  Good WWII recreations.,0
5.0,Grisham at His Best,"November 19, 2018",Yes,"I have been a Grisham fan forever, enjoying the twists and turns of the legal world in each oh his novels. This book is equally gripping as the others and a wonderful twist ending. I highly recommend it.",0
5.0,Great Tragedy Saga,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"One of his best works in setting the time period of the story, the tone of Southern living, and the tragedy that unfolds.",0
5.0,Grisham Novels,"November 27, 2018",Yes,We have most of John Grisham's novels.  My wife says this one is the best yet. Finished it in two days.,0
5.0,Great Book,"November 13, 2018",Yes,"This book came to me with some of the pages still glued together, the page glued to the hard back has bubbles on the paper which means the glue wasn't enough for the paper to glue to the hard cover.  The jacket feels wet.",0
3.0,It's ok,"December 6, 2018",Yes,"Definitely not his best work. Grisham keeps you interested, even if the ending disappoints.",0
5.0,Great read!,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"Well written novel that kept my interest throughout!  I have read most of John Grisham's books, and this is one of the best!",0
5.0,Excellent reas,"November 16, 2018",Yes,I could not stop reading it.  The details were handed out in the smallest morsels.  I kept thinking of reasonable outcomes.  The warfare was very believable and I believe well researched.  Best book I've read in a long time.,0

4.0,Interesting Read,"November 26, 2018",Yes,This is different for Grisham but the story is very engaging. I read it in 2 days. Some of stuff on WORLD War OK are very interesting. I highly recommend this book.,0
5.0,"You won't be able to put th I s book down, excellent, all his books are good but the last few have been more then  5 stars .","November 4, 2018",Yes,"I would like to see it go on a little longer, but you can imagine what could, or did  happen .",0
5.0,the reckoning,"November 6, 2018",Yes,I enjoyed the novel by John Grisham. He is a great story teller and this one was exceptional.,0
4.0,Another solid work by Grisham...,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"This is definitely one of those “don’t want to put it down because you want to see what happens” books, enjoyable fiction with some strong historical references built in.  As a history buff, that was definitely an added bonus for me.",0
5.0,Loved it,"November 10, 2018",Yes,Hard story to put down. Been a John Gresham fan a long time. I think I've read every book he has written.,0
4.0,A rather dark tale with substantial history,"November 5, 2018",Yes,Great insight into southern culture and WW2. It was a rather depressing read and lacked the humor I enjoy. It is a challenging book.,0
5.0,A different but just as good as always read,"November 25, 2018",Yes,"A great read presented in three parts.  I especially liked  the 2nd part.  Well done, looking forward to the next novel.",0
5.0,Might be Grisham's best,"November 16, 2018",Yes,This one might be Grisham's best novel to date. The first two parts were amazing. The last part was a little slow but kept me engaged until the very last word. Highly recommended.,0
5.0,Historically accurate and so engaging...,"October 25, 2018",Yes,A wonderful departure from the typical (well crafted) thrillers we’ve come to expect from JG. Three distinct sections weave together to tell a historical story that is both personal and engaging. Highly recommended.,1
1.0,Skip it,"November 22, 2018",Yes,Preposterous and very annoying plot with a token and predictable payoff.  The historical aspect of the WW 2  conflict was the only compelling part of the book.  Mr Grisham - if you want to write a history book do it.  Don’t wrap it in a pathetic story that defies logic. (-as if no one would even ask the wife throughout the entire protracted process),0
4.0,Just okay novel.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"I’ve read every Grisham book this was not his best. In fact the last several efforts have been just average, not at the level of his early work. That being said I still read it to the end.",0
2.0,Disappointing,"November 18, 2018",Yes,"Fractured plot, I skipped much of the war experiences to get to ""why""  Pete killed Dexter.",0
5.0,An epic journey that twists and turns.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,This story is Grisham at his very best. Set in the 1940s it's a tale that can't be put down.,0
5.0,Great book.,"November 24, 2018",Yes,Another great Grisham book. Lots of good twists in a hard to put down story. Always well written with interesting characters.,0
5.0,Great read,"December 1, 2018",Yes,I love this author and have read everything he has written. I tend to just inhale the book until the last few chapters then I slow down to a crawl never wanting it to end.,0
5.0,Great story line.,"November 13, 2018",Yes,I thought it was the best book he had written in years. Had me fooled in the end.,0
3.0,Good read!!!,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I had a hard time reading this book, liked the story but did not the graph details of the war.",0
5.0,A Great Read,"November 28, 2018",Yes,This was one of Mr Grisham's finest novels.  Once you start reading you can't put it down.  The ending was not something you expected. I often wondered why Jupe was mentioned as he had no real reason to be in the book. Found out I was wrong. Have read all of Grisham's books. Outstanding writer.,0
5.0,I really like the story,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"Of course there is some court room drama, but Grisham did such a great job of developing his main character. I also enjoy historical fiction and got a taste of that in this book.",0
5.0,Great read,"October 28, 2018",Yes,Enjoyed the book immensely.Great story line hard to put down... I enjoyed the historical aspect and learning about the war,1
4.0,Reading and chapters sequences,"November 24, 2018",Yes,Excellent reading except I felt like the last chapters should have more closer toward the ending.,0
1.0,Save your money- this is craptacular.,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"Easily the worst book I’ve read in years. Grisham has had a few hits and more than a few misses. This is a giant whiff. I can’t get my money back, but you should absolutely save yours.",1
3.0,All that and this is the ending ?!?,"November 26, 2018",Yes,There is no surprise here and by the time I finally got to the end  I didn't care.  None of this justified the killing. And we had to hear on and on about courtroom stuff.  And the children. And the trips. The Bataan and WW2 was interesting. But this could have been a short story in The Atlantic.  Three stars because the man can write well.,1
5.0,The Reckoning: A Novel,"November 24, 2018",Yes,The Reckoning: A Novel by Grisham. Great as always! Did not see the ending coming!,0
5.0,Good Read,"November 12, 2018",Yes,This is one of Grisham's very good books.  After a hundred pages I could not put it down!,0
5.0,A very different read,"November 13, 2018",Yes,This book is so unique in its presentation. It is a mystery and a history lesson. Its unique format make it a very interesting story.,0

5.0,Great Grisham!,"October 29, 2018",Yes,Well developed characters.  An interesting mystery revealed unexpectedly.  Read almost straight through.,0
5.0,Gripping and Heartbreaking,"November 22, 2018",Yes,Another amazing tale from the master of courtroom drama. Touching and heartbreaking scenes of the war in the Phillipines and the bravery and endurance of our fine fighting men in WW 2.,0
5.0,loss of sleep,"October 30, 2018",Yes,When I begin reading one of his books I can assure myself that it will be all nighter.,0
2.0,His worst yet.,"November 3, 2018",Yes,"No imagination, story in reverse order, uninteresting. A cynical effort earn a buck. He should hang his head in shame.",1
4.0,His good stuff is back,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"If nothing else , a great summary of WW II Phillipines/ better than his recent work",0
5.0,Good story,"November 7, 2018",Yes,John Gresham never fails to tell a good story and this one was no exception.,0
3.0,Disappointing book from a favorite author,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"If you want to spend about a third of your reading time learning all about World War II, the death march, treatment of prisoners of war - you will enjoy this book. I did not.",0
5.0,Great read all the way through,"November 20, 2018",Yes,Grisham has done himself proud with this one.  Suspense til the very end!!,0
5.0,Another Southern tragedy,"November 17, 2018",Yes,"As always, Grisham does not disappoint-Interesting thru out and guessing until the end.  Truly enjoyable.",0
1.0,No Reckoning,"October 30, 2018",Yes,I usually like Grisham’s books. This one was a slog.  Could barely get through it.  Not a sympathetic character to be found. Gory in all the wrong places and a dud of an ending..Disappointed.,1
4.0,The Reckoning,"November 29, 2018",Yes,"It was a page turner; however, the ending was anti-climatic.  I would rate it at a three and a half.",0
5.0,Another #1!,"October 29, 2018",Yes,This book was hard to put down! Riveting from page one! Can't wait for the movie! It's bound to be a blockbuster!,7
5.0,Great read!,"November 13, 2018",Yes,Hated to see this book end. Love all the Grisham books and found this one to be one of his best.,0
5.0,Another winner,"October 27, 2018",Yes,"As usual, a good read. A warning for Vets, though: PTDS issues so take care. Not for everyone.",0
5.0,Another great book!,"November 26, 2018",Yes,I always like John Grishams' books. This one will not disappoint!!,0
5.0,Grisham’s Best,"November 15, 2018",Yes,Excellent. Not your usual “little lawyer takes of big bad corporate America”. Great WWII history with a real twist @ the end....,0
2.0,Makes you feel miserable every page.,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"I can't believe this novel came from the guy who wrote A Time to Kill, one of my top five stories of all time.  This book is terrible from beginning to end.  I have read every Grisham novel, and this one ranks dead last in my opinion.  I would suggest it's better to take a year off than to push out a book like this.",0
3.0,Premeditatd Murder is the Opener,"November 9, 2018",Yes,It is an interesting story which  drug on after part one!  The last part of the book was very  slow and uneventful.,0
3.0,To much gore,"November 24, 2018",Yes,"I think that the time spent on ""the Bataan Death March"" was a bit much. The suffering of those men can never be understood, they are all hero's, forever and always. I don't know how many pages would have been have appropriate to explain the survival of Major Banning, but it seemed excessive.",0
3.0,Not his best novel,"November 10, 2018",Yes,I have read better Grisham novels. Crazy ending based on the storyline.,0
5.0,"The Reckoning, A can't stop until it's finished read. I loved every character and every situation they were plunged into. The war story so tragic as unbelievable pain on a human being, inflicted by another human","November 10, 2018",Yes,"is hard to deal with..I was in the dark until the very end..Thank you John Grisham, for the thrilling roller coaster ride.",0
5.0,Great story,"November 9, 2018",Yes,Was intrigued by the book structure. Truly loved the second part about the Bataan death march,0
3.0,Senseless Disception.,"November 9, 2018",Yes,Not up to Grisham’s standard. A sad commentary on post WW-2 life in the south.,0

1.0,Boring,"November 19, 2018",Yes,Wasn’t interested in WW1 which 1/3 of the book was devoted to. The whole story could have been 1 page. Should have been left as a tale and not embellished as a book.,1
5.0,One of Grisham's finest!,"November 22, 2018",Yes,"One of Grisham's very best.Compelling. Finely constructed!, with beautiful characters, timing and tempo. A gripping and well-woven, seamless exposition of the Bataan experience.

I have read all his novels which I find captivating and intriguing. He grabs the reader's attention  at the very beginning and one is spellbound to the e nd,0
4.0,Too  much detail he military history,"November 2, 2018",Yes,"Too much detail on the miitary history.  This was a distraction  and made the story details somewhat weaker and disconncted. The ending, however,  wss a nice twist.",0
1.0,don't bother,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"well written but boring account of a very unlikely event, you can save yourself trouble by reading the first two and last two chapters if you happen to buy it or just scan it at a bookstore.  Grisham still writes well but he has long since run out of new material or ideas, worthless in my estimation.",1

5.0,"""The Reckoning"" revealed!","November 7, 2018",Yes,"Good read from John Grisham.  As a trial lawyer, i found the legal proceedings accurate, however I had not heard of a traveling electric chair.  The final twists and turns kept me moving quickly to the end.  The Bataan portion of the book was interesting and realistic.",0
5.0,Grisham doesn't disappoint.,"November 13, 2018",Yes,Good read by Grisham.  When you think you have it figured out - you don't.,0
3.0,Mississippi Injustice,"November 13, 2018",Yes,Book had a most unusual plot. There were several going back to previous scenes that caused some confusion.,0
2.0,Why do I read this stuff,"November 26, 2018",Yes,Overall the book was so-so.  It had some good history lessons but Grisham couldn’t avoid hitting on some liberal issues.  That to me is tiresome.  Fortunately I was able to get a free copy.  I would recommend reading if you can do likewise.  Another good point was it reads fairly fast.,0

4.0,Good book,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"It was a good book....I had to skip some of the war part, it became to much two take in.  It didn’t end the way I hoped it would,  but overall it was another good book by John Grisham",0
2.0,stick to crooked southern politicans,"November 3, 2018",Yes,The whole middle of the book about the Bataan death march is irrelevant to the story. If you have read anything on this subject save your money and wait for his next book.Too long with an ending not worthy of his work.,0

4.0,It's the old John Grisham,"November 18, 2018",Yes,The ending was anti-climatic but it was a good read. His past few novels were not the Grisham I liked but the good news is that he's back!,0
3.0,Too much war story,"November 5, 2018",Yes,The present-day parts of the book were good. But in the middle was much too much about the protagonist’s experience in the war. Just a bit of that would have sufficed to show us that he’d had a rough time.,0

5.0,Riveting Story,"November 11, 2018",Yes,"Great read, from beginnings to end.  I was stunned by the end.  I choose the book because John Grisham is one of my favorite authors.  His descriptions of the people he fought with and against in WWII were tragic and believable.  Family problems and country life in the South in that time were hard and his writing made the story plausible.",0
5.0,A Parable for Our Time,"October 28, 2018",Yes,"Grisham reminds us of two cultural truths: 1) a lie can be very destructive, and 2) when you go black, you can’t go back.",1

You have to feel incredibly sad for Pete who goes off to war and goes through hell only to return to the mess he finds back home...Overall a well written novel that I would recommend with 4 stars, but it is a bit wordy at times.  But still a decent - albeit depressing read.",15

2.0,terrible story so depressing,"October 24, 2018",No,I gave this two stars only because you can't fault Grisham for his writing he is easy to read even when the book is bad. Sometimes I feel guilty when I return a book for a refund but not in this case it was easy.  If I want a history lesson then I will buy a history book. Even though I do like history I do not need a 100 pages in a fictional book to tell me this kind of history. Then to top it off we end up making the ending a lesson of history of another kind that is even more depressing. I don't have to have ever book have a happy ending but at least leave some of the ending what the reader hopes will happen for the people left behind.,17

5.0,Riviting story,"October 27, 2018",No,"I'm not sure what to make of the mixed reviews about this novel. I guess we all have our own tastes and opinions. Personally, I have read all of Mr. Grisham's novels and many hundreds of others. This one, ""The Reckoning"" really touched my heart. The description of the Bataan death march was utterly jaw-dropping. I also disagree with those who have alleged little character development in The Reckoning. On the contrary, I was captivated by all of the characters and the complex relationship between most of them. This effort marks a significant departure for Mr. Grisham from his usual genre, and perhaps that is why some readers are unhappy. I, on the other hand, think it is his best work ever! Keep it up, sir.",8
2.0,"Grisham needs to stick to lawyer stories, not war stories","October 24, 2018",No,"Though Grisham is as good of a writer as ever, The Reckoning has a sub-par story line.  Yes, the book starts out quickly and Part 1 (20 chapters) is a compelling read.  But Part 2 (15 chapters) is boring and trite.  Grisham tries to be a grotesque war writer.  This is the first time I have skipped LARGE portions of Grisham's text.  He apparently does not like General MacArthur or the Japanese.  This is the worst story line I have read by one of America's greatest story tellers.  If you are a Grisham fan, read the book - but prepare to be disappointed.",8
1.0,Typical Grisham rehash,"October 23, 2018",Yes,"A typical John Grisham rehash.  WAY too wordy, depressing and NOT a good read",15
2.0,"Not Southern Gothic, just gruesome","October 23, 2018",No,"Author John Grisham never fails to tell a story well, but in this instance, I question whether the story needed to be told at all.  In a departure from his typical legal thriller, Grisham tells the story of Pete Banning, favorite son of Clanton Mississippi and a surviving WWII POW veteran.  After being declared dead, yet somehow miraculously surviving the horrors of the Bataan death march and POW Camp O'Donnell, Pete Banning returns home for a joyous reunion with his family. But shortly thereafter, something goes horribly wrong: his wife ends up in a mental institution and Pete is charged and convicted with the cold-blooded murder of his pastor, Reverend Dexter Bell. In the drawn-out legal battle that ensues, Pete's only statement to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family—was: ""I have nothing to say."" There is no happy ending here folks, my only satisfaction was to finish the book. I would not call it Southern Gothic, merely gruesome.  #TheReckoning #NetGalley",10
2.0,A Tedious Yarn with Un-stifled Yawns,"November 1, 2018",No,"SPOILER ALERT.John Grisham’s latest is a weak, tedious contribution to his catalog.  Peter Banning shoots the Reverend Dexter Bell and no one really knows why. Peter takes the reason with him to his grave, leaving his grown children and others to try and untangle the mess as unscrupulous others maneuver to steal the family farm..The story starts off well, another solid page-turning legal thriller. But it derails when giving a long narrative of Pete’s heroic World War II service. I was not emotionally involved with Pete as a character-he is dead by the time this narrative begins, and this extended digression does not move the story along nor does it build to anything. Later, the death of Pete’s wife is clearly foretold, leaving the reader little emotional buildup. The overall writing lacked punch and seemed to try to get to the next sentence, the next page. Even the different legal maneuvers, often a high point in a Grisham novel, to save the farm are thought to be futile by the characters themselves. The final pay-off-why did Pete kill his pastor- is given at the very end and left this reader with a “so what?” feeling.  The grown son’s final words, which end the book, are “What a family”.  My thought is, what does one expect in such a weak entry..I work part time at a bookstore and am amazed at the number of books that monthly, even weekly, come and go. Few writers have John Grisham’s sales and staying power. Yet The Reckoning is his third weak entry in a row, making me reconsider how much of a committed fan I’ll remain in the future.",5
1.0,Can I Get a Refund?,"October 31, 2018",No,"I've read everything Grisham has written, so when I saw this book, I ordered on pre-release...no questions asked. Big mistake. Chapter 1 starts with a bang, and then the story dwindles downhill from there. Pointless and boring. It seemed like a third of the book was dedicated to how Pete's sister changed life in the county jail by bringing an occasional  basket of fried chicken for the boys (inmates). Save your money. This is not the Grisham you may have grown accustomed to.",8
3.0,Not worth my time.,"October 31, 2018",No,"I've read many John Grisham books.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  I looked up on page 148 and said to myself ""we're finally going somewhere"".  I was pretty certain the book had to get better so I stuck with it.  Ok, so the middle was pretty interesting and keep me reading.  But again the ending became predictable and sluggish.  JG can be a suspenseful writer which is why I keep buying his books.  But he missed the opportunity to turn this book into a great book by not editing it down to a 300 page page-turner.  I gave the book 3 stars.  I would rather give it 2 1/2. But I decided 3 stars because the middle of the book was well done.",8
2.0,Disappointing and Disturbing,"November 1, 2018",No,"For years and years now, John Grisham has been one of my favorite authors. I think I’ve read almost all of his books, either purchasing them or borrowing from local library, and really look forward to reading each new release. But I could have totally done without this book. I didn’t care for the style, jumping around in time, and it was disturbing from start to finish. I know “A Time To Kill” was disturbing, but that novel was powerful and delivered a message we all needed to hear in the South. When I finished reading “A Time To Kill”. I immediately wanted everyone I know to read it also. It was breathtaking in its excellence. When I finished reading “The Reckoning”, I regreted reading it and would never recommend it to someone else. And that’s the first time I’ve felt that way about a John Grisham novel.  I really hate writing a negative review about a John Grisham novel, written by one of my favorite authors, but gotta keep it real.",6
1.0,Grisham’s Printing Money Again: Save Yours And Re-Read ‘The Last Juror’ Instead,"November 3, 2018",No,"If I were John Grisham, I’d probably be doing the same thing he is: Haphazardly throwing new names and “plot points” into old outlines, and printing enough money to fill a Brinks truck a week..But as a long time loyal reader of his, I wish he’d stop until he has an idea that truly lives up to his original gifts, and ‘The Reckoning’ isn’t it..I won’t spoil the ending (although saving you the $14.99/time you’ll invest in reading this mess would be worth it), but I’ll say this: By the time you get to the “big reveal” you won’t be able to care less about it..(Not only that, the “local color” sections are so dull and lifeless you’ll find yourself skimming them in an effort to just get it over with.).How else can I put this?.The parts meant to shock and sicken you won’t shock you at all (it is 2018 after all and we’ve all seen and read a million horrible tales) but they are graphic and heart wrenching enough to make you sick. Unfortunately there’s virtually no ‘relief’ to be found. While Grisham’s best work has brilliant bits of levity, this one has literally none..ie ‘The Last Juror’? This is NOT.",6
2.0,Disappointing,"October 26, 2018",No,"If you love John Grisham's courtroom suspense, this book will disappoint you.  The pace is glacial and the unimportant details are endless.  The ""mystery"" is set up in the first chapter and not answered until the end.  I kept hoping the answer would be a surprise in spite of the heavy foreshadowing.  It was not a surprise.  The overall theme is that a WWII war hero is a slave to his masculine code, even when it will ruin the lives of every important person in his life.  A modern mind already rejects the early 20th century masculine code as paternalistic, unreasonable and ultimately selfish.  This book will set that opinion in stone.",7
1.0,Weakest novel published by Grisham.  Skip it.,"November 12, 2018",No,"Long review.  The important part is - do not waste your time or money on this novel...Read most of Grisham's novels and enjoyed everyone.  Some more than others, but never felt like any were a waste of time...Until now.  I almost feel like I should reveal the big secret to save new readers the same pointless exercise I had to endure...Much of the novel was 'historical fiction'.  But Grisham could not take the time to fact check.  He had characters born in a US Army hospital in Germany in the 1920's.  The US Army was not in Germany until after WW2.  We certainly had no Army hospitals there.  Grisham also placed the 26th Cavalry Regiment in Kansas before WW2.  This unit was formed and served in the Philippines until it was deactivated post WW2.  These may be minor points, but it throws all of the history into question and some of it was important...The Bataan Death March is an important piece of history that does not need to be forgotten.  I do applaud Grishma's effort to bring this back to the attention of readers...The novel, more or less, revolves around the 'big secret'.  This is so very weak.  You will guess the secret way before it gets there.  You will doubt yourself, because it could not be that simple.  Yet it is.  Such a weak, predictable payoff.  There are also characters taking actions that do not fit and some dumb decisions by smart people.  Grisham is a better write than this.",3
2.0,No more Grisham books for me,"November 4, 2018",No,"Awhile back I was convinced that somebody was ghostwriting for Grisham as his books were getting worse and worse.  I decided to give him another try and his recent books were better.  But this is it for me with John Grisham.  He wasted over 100 pages writing about General MacArthur and Bataan -- when he could have described the impact of that on his story in a few paragraphs.  And then Grisham continues to string the reader along until he comes up with a ""surprise"" ending on page 413 of a 417 page book.  I did not bother to read much of the section about the war and I still wonder why I stuck with the rest of this book.  Pretty much a waste of time.  Now I need to find another author whose books I can enjoy -- like I once enjoyed reading Grisham.",3
2.0,...needs editing and a rewrite....,"October 27, 2018",No,"Some general observations.  An interesting start - essentially the first one third of the book.  Showed promise, but quickly got lost in a lengthy middle third dealing in gruesome detail about the fighting in the Philippines.  This is a great argument for ""editing.""  I saw absolutely no reason for this section;  it added nothing to this book.  A few paragraphs referencing Pete's experiences would have been more than sufficient to make the point.  The final third of the book presents a rambling, almost nonsensical story with some incredibly shallow characters.  It isn't until the final chapter that some depth is given to this narrative.  Come to think of it, the book would have, could have, been so much more interesting if Grisham had actually explored the complex relationship of the characters involved in ""Pete's motive.""  What a story that would have made!!!  Instead it gets just a cursory mention in the last few pages.....The writing is simplistic and juvenile.  On the level of a high school writing assignment.  This was very disappointing  This becomes so glaring after one has read some amazing authors like Daniel Mason and Simon Mawer..All in all a rather disappointing read;  not sure I would recommend this to anyone, nor am I plan on reading any more Grisham books - a shame....",2
2.0,Waiting in vain...,"November 5, 2018",No,"Unwrapping a new John Grisham book. It is a bit like Christmas Eve, really.  A beautiful hardcover book with an elegant cover by one of my favourite writers, ever...The first part is very good.  Not the best legal thriller Grisham has written, but his usual sarcastic view of the legal system, the death penalty and drama loving funeral directors.  Grim as the details were,  he made me laugh and well entertained. Hence the second star...After Part One I wondered what would come.  What came was a huge disappointment.  Through endless detailed war descriptions which in the end made me skip most of it, I still hoped for some fantastic unexpected solving of the BIG mystery - WHY PETE DIT IT?  And that was the final disappointment.  Talk about come down.  Talk about waiting in vain...I think Grisham is playing with writing different kinds of books.  He can afford it, having written so many exceptional legal thrillers in the past. The chapter about war is not bad, rather the contrary. However, if I want a book on war history I will buy just that and know what I'm getting...I hope Grisham will stop experimenting. Please give us more of your usual stuff, John. Like ""The Testament"", ""The Firm"", ""A Time to Kill"". This year's Christmas Eve is too early, but maybe next year?",2
1.0,good start descends to boredom,"November 4, 2018",No,"I have been less than enthusiastic about John Grisham novels since The Rogue Lawyer--a book I couldn't even finish.  While reading the first third of this novel I was very excited....it was really interesting and intriguing and I couldn't wait to find out what was behind the actions of the the main character.  When it diverged in the middle to the Bataan march, I was somewhat confused but it was still interesting.  Then came the most awaited third part.  What a bore.  The characters were entitled and whiny.  Page after page until finally the big ""secret"" was revealed.  To which my reaction was ""that's it???"".  waste of my time.",4
1.0,"The worst book Grisham has written, book of straw and dust.","November 2, 2018",No,"I cannot understand the reviews which state that this is a “masterpiece,” or that this is a great, interesting book. I guess that’s why there is such a divide in this country presently...half the country thinks one way, and the other half the opposite—and both sides think the other is crazy.  I loved Grisham’s first legal thrillers; however, the last few books have each been steadily worse than the preceeding one.  I think Grisham has run out of the magic touch.  He really seems bored himself.  As in an old southern saying, which Grisham no doubt has heard, I think “he has shot his wad!”  This is one of the most empty, dull, depressing books I have ever read.  I really didn’t care what happened to the characters in this book, except the minister, which we hardly got to know.  Some of the most unlikable characters ever in one book.  I returned this book, because there’s no chance I will ever reread it; plus, I felt cheated.  In fact,  I skipped the whole third about the Bataan March, which had very little to do with the storyline.  If I want to read a war story, I’ll buy a book whose cover indicates that’s what it is about. If this middle third of the book was to allude to why Pete was so austere, Grisham could have saved the reader a lot of misery by explaining why Pete was so stoic in a paragraph or two.  He didn’t have to make a whole second novel within a novel of it.  I’ve read all of Grisham’s books except The Painted House.  I probably won’t buy any more of his works, unless he goes back to his forte of real legal thrillers, like The Firm or A Time to Kill.  Grisham is apparently writing now based on his name and a paycheck.  That’s not right for his loyal readers, or even new readers.",3

No plot, no suspense, no tension and no drama... most of the book is about the Bataan Death March and Pete Bannings heroism after he escapes from the Japanese. It completely lost its way and made little sense.. even in the end it was not all that plausible and even though I finished it, it was very disappointing...Not sure if the author is under contract to submit so many books a year, but it certainly seems that way.. quantity over quality...",3
1.0,John Grisham should have known better! He's supposed to be a seasoned author. Such a disappointment.,"November 14, 2018",No,"A man commits murder in broad daylight. Despite repeated requests from his family and law enforcement officers, he refuses to say why and the fallout from the murder changes the family forever. John Grisham comes back with his latest novel, a plodding, meandering story in the lackluster book The Reckoning...After surviving horrific conditions as a soldier and a POW in the South Pacific in World War II, Pete Banning comes back to a hero’s welcome in Clanton, Mississippi. Even his severe injuries—in a cast from his hip down to his feet—can’t stem his enthusiasm for being home. During his months in captivity, thoughts of his wife, Liza, and his children, Joel and Stella, gave him the will to survive. Pete has seen and endured the worst that human beings can do to one another...Clanton residents receive a rude shock, then, when they learn that Pete has shot and killed the pastor of the Methodist church. Pete doesn’t deny it, and he doesn’t try to run when witnesses find him at the scene. He cooperates with the police, giving them the murder weapon and following them without a single word to the local jail...His reticence, however, is exactly the problem. Every time anyone—his lawyer; the sheriff; his sister, Florry—asks him why he did it, all he says is, “I have nothing to say.” The small-town gossip mill churns at a furious rate, but Pete refuses to confirm any of it. While he does feel a pinch of remorse for the pastor’s wife and three young children, he believes he made the right decision...Despite his lawyer’s best efforts, Pete receives the death penalty. Everyone in town agrees the killing was senseless, and they struggle to reconcile the image of war hero with that of common murderer. Surely Pete of all people would understand the sanctity of life, wouldn’t he?..Author John Grisham lets his story flounder from the beginning. In the first 90 pages of the book, the characters spend their time talking about how awful the murder is and the fact that they don’t understand it. By page 175 Grisham takes that part of the story to its conclusion with the exception of one major fact: the motive. Pete Banning remains steadfast in his silence throughout all those pages, but the gossip mongers—and common sense—will lead readers to draw a realistic conclusion on why Pete killed the pastor...Divided into three parts, the second section goes back to Pete’s time as a soldier and a prisoner of war. Grisham’s research is thorough and meticulous, but his prose keeps readers at arm’s length by simply narrating the story. Even the horrors of prisoner camps receive monotonous treatment. The juxtaposition turns the second part of the book, all 123 pages of it, into a dry history tale. Readers will feel some sympathy for Pete, but they wouldn’t be faulted for wondering about halfway through the narrative just what his experiences there have to do with the murder he commits later...Grisham attempts to answer that question in the last 112 pages (the final section of the book) and fails in a catastrophic manner, only because readers will already have guessed why Pete did it. A clumsy plot twist four pages from the end will likely disappoint and even anger longtime Grisham fans. The author, at one time known for smart, sharp plots, makes a lazy attempt at an ending that doesn’t fit with the storyline presented and seems more designed for sensationalism than anything else...The dialogue throughout is stilted and unrealistic. Pete Banning’s family members spend all their time in the book wringing their hands and weeping at this horrible turn of events at their lives. No other characters received the development they so rightly deserved, leaving the Banning family to make the biggest impact. That impact is minimal, because they have nothing to do in the story...Even the most ardent Grisham fans will find it difficult to justify their loyalty after reading The Reckoning, which is why I recommend readers Bypass it.",2
1.0,Worst Grisham Book Ever !!!,"November 12, 2018",No,"This book is nothing but a teaser - Man walks in and shoots another man and then 420 pages later, the motive is given.  In the meantime, there is nothing but unnecessary details, tangential sidebars, and irrelevant back stories used as filler for 400 pages.  Grisham is getting worse -- his books never had any literary value, but now the plots are weak, as well.  He is just churning them out for suckers like me who regret the money they paid for this drivel.",4
1.0,hard pass.,"November 8, 2018",No,"Ugh, sorry book friends, but this one was so damn frustrating. No one is a bigger Grisham fan than I am, but I STRUGGLED through this book. Set soon after World War 2, the story follows Pete Banning, a decorated war hero on trial for the mysteriously cold-blooded murder of his pastor and friend, Reverend Dexter Bell. Refusing to explain his motives or help his attorneys plan a proper defense, Banning faces a difficult trial and a potential death sentence. Split into three sections, the first section of the book is classic Grisham: interesting crime is established, legal shenanigans ensue. But as soon as the plot starts to ramp up, everything comes to a screeching halt and the second section delves into Pete’s time in the armed services, which I couldn’t have been less interested in. The final section is devoid of twists or interesting plot developments and the ending feels abrupt and lacking (I seriously thought my copy was missing a couple chapters). Additionally, the entire book you can tell Grisham is purposefully withholding a key piece of information that will explain Banning’s motives...it’s sloppy writing and it’s infuriating, especially because when the info is finally revealed in the last 3 pages, it’s so lackluster and it actually comes across as icky and misogynistic. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I would recommend literally EVERY other John Grisham book before this one.",1
1.0,"Not Even Close to ""Real"" Grisham Books","November 9, 2018",No,"Don't waste your time on this complete downer.  The flimsy plot is based on a supposedly real happening that of itself was the sordid stuff you don't want to read in the news.  There are no winners in this story, just loss and defeat piled on more of the same to the last line.  To make it worse, a long Part Two takes you completely away from the main story to the ""uplifting"" brutal details of the Bataan Death March in World War II, which is a major distraction.  As a war documentary, it is the best told part of the book, but do you want to read a legal thriller or a war story?  I love the other Grisham books, but I will be wary of the next one after this disappointment.  It doesn't even deserve the 1 star I gave it.",2
2.0,Worst Grisham Read to Date,"November 12, 2018",No,"The ghost writer of this Grisham novel captured the essence of Grisham with the obligatory use of ""antique"" to describe someone old and same old Mississippi racism and backwardness.  But this novel was mostly predictable and very boring in the middle when the war part goes on and on.  Stella was a bore, a weak emotional mess and none of the other characters were very different or memorable.  My least fav Grisham book.  I have loved them all except for the abrupt ending of the Testament.  Skip this one if you have better things to do - just read a summary of the story.  One small paragraph should be sufficient.  I do appreciate that Grisham releases a book every 6 months and realize it is difficult to come up with new plots, characters, etc.  This one shows he has basically run out of ideas.  I suggest writing a novel inspired by today's divisive politics and the politically hacked US Supreme Court and the national embarrassment that is the current ""presi_DUH-nt.""  Throw in some legal thriller parts that is Grisham's expertise.  That would be a good read as long as it is not fiction - the reality of today's US government is down right frightening.",1
5.0,Grisham does it again!!,"October 29, 2018",No,"This novel captured my attention from the start.  It's a story both haunting and gut wrenching, leaving me wanting more.  As with all of John Grisham's books, the characters come to life, feel like your friends, and stay with you for a long time.  I only know about The Bataan death march from briefly reading about it in my youth..Its  an ugly truth that should be told, lest we forget the barbaric spoils of war.  While The Reckoning is most definitely different from his previous novels, it's most definitely worth the read.  I love the way Grisham weaves his magic words!!  Five star bravo!!",2
1.0,"Longtime Grisham fan, but...","November 12, 2018",No,"I couldn’t wait for this book to end. Much of the book was long, dry descriptions of war experiences that had nothing to do with the storyline (such as it was). The actual story was very underdeveloped, you could literally read the beginning and the end of this book and not have missed anything important. The characters were flat and dry and I didn’t really care about any of them, and the end, when we fiiinally got to the punchline, was very depressing. I have greatly enjoyed many of Grisham’s books, but I don’t recommend this one at all, it is nothing like his others.",3
4.0,Dark foreboding  elements,"October 27, 2018",No,"The sudden appearance of William Faulkner within these pages simply confirms that what you are reading is Southern Gothic or perhaps Greek tragedy...A proud white Mississippi family is rocked b an act of premeditated murder. The actor however is the family patriarch, a war hero who returns to his farm, wife and children after being reported dead along the Bataan Death March. Instead, after escaping he joins Philippine and American guerrillas fighting the Japanese. So he is a war hero, whose return from the presumed dead thrills his family and hIs hometown...Yet when this prosperous farmer kills the Methodist minister in cold blood, the tragedy begins to unfold...John Grisham is not Willam Faulkner but he displays an ability to wrap a narrative with dark foreboding elements. This is no little feat. And The Reckoning discloses a side of Grisham only hinted before.",1
4.0,Interesting story and a painful WWII tie-in,"November 12, 2018",No,"One of the great things about a John Grisham novel is his capacity to draw in his readers, and once again he has done it with The Reckoning. Despite the author’s return to Clanton, Mississippi, this isn't 'light-reading.' No spoilers here, but the main character, Pete Banning, murders the town's preacher in cold blood, and informs the witness, “call the sheriff.”.If you enjoy reading about WWII, a great deal of the book, is a series of flash backs from Pete’s being part of the Bataan Death March in the Philippines. Despite my love of history, at times it was difficult to read, and knowing it is based on actual facts, left me reeling..However, it is a good book, but not my favorite Grisham novel. There is so much involved with Pete Banning, his wife, and his two children. The final chapter, reveals Pete’s motive for the murder, and the back stories.  This one may not be for every John Grisham fan.",1
1.0,A real disappointment,"November 4, 2018",No,"Having loved all of John Grisham's previous books I pre-ordered this and eagerly awaited the release - but what a disappointment.  My kindle tells me that I have now read 56% of the book and I have finally given up as it is simply a long winded narrative which has failed to keep my attention. I am usually kept up at night finishing books from this writer, but not this time. Almost as if it was not written by Grisham at all, I just hope that his next novel goes back to the previous style.",4
3.0,"Not All Grisham's Novels are Going to be Winners, Just the Law of Averages  *Some Spoilers*","November 23, 2018",No,"This novel only received three stars from me because the middle section, which described Pete Banning's captivity and time as a guerrilla during World War II, was captivating.  If you're not interested in gruesome war scenes, however, give this one a pass.  The book begins with war hero Pete Banning murdering a popular local pastor.  Both families are completely destroyed by this one act.  Banning refuses to state his motive although there are clues, such as his wife being in an insane asylum for a mysterious reason.  He won't even tell when the governor offers to commute his sentence in return.  He goes to the electric chair leaving his once proud, close knit family in tatters...  After a long, frustratingly slow slog (the only interesting portion being the part about Banning's time as a POW) we finally find out the motive in like, the last three pages.  And it's a piss poor, ridiculous motive for killing someone, getting the death penalty, and destroying so many lives.  And the secret wasn't that big, I sort of figured it out but I thought it couldn't be that simple and stupid so I kept reading...  I had a problem with the blatant sexism and racism.  Yes, I understand that it's set in the forties and there is a context.  That in and of itself has NOTHING to do with how the characters are drawn, however.  The women are weak, whiny, and stupid.  The men are seen as strong and noble and intelligent.  The black characters are one dimensional portrayals.  I rolled my eyes over and over again when the hero (in one instance Pete Banning, the other Joel Banning his son) knew they found the love of his life.  Because it was the most beautiful woman they've ever seen, and based on that alone, they pursued these women with a stalkerish intensity that would have you jailed in the twenty-first century.  Honestly, these men would have fallen in love with Satan if he had a pretty face.  And at least in the elder Banning's case, the wife had absolutely nothing to offer besides her pretty face and her love of physical pleasure; otherwise she's weak and soft, unable to function without a man around...  The one female character who didn't fit the mold was Florrie, Pete's sister, and she's viewed as eccentric, crazy and enormous in size as well as dependent on Pete...  The end of the book leaves you feeling empty and frustrated.  So many hours wasted on a story that does not deliver and reinforces stereotypes.",0
5.0,Haunting Story,"November 18, 2018",No,"Without doubt, this is one of the saddest and most haunting books I've read in a while (close to downright depressing, in fact). What's more, about a third of it was so unsettling that insofar as possible, I skimmed through it. It is written matter-of-factly, without emotion - but the emotion comes through loud and clear nonetheless. Did I love it? In many ways, no; but in the overall scheme of things, it's pretty darned awesome...Let me clarify. The depressing part came near the end, when facts not previously in evidence were revealed (let's just say that O Henry's ""The Gift of the Magi"" came to mind). The unsettling part came in the middle, when details of the World War II military life of Pete Banning, one of the main characters, was outlined in all-too-vivid detail. If there's anything in this world I'd rather not read about, see, or listen to, it's the horrors of war. And the entire middle section of this book, Titled ""The Boneyard,"" lays it all out. Yes, it's a very important part of the story - but had I known it was coming I'd have left sneaker tracks on the sidewalk running the other way...That said, what a story it is. Set in small-town Clanton, Mississippi, after World War II has ended and Pete, thought to have been killed, returns home to his extensive cotton farm as a decorated hero. His wife, Liza, is in a mental institution - at Pete's orders - and their son and daughter are grown. In 1946, at the age of 43, Pete is about to do something virtually unthinkable, especially for a man of his stature; commit a cold-blooded murder. He freely admits to his guilt; what he refuses to admit, though, is his motive. He will, he insists, go to his death - a very real possibility if he's convicted by a jury - with his secret intact. His long-time family lawyer, nor his sister Flora, who lives on the farm, nor his children will ever hear the reason behind his action - at least never from his lips...From that point on, much of the narrative focuses on Pete's family background and what and how his children are doing, all of which takes place in a deep-South setting in which ""coloreds"" handle menial tasks and are not allowed to sit on the front porch of any home nor anywhere in a courtroom except the balcony. And of course, let's not forget the section that details what happened to him in the war when he was part of the historic Bataan Death March in the Philippines. Even though I didn't want to read it, I can't imagine the research it took to pull all that together. In the final section, ""The Betrayal,"" readers, along with Pete's two children - find out what really happened.",0
4.0,The Collateral Damage,"November 15, 2018",No,"John Grisham is one of the best storytellers of our time and this is a well-written book; so, why didn’t I enjoy reading this book you may ask? I consider this book three stories in one, each one more depressing and morbid than the other. I always enjoy John Grisham’s writing style that flows well, his grammatically impeccable sentences, and the fact the books always have something I learn from, but this 400+ page book doesn’t have any moment of happiness in it. It is about unfairness of life, violence and pain human beings capable on inflicting on others, predator nature of some people who don’t hesitate to take advantage of the helpless and hopeless people who need kindness the most, and how fragile and unfair life can be. I didn’t enjoy this book and hoped it would get better after the first part. However, after reading 200 pages, I felt compelled to finish it since I invested so much time...The first part of the book is about a war hero, landowner, and prominent member of the community killing his best friend, the pastor of the church that was built by the landowner’s grandfather years earlier. This section is about the devastation of the members of both families left behind, the court case, and the execution of the killer who refuses to tell why he killed the pastor. There is also a lot of information about the history of capital punishment by hanging and electrocution in Mississippi. The section about what happens to the body when hanged or electrocuted is not for the faint-hearted...The second part has the flashbacks of what happened to the war hero during WWII after General MacArthur moved to Australia and abandoned 80,000 American soldiers in Philippines to starve and to be tortured to death by Japanese soldiers, the Bataan Death March. It has blow by blow descriptions of the atrocities committed during the war and the incompetency of General MacArthur, who refused to listen the warning of his staff, ending up losing almost all the US war planes...The third part tells the story of how the children and the wife of the killer are victimized while still trying to cope with the devastation caused by the events. I give it 3.5 stars, 5 for storytelling and 2 for likeability .",0
5.0,THE RECKONING is yet another substantial addition to the Grisham library,"October 30, 2018",No,"A popular question asked of readers these days goes something like this: If you are having a dinner party for any writer living or dead, who do you invite? The answers are always interesting, and the list of invitees is lengthy and varied. Should I ever be asked that question, John Grisham would be on my short list...I think Grisham would agree that he isn’t Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Twain or even Faulkner. But he has written and sold many books, and each novel offers something new and different, following no specific formula or pattern. He often touches on contemporary legal events that include issues such as the death penalty, racism in the law, money, justice and, most recently, for-profit law schools. Over the years, I have written countless reviews for Bookreporter,and I await each of his works with the anticipation of baseball’s Opening Day or the first Friday night of high school football. THE RECKONING is everything that Grisham fans have come to expect --- and it might even be a little bit more...Grisham has chosen Ford County, Mississippi, as the venue for his latest offering. While clearly not as exotic as some of his other locations, it was the setting for A TIME TO KILL (his first novel), SYCAMORE ROW, and FORD COUNTY, a collection of short stories. Just as in his debut, Grisham begins THE RECKONING with a shooting. In the days after World War II, Pete Banning, Clanton, Mississippi’s hometown hero, walks into his Methodist church and shoots and kills Reverend Dexter Bell. No one knows why, and Pete refuses to give any reason. “I have nothing to say” is his only response to the police, his attorney and the court during his trial...Traditional Grisham fans will feel more comfortable in the first third of the novel, which recounts the details of the crime, the time spent awaiting trial, and the actual trial and sentencing. There is little doubt as to Pete’s guilt, and his attorney, John Wilbanks --- a name recognizable to readers of A TIME TO KILL --- finds himself stymied by his client’s intransigence. When questioned in court about ignoring Wilbanks’ legal advice, Pete’s reply is terse and clear: “I’m not ignoring my lawyer. I’m just not agreeing with him.”..Grisham paints a vivid portrait of rural Mississippi in the post-World War II era before the civil rights revolution would change the lives of both black and white Mississippians. It is a sobering portrayal. No one could fathom why the town hero would walk into church and kill their beloved minister. And when the criminal proceedings have come to their conclusion, there are only questions without any apparent answers...Opening a new vein in his writing, the middle third of the story is essentially a novel of World War II. Pete was a decorated veteran of the war, once actually presumed to have been killed during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. But those reports turned out to be false. He was captured, escaped and found himself attached to units of American and Filipino fighters engaged in guerilla warfare against the Japanese. Grisham’s account of Pete’s service is compelling and detailed, and readers will be totally riveted. Pete’s family continued their lives in Mississippi hoping he was alive but accepting the strong possibility that he was dead. In these sections, Grisham also drops a few additional clues suggesting why Pete would turn to murder upon his return home...The last third of the book brings a conclusion to the mystery that began with three gunshots in the office of Reverend Bell. Pete’s wife, sister, son and daughter seek the answers to the causes of the event that forever changes their lives. As they discover the final secrets and the explanation for their father’s behavior, they learn a far more important lesson --- that none of it really matters...Grisham’s novels, regardless of subject, have a consistent ability to raise meaningful issues for his readers. THE RECKONING is no exception and is yet another other substantial addition to the Grisham library...Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman",0
5.0,It’s Not Your Father’s Grisham,"December 5, 2018",No,"This is a VERY different book by John Grisham..The stories in Part 1 and Part 2, about the 1940s from injustice in rural Mississippi to war in the Philippines, are absolutely BRUTAL. Those who might wish to avoid vivid and detailed descriptions of things such as electrocution and the savagery of Japanese soldiers should definitely avoid these two Parts of the novel. However, those with “thicker skins”, such as myself, will find them truly fascinating. It would be a considerable understatement to call these stories merely gripping or intriguing. They are breathtaking...Part 1 is the tale of Pete Banning, a respected cotton farmer, who returns to his farm in Mississippi as a war hero after he had been thought killed in the Philippine war with the Japanese. His wife Lisa and college-age daughter Stella and son Joel are ecstatic. But, entirely unexpectedly, Pete kills a preacher who is a beloved man in the community; and Pete won’t say a word to anyone about why he did it, thus hastening his verdict...Part 2 skips back in time, beginning with Pete and Lisa’s happy lives together. And then Pete’s is called up to fight horrendously gruesome battles in the Philippines and is forced to join the Bataan Death March...Part 3 is more subdued and relates the circumstances after Pete’s return and trial and the civil suits brought against his children by the preacher’s wife that would deprive them from inheriting Pete’s farm. The reason Pete killed the preacher is finally revealed and is a BIG surprise...Throughout, the book is exceptionally rich in plot and character development, even for Grisham. And, of course, there is plenty of Grisham’s classic courtroom drama.",0
2.0,"If you like John Grisham’s good books, skip this one. It doesn’t measure up to the others.","November 9, 2018",No,"On page 12, Pete Banning, a war hero, who’d been presumed dead but had come home after being severely tortured and imprisoned for three years, walks into his pastor’s office and shoots him dead. We suspect we know why, but we don’t really learn the truth until page 413 when we’re told about his wife’s lie...I love John Grisham’s writing and I’ve read all his books except the Theodore Boone series. I did not like his last book (see #26 under 2017—funny they were both the 26th books I read in those years), and I like this book only slightly more. As Grisham tells us Banning’s whole life story, including his horrifying experiences in the Philippines during World War II, we’re troubled that a man with such a high level of integrity could do such a thing. We’re concerned about his wife, who had a breakdown not long after he returned and is committed to an institution. Slogging through four hundred pages without an answer to our nagging questions is decidedly unpleasant...When I finished the book, I asked myself if Grisham could have told the story differently. I don’t think so...Nevertheless, it was unsatisfying. I have three stacks of books on the floor of my study that I’ve been dying to read. I wish I’d read them first...If you like John Grisham’s good books, skip this one. It doesn’t measure up to the others..This is a best seller on Amazon. It doesn't deserve to be. Grisham is coasting. Don't buy this book. I'm not going to preorder any more of his books; I'm going to wait and see what real world readers say before I invest in his new releases again.",0
3.0,"Not his best work, and what is it with women characters?","November 6, 2018",No,"I follow Grisham and have read his entire body of work.  I was continually disappointed in his earlier books because of the 2-D treatment of women and girls in his stories.  But I had hopes that things would change in a couple of his recent novels, with female protagonists and even a set of female villains!  Unfortunately, this book is back to the misogyny, complete with yet another Grisham character whose abortion leads to terrible karma..._The Reckoning_ is a sort of mystery told backwards, a popular conceit these days (see PIcoult's latest, for example).  Interestingly, it's actually a very old style, used heavily by Faulkner, who randomly gets a cameo in this very book...The first part of the story is the crime and punishment, with little explanation.  It reads like typical Grisham, complicated men doing complicated things in a strong silent way.  The best part of the book is the middle, where Grisham goes into depth about the US-Japanese war in the Philippines.  You get the sense that this is really what he wanted to write a book about.  And I think he should have.  A war novel would be a natural for Grisham and his gender issues - almost all complicated silent men, with women sending the occasional cake or letter.  :)..The last part of the book explains the crime at the beginning of the story.  I saw the ending coming a mile away, but it was still a reasonable story to tell the way he did it.  To harp on my main objection, it was just so aggravating to have every man in the book have depth and interest, but every woman be either the young/beautiful girl, the good or bad wife, or the old/fat/wise sage...I read the author's note at the end, so I understand that he wanted to tell both a story enlightening why a man would go to his death rather than explain his crime, and also a story about the Philippines.  They just didn't need to be the same book.",0
4.0,An unexplained murder of a friend and minister and WWII in the Philippines.,"December 6, 2018",No,"Pete Banning was famous in Clanton, Mississippi.  He was a World War II war hero who had endured torture as a combatant and prisoner of war in the Philippines.  He participate in the Baatan March. He was a member of a prominent family, a good husband, father, neighbor, farmer, and member of the Methodist church. A few months after his hero’s welcome, his wife, whom he deeply loved, was institutionalized...A year after his return, Banning walked into the office of his minister and friend, Dexter Bell, and shot him to death.  He was quickly apprehended and refused to let his lawyer offer any explanation or defense, even though his punishment would be death.  Most of the book revolves around the murder...The middle third of the book deals with his experiences in World War II.  It presents a lot of detail about the battles, life as a P.O.W., and repatriation.  “They were dying of starvation even though food and water were plentiful in the Philippines....Everyman suffered from something, be it malaria, dengue fever, scurvy, beriberi, jaundice, , or diphtheria, pneumonia, or dysentery;, or a combination of these.”..Eventually, we do learn why Banning murdered Bell and refused to say anything about it  though there are several clues before that as to the probable reason.  It is not what it seems to be...An interesting read though it was drawn out.  .  I noticed one error that should have been caught by the editor: On p.119, it states that Dexter was lying on the floor.  On p. 120, it says he was in his chair.",0
5.0,"An engaging, enjoyable novel","December 3, 2018",No,"I admit I'm late to the Grisham fan club, though I've been aware of his background and literary success for many years. You can't be an American unaware of the block-buster movies made of his books, which have all but become a part of our culture. I've enjoyed the intelligent, suspenseful movies made from his books, yet, as far as novels go, suspense, thrillers, and such are not my preferred genre. Being, as it is, that I was raised in the same part of the country as Grisham, I was starting to feel disloyal to my tribe, so I bought this book on Kindle. AND TORE THROUGH IT!  I absolutely enjoyed everything about it, and feel that those reviewers who turn up their nose while taking a swipe at Grisham's literary prowess are sadly missing his stylistic appeal. Based on the merits of this book, I find Grisham a masterful story-teller, who rolled out this story without the convenience of bells and whistles to gift the reader with ""nothing but the facts."" After casting a line in deep waters from the onset,  page after well-wrought page kept me riveted because I simply had to know the why of the story. The crafting of this character-intensive novel worked splendidly.  Its strategic bread-crumbs filled me with anticipation as I waited with bated breath for the full confession to culminate in a cohesive story. Grisham is artful in his ability to string the reader along, and I loved every minute of it. From Character to setting to pacing, The Reckoning has all.  It is more than the sum of its parts, but what's so good about it is each part of its sum.",0
3.0,Not Up to the Author's Usual Standards,"November 11, 2018",No,"The Reckoning definitely represents a missed opportunity by the author, as it started out riveting and quickly went down hill.  Having read all of Grisham's novels, as well as legal thrillers from many other authors, I found the beginning of the book to be unique.  I did find the information about the Bataan Death March to be powerful and remarkably detailed, but the author never fully connects this time in Pete's life to his actions later.  The abrupt ending left me thinking I had skipped the last couple of pages.  The matter-the-fact way that the book was narrated took away from the suspense and kept the reader at an arm's length.  The Reckoning was an average read and one that I would be hesitant to recommend fully to other readers.",1
3.0,Should Have Been Two Books,"November 13, 2018",No,"There is a lot about this novel I enjoyed, and there is a lot that was a distraction. Most of all, it was my preconceived expectations that color my judgement. This is not a Grisham legal thriller as we understand. This is an historical mainstream novel with mystery elements, a why-dunnit rather than a whodunit.It gives Grisham a way to show off a different set of writing chops. However, it should have been sold differently so that it didn't meet such resistance...The backstory section set overseas should have remained that -- backstory. Or, it could have been a second, non-fiction book, or a separate section/afterward for this story. The structure as it is is cumbersome; while it's not really that long, the structure makes it feel that way. Had this been included as an afterward section, it would have been wonderful. It is a positive thing to revisit ugly historical events so we do not forget, especially those which haven't had the light shone on them in quite a while. Nevertheless, it slows the story considerably, and took away a full star from this review...As a commentary on post-war Southern society and life, this is a wonderful story. It shows the burdens of being constrained by heritage, and the relief of finally laying that burden down...This novel is for dedicated Grisham readers, or for those readers who don't especially love the ""usual"" John Grisham story...I listened to this on audiobook. Fantastic narration.",0
3.0,Strange novel better without horrid war story,"November 22, 2018",No,"The likes of authors Scott Turow, Steve Martini, and Phillip Margolin notwithstanding, Grisham is arguably the most renown writer of legal thrillers over the past two or three decades. We feel he is indeed a great storyteller, although we prefer his actual tales about lawyers and courtrooms to his unrelated fiction...“Reckoning” is Grisham’s latest in a bibliography now in excess of 40 novels. In three parts, the first, consuming half the book, details a cold-blooded murder by local WWII hero Pete Banning – a total shock to the community and his family, for which his motive is never revealed. The second part is a mere but depressingly brutal war story (featuring Banning) about the horrors in the Japanese takeover of the Philippines. It especially details the Bataan Death March, a subject apparently researched thoroughly by Grisham given the citations in his afterword. The third part is the “reveal”, frankly not particularly a total surprise except maybe for the named participants...We were not thrilled. The first part is way too long and boring. Then the war story was so inhuman, unless one has a burning desire to read yet another account of “war is hell”, we suspect it could be totally skipped with little detriment to the basic tale. Lastly, the outcome was not really that astonishing...So – cut part one in half, delete part two, and give us a little better part three, and you got yourself a pretty good novella!  {2.5}",0
2.0,I've read better Grisham stories....this was disapointing.,"November 20, 2018",No,"I usually love John Grisham books and thought this book would be a great read.  The book starts out really good and holds your interest but as you keep reading and reading (its a long book over 400 pages) it feels like Mr. Grisham got a little too off track.  The story starts out with the main character Pete Banning killing the town preacher and you're left trying to figure out the motive.  The middle of the book focuses on Pete's war history and bravery and the end of the book focuses on his children and how they are coping with everything..  I understand that Mr. Grisham was trying to show how Pete Banning became a war hero and maybe to support the fact the Pete was scarred by the war; but it just went on and on and on.  I kept reading because I was still waiting to here the motive behind the killing of the preacher that happened way back in chapter one of the book..  Four hundred pages into the book and the motive is revealed in the last three pages of the book!  I felt like I wasted a whole lot of time with a story that could have been shorter and that stayed on track.  And even after the motive was revealed you're still kinda left hanging, kinda like the characters just shrugged their shoulders and said...""Oh Well."".  I really like John Grisham books but this is one that I can't say I was pleased to read.  And I definitely felt let down by the time I finished the book.  I think the first part of the book was good, the  second part could have been shorter.  I don't think as much attention should have been paid to the second part  because it's kind of like a whole story by itself.; like someone is telling you a story,  getting off track, and then remembering the reason they started telling you the story in the first place.  The end of the book felt rushed and needed more story to it..  This is not one of John Grisham's better novels.",0
5.0,Best John Grisham ever? Better than Rainmaker?,"November 2, 2018",No,"This is the best book I have read in a long time. I would compare reading this book to finding a 100-carat stone at Crater of Diamonds State Park. All of Grisham's books are diamonds, but this one was a Wow (I read a lot of historical nonfiction, and his sections covering the Bataan Death March and associated events comprised the best historical fiction I have read to date). I appreciate any and all good fiction, because there's not that much available these days. My first note is about the sentence, ""After a tragedy, those with even the slightest connections to it often exaggerate their involvement and importance"" - because it struck me as humorous. Not humorous in the sense that tragedies are humorous. Rather, in the sense that I watched something similar happen in real life, although it was only a ""tragedy"" for one person and it was his own fault. Heck, the incident might have even done the individual some good - and he went on to become the CEO of a multi-million-dollar American corporation, who knows? The rest of the Grisham's latest novel is suspense to the very end, and a lie, lie, lie! (Sorry, if you've already read the book, you know what I'm talking about; hope that's not a spoiler.) My sense of humor kills me sometimes! :-) Oh yeah, I've had an internal struggle for the last few years concerning which of my favorite three novelists is the best, and Grisham just won, hands-down. Sorry, Sandford (Camp) and Crais.",0
1.0,Depressing and Pointless!,"November 13, 2018",No,"This book was so long boring and depressing,15 cd's !!! Nothing whatsoever redeeming or pleasant at all, just death, questions as to why things happened, no resolution until the very very end of the book. The resolution was horrible, I just felt so awful after listening to it for 3 days. I felt so misused by the author. I just kept hoping for things to work out in some way and he just left mewith sadness. I dont read to feel awful!",3
2.0,Disappointing Attempt at Southern Gothic,"October 28, 2018",No,"This is a story about the tragedy that befalls a family in a 1940’s small Mississippi cotton-town when a prominent farmer and decorated WWII hero inexplicably kills a local preacher and refuses to reveal the reason for the murder.  The tale stretches out for 400 pages before we finally come to the punch line --- what really happened, and why --- in the last three or four pages (so don’t read the end of the book first as some folks tend to do).  Along the way there is a pretty intense and extensive trek through the war hero’s time in the South Pacific as a prisoner who survived the Bataan Death March and his time in a Japanese concentration camp.  The most meaningful part of this book is that section which describes the inhumane Japanese treatment and tortures of POW’s as well as General MacArthur’s cowardice and duplicity as he abandoned his troops and fled the Philippines for the safety of Australia for the duration of the war.  These descriptions might give today’s young people, most of whom haven’t a clue and think war is just a video game, some idea about the real horrors of war and the bravery of our soldiers...Other than that, the book drags on for too long, and feels like a attempt to recreate a Faulkner-like Southern Gothic tale.  But somehow it seems to fall short.  Not one of Grisham’s best.",0
1.0,Disappointment,"October 26, 2018",No,"As a retired attorney from the South, I have read everything Grisham has written, &amp; while there have been a couple of misses (only to be expected when you consider the number of books he has written) this one is the worst.  In fact I did something I have never done with a Grisham book: I got to about a quarter of the book &amp; stop reading it.  There is no other word for it: it was just boring.  Nothing to hold my attention.  Sorry, John; better luck next time.",2
1.0,OVERPRICED,"November 7, 2018",No,"Why does a kindle version cost more ($14.99) than a Hardcover ($13.96).  Traditionally publishing houses pay a much smaller royalty (10-20%) than Kindle Publishing (35% or 70% depending on some options). Other than the initial formatting of the document for Kindle there are no expenses..So if the author receives a 15% royalty for a hardcover book that sells for $13.96 he/she would earn $2.094 for every book sold. If the same author chooses the 35% option and offers a kindle version of the same book for $14.99 he/she would earn $5.246 for each digital copy sold, or $10.493 at the 70% option minus some Amazon overhead..As a reader, I enjoy a good story and don’t mind paying a fair price to read the story. However, I don’t and won’t buy a book if I feel I’m being ripped off. I my mind the kindle version of the book should cost no more than $6.00 which would earn the author $2.10 at 35% which is a little more profitable than the hardcover; or $4.20 at 75% (minus some Amazon overhead)..I don’t mind paying a fair and reasonable price based on industry standards but these prices seem to be over the top. I like the author but refuse to buy an overpriced product.",0
5.0,Excellent!,"November 2, 2018",No,"John Grisham’s latest, the Reckoning, takes place in rural 1940s Mississippi. World War II veteran Pete Banning wakes up one day, goes about his business as usual and then proceeds to murder in cold blood the beloved preacher of the Methodist church. Pete refuses to tell anyone the reasons behind the killing and he and his family both suffer the consequences. The story also takes us back to Pete’s days as a war hero in the Philippines and also to the insane asylum inhabited by his wife...I’ve read most of Grisham’s books and I have to say that this was one of my favorites. It is suspenseful right up to the very last page. There are elements of the legal world, typical to Grisham’s works, but there is also some fascinating, if brutal and bloody, history of the Philippines in World War II, something I knew little about. After reading so many Works War II books centered around Nazi Germany, I found this to be a refreshing take. Overall, a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable read recommended to all. 5 stars!..Many thanks to Netgalley, Doubleday books and John Grisham for my complimentary e-copy ARC in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.",0
5.0,A Family destroyed by secrets.,"November 11, 2018",No,"A Family destroyed by secrets..The Reckoning by John Grisham is terrific—one of his very best.  An epic of sorts, it follows the fall of the Banning family of Clanton, Mississippi.  A proud southern family that is destroyed by personal secrets..Superb character development.  This is the hallmark of Mr. Grisham’s best literary works.  No shallow characters in The Reckoning, this is a classic study of southern honor and integrity gone bad destroying a proud southern family.  In the end, death is the only solace..No gratuitous sex, violence or language.  Just great writing..I’ve always though Mr. Grisham was an outstanding writer, but after his first few gripping novels he fell into the writer’s trap of standard repetitive fiction.  His recent Rooster Bar novel broke his string of formulaic legal thrillers and signaled Mr. Grisham’s return to his original energized thrillers.  Now with The Reckoning he has signaled a new renewed writing style and tempo.  The Reckoning is that good.  Well done sir, Well Done.  I am excitingly looking forward to your next novel.",0
4.0,Compelling,"December 2, 2018",No,"Peter Banning is a highly regarded member of the community and a World War II hero.  The whole town is shocked when he walks into Methodist pastor Dexter Bell's office and kills him with three well placed gun shots.  His only comment - I have nothing to say...When I first started this story, there was a small bit of humor to be found in Peter Banning's demeanor.  It made me think this might be different from other Grisham novels I've read.  And while it was different, it was not because there was much humor.  Things rapidly go downhill not only for Peter, but for his wife and two children.  And while this included the typical court room scenes, there was a lot of focus on Peter's history of becoming a war here and the impact his action had on his family...In many ways, this was a page turner.  Not so much for the legal suspense, but more so because I needed to have a better understanding of who Peter Banning was and how his family would survive.  When I turned the last page, all I could say was - Wow...My thanks to Doubleday Books and Netgalley.",0
4.0,Secrets,"December 6, 2018",No,"Some readers like popular authors to stay in a narrow lane and expect legal thrillers from John Grisham. His latest novel titled, The Reckoning, contains a legal case and more and may test those loyal readers who may not enjoy the “more” part. A large section of the novel is historical fiction, especially about the Bataan Death March. A third aspect of the novel involves the deep exploration of family dynamics. I think the third was the most important one for Grisham, since he ends the novel (no spoiler) with these words: “what a family.” Family dynamics involved keeping secrets from each other, with dramatic consequences. The energy in the novel comes from the ways in which Grisham draws us into the lives of a lot of family members. The plot momentum comes from the progress of legal cases with major consequences for the family. I enjoyed all aspects of the novel: the history, the trials, and the family dynamics, and I am pleased that Grisham veered outside the narrow lane with this book...Rating: Four-star (I like it)",0
3.0,Lots of Problems to Reckon With Here ...,"November 27, 2018",No,"First, let me say that I usually love John Grisham's books. I wish I could say that about this book, but it has way too many problems to make it a compelling story. Problem #1: The characters are all so lightly drawn that you don't feel you know any of them, and so you don't care about them or anything they do. Problem #2: Starting the book with the ending and then not explaining the ending until literally the last 2-3 pages of the book felt like a manipulation of the reader. Problem #3: The entire middle of the book about the Bataan Death March ... why? Not that it isn't an important part of WWII history, but it does absolutely nothing to advance the story. Problem #4: The over-explaining of the machinations of court procedures and lawyer strategy was not balanced out by character development so it was mostly a big yawn. Problem #5: That is hours of my life I will never get back and that always annoys me when I read a below average book like this,  so I am submitting this review hoping it will save others some time and money.",0
1.0,Don't waste time or money on this!,"November 23, 2018",No,"I was a fan of John Grisham.  He is certainly not a great writer, but his lawyer/courtroom novels were engrossing, and I have read all his books, I think.  The Reckoning is just awful.  Boring, plodding, repetitive, full of trite and stereotyped and uninteresting characters.  Long diatribes about capital punishment and arcane Mississippi laws and customs about miscegenation, and then a large section about the horrors of the Pacific islands in WWII, much of which I couldn't get through.  I read-skimmed through the entire story, hoping to find something redeeming, only to ask myself at the end, who cares?  Do not waste your time or money.  I truly wonder if it was written by someone else, not John Grisham.",1
1.0,Pretty bad!,"October 26, 2018",No,"My favorite Grisham books are Rainmaker, The Firm, and A Time to Kill.  None of the rest have measured up to those, in my opinion, and I should have known better than to pay for this book.  I was hoping for another good legal thriller in Clanton MS.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read in my life, and I had to skim major portions of it.  Very depressing, and much too wordy, on and on and on.....",2
1.0,Not The John Grisham I’ve Known and Loved,"November 5, 2018",No,"I always look forward to John Grisham’s books, and usually pre-order. I wish I had waited and read the reviews on this one. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the writing. After reading about one-third of the book, I did what one of the reviewers suggested, and skipped to the last few pages to find out what the motive was for Pete to kill the pastor. That way, I avoided the Bataan Death March section, which had I known was part of the book, would never had purchased. From the reviews I’ve read, many readers felt the same way. I’ll definitely read the reviews before I buy his next one.",2
1.0,Awful,"November 3, 2018",No,"I was not planning on reading a horrible,graphic tale of the Bataan death march. I hated that part of the book and ended up skipping over it. This book has no redeeming value.",4
3.0,Disappointed,"November 6, 2018",No,"I'm reviewing the Audiobook.  I have read almost all of Grisham's books and enjoyed most of them.  I was really looking forward to this one because I loved the previous Ford County books and I was excited to see that Michael Beck was the narrator once again.  His narration was really the only saving grace for this book.  Where to begin?  Character development was very weak.  The only two characters that I found the least bit interesting were Nineveh and Florry.  John Wilbanks was boring and I kept hoping that, sooner or later, we'd see some of the fire and eccentricities of Lucian, but they never materialized.  Too much time was spent on Pete's experiences in WWII.  It slowed the story down and, at times, felt like a different book.  Much of the plot was very predictable and just didn't offer any of the classic Grisham twists and turns of his previous books.  Overall, I feel the plot was overly padded in some areas and underdeveloped in others.  Not my favorite Grisham. :/",0
1.0,Depressing,"October 27, 2018",No,"Two-thirds of the way through this book, I started thinking about how it might finish. What twist or turn would justify the depressing slog through hundreds of pages of human misery.  Nope. Grisham lays waste to just about everything before the survivors of this emotional train wreck crawl away. A well written awful story.",3
3.0,Seriously conflicted,"November 4, 2018",No,"I've been a fan of John Grisham since the very first novel. I have all of them; each year I eagerly await October for the latest missive. Like many Grisham fans, I prefer his earlier novels and have read them all more than once. His more recent efforts haven't been quite as compelling but there have been a few definite hits and some dubious misses. We are used to not always getting the traditional happy ending in his later works but there's usually some form of redemption that helps us to feel better about what took place earlier - such as The Confession. But none of his books has EVER left me as conflicted as The Reckoning...It starts so wonderfully. A killing that makes absolutely no sense, and the killer simply won't allow his lawyer (of Wilbanks family fame) to mount a defense. We, along with everyone in Clanton, speculate wildly about what could have caused this much-loved family man, war hero and prominent citizen to do what he did. You figure that when the reveal comes, it'll be jaw-dropping...Then we're treated to a flashback about our hero's time in the Philippines. Graphic descriptions of the Bataan Death Match, life as a POW in O'Donnell and subsequent guerilla fighting - it's seriously compelling, a great section of the book and a history lesson if, like me, you didn't know much about the US Armed Forces in the Philippines during WW2. And with all our hero suffers, you figure it has to have a significant bearing on his reason for murder - otherwise why is there so much time and detail dedicated to it?..The reveal, when it finally comes in the third section, was enough to make me exclaim in anger. What had been an astonishing read up until that point and left me literally unable to put the book down ends in such a way as to make you think one thing: WTF?!?!?!..This book is a compelling, gripping read that SERIOUSLY disappoints. Read it, and you'll understand.",1
1.0,I Think I’m Done With Grisham,"November 26, 2018",No,"- NO MAJOR SPOILERS -..If I wanted to read a nonfictional or even historical fictional account of the atrocities committed by the Japanese during WWII, I would have done so. The detailed violence was overwhelming and while I doubt inaccurate, still extremely disturbing and not something I would have wanted to ever read about. Alas, I kept reading thinking that this information would all somehow tie together to make fantastic ending... nope, it had absolutely nothing to really do with the story. Literally over 100 pages of irrelevance. So many other details and characters were drawn out with intense detail but again found to be completely irrelevant and unnecessary. And the ending? Very abrupt and rather predictable. First Sycamore Row and now this.... I think this will be my last Grisham book. He has definitely lost his touch. The only upside is that I got my copy from the library and didn’t spend a dime. Thank goodness.",0
1.0,This is not what you think it is,"October 24, 2018",No,"I've always enjoyed this authors novels--until now.This book just doesn't live up to the authors reputation.Don't purchase this book,get it from your local library.",4
5.0,Deep South Heroes of WWII. MacArthur was a #Fail. Bataan Death March.,"November 17, 2018",No,"The book begins with a true 'smdh' mystery -- complete with Southern prototypes up the wazoo -- and veers off into a backstory of the Bataan Death March before returning to the misery . . . excuse me . . . Mystery at hand..After about 10 pages, this unexpected third of the book was Stunning! I stopped to do a little research and found that the author did not exaggerate in the least. By the time we return to the murder plot, I was exhausted from the trials, tribulations and the suspense..I loved a small literary device which was used in the book: when the scout or runner was whispering in extreme sotto voce life and death information to the hero in the Philippine mountains Grisham, or the editor,  did not use quote marks..Grisham writes in such a sincere manner that you normally do not note the devices and syntax while your are reading.  You are there.  That is truly an amazing talent and skill.",0
1.0,"Devoted Grisham reader, disappointed with this one","November 19, 2018",No,"As a devoted Grisham reader, I was hoping for more of his legal suspense. Not here. He's about three rewrites short of a significant contribution to Southern post-WWII. I'm a book editor, and this is what I tell some of my authors: ""This isn't there yet."" His characters could be magnificent, but they fall short of doing anything. The three parts of the book are disjointed and awkward. He needs a brutal editor to rework the real story thread and get to the mystery solved part. Too much setup, too much driving back and forth and train rides without meat.",1
2.0,"""Another Grisham Letdown""","October 28, 2018",No,The setup was great with the expectation of a great payoff which never happened.  A whole lot of exciting World War II backstory that served more as filler to flush out the book.  The ending fizzled out after being strung along way too long.  All in all - a very disappointing letdown which ended as a whimper rather than a bang.  That's a couple Grisham books in a row that weren't worth my time or money.,2
1.0,Compelling beginning to the novel but...,"November 13, 2018",No,"I was really compelled by this book at first but then it took several wrong turns.  Like other 1 star reviews mentioned, the wartime narrative was way too long, and then the book just became uninteresting. The big reveal fell very flat after all that.  It's too bad that he wasted a really good first 1/3 of a book.",4
4.0,Don't be fooled by the plot!,"December 4, 2018",No,"Unlike many reviewers, I think this is one of Grisham's best. As a teacher of literature, I look for more than just fast action. What Grisham does is, I think, good. The first part of the book give us the event, the consequences, but not the why of the action. The picture we get of the main character leads us to be puzzled, asking exactly what his neighbors and others asked: why???  Part II takes us to WW2 and we follow the war, and the main character, Pete Banning in a battle than ends in the USA's surrender to Japan on Bataan, and the horrendous Bataan Death March. This section was especially well done.  Grisham gives nothing away. Several times I was sure I knew what/why, and I was always wrong. The ending is a pleasant surprise in that it is how life really is.  Most readers want a happily ever after resolution to a plot. Grisham gives us reality.",0
3.0,The Reckoning,"November 4, 2018",No,"I found most of this book intense and engrossing. Although it took me a few days to read, I couldn't wait to pick it back up each evening. Until the ending. What I thought would be a five star story was reduced to just an average read. The ending was so steriotypical of books about the South that it ruined it for me. My goodness, how could poor Pete ever be told the actual truth (sarcasm)! And in every way possible the ending was so sad for so many people. No silver lining; everything was lost..I miss rhe early John Grishom books.....",1
1.0,May Be Grisham's Worst,"November 6, 2018",No,"Condensed version. Husband (H), from Mississippi serves in World War II.  H reported missing in action, wife (W) has an affair with an African American worker on family cotton farm. W has abortion and develops infection. H comes home, W disinterested due to condition. H confronts W and W says it was the preacher. W sent to mental institution. H depressed and blows preacher away. H sentenced to electric chair and reader gets graphic details of execution. W escapes institution and commits suicide. Preacher’s wife sues family for wrongful death and takes everything, including family farm, where she moves into mansion (H had fraudulently deeded it to children). H’s sister dies from heart failure. Within the depressing 400 pages is a lot of rather meaningless description.  This book is selling on Grisham's reputation, John Frisham wouldn't sell 10,000 copies.",0
4.0,Three stories in one,"November 30, 2018",No,"At least three stories here, finally brought together fairly nicely at the end. After about 40% and an early climax, the story shifts dramatically to fill in some gaps, and also to delve into something totally different...While the middle third or so was somewhat unrelated to the overall storyline (just because of the level of detail), I found it mostly interesting. Others might disagree...Quite a different approach than most Grishsm novels. But the author found two major topics he wanted to write about and brought them together in one book...Grisham's later works don't have the page-turning characteristic of this earlier books, but they are mostly entertaining. They are lately more place and time stories than action-packed thrillers, but enjoyable in their own way.",0
3.0,Great for WW II history buffs--but not Grisham's best,"November 12, 2018",No,"The Reckoning is a story told in three parts, each one quite different from the last, almost like three independent stories.  Grisham undoubtedly arouses our curiosity in the first section--but we have to read to the end to satisfy it, and the last section seems padded and drags interminably...Any lover of World War II military history will be enamored with the middle section, which is a well-researched and fascinating look at the Bataan March and the war in the Philippines in the 1940s, viewed through the eyes of his protagonist...It would be most unfair to give a one-star or two-star review to this book.  Grisham is, after all, a hugely talented writer.  His characters are well drawn and memorable.  This book, however, is not his best.",0
1.0,(DEAD) Reckoning completely off course,"November 28, 2018",No,"Previously I have quite enjoyed Mr. Grisham's work and his depth of research and knowledge of the subject. This book, while it did provide enormous amounts of research regarding guerrilla warfare in the Philippines during WW2, was an utter disappointment. Perhaps this story needed to take another route because the disjointed story telling in the book was complete rubbish. Mr Grishams's acknowledged source of the inspiration for this story was overheard stolen gossip. One would think such well respected author of the South would know that gossip is only meant to be whispered over sweet tea and under the shade of tall porches and not committed to paper. I can only suggest that others avoid wasting time on this ""novel"" which was neither novel nor good.",0
5.0,Wow-very interesting read,"October 28, 2018",No,"This story grabbed me from the start and, while it was a different type of book for Grisham, the history was fascinating, horrifying and important. It really makes you examine your views on different subjects. I have a new understanding of that time period and now want to read more about it from other sources.  As far as the story itself, it was somehow simultaneously unbelievable and relatable..And now, as happens after virtually every Grisham new release, I want to go back and read his other novels all over again.",1
1.0,Very Boring,"November 4, 2018",No,"I can't get through this book. Normally I can devour a Grisham novel in a week end but I have been at this one for 2 weeks. It is simply not holding my attention. The characters seem emotionless, the dialogue plodding and unrealistic. I will try to finish this book because I paid money to do so, but maybe this review will help someone else save theirs.",4
5.0,Another great read by John Grisham.,"November 12, 2018",No,"I've read all of John Grisham's books and am always relieved to learn of another forthcoming release..""The Reckoning"" was yet another change in format--just as I thought I knew the plot, the characters, their pasts, this book kept evolving into a much deeper and enriched story..My father was in World War II, fought the Japanese in the mountains of China, never uttering one word to me or my siblings about his war experiences. He was graduated early from high school as the military needed soldiers, joining the Marines while his classmates still had months before graduation. I have known several of his generation who fought in the Philippines who also never uttered a word about their war experiences. I've watched TV programs, some with historical footage, some with video recreations of the Bataan Death March. This background helped me visualize Grisham's telling of his character's journey. I consider this book to be a tribute to the Greatest Generation, those who were on the battlefield, and those who remained stateside. Like in life, sometimes what we do or don't know does make a defining difference..I highly recommend ""The Reckoning"" -- it was not a predictable read.",0
4.0,3 part story that is almost 3 different stories,"November 15, 2018",No,"I just finished John Grisham's newest novel ""The Reckoning"".  It is interesting but I feel will appeal to his male fans much more then his female fans.  The book is in 3 parts...Part one is typical Grisham.  The crime, the court battles, the punishment... Part 2 is a flash back to the Bataan Death March in the Philippines.  Where I appreciate learning more then what a history book tells you,  I feel that this is really heavy and bogged down with way too much military history.  Unless you have a huge fascination with military procedures and/or WW2 Pacific Base interests, this section gets very bogged down...Then part 3 is a culmination of part 1 with little of part 2 even mentioned.  Sufficed to say, Pete was at war, and leave it there...It is a good story.  And I am sure Mr. Grisham is looking to write in ways he has written in the ways he hasn't explored before.  But this is Definately not one of my top 5 Grishams.",0
3.0,Depressing,"November 15, 2018",No,"I listened to the book on long commutes.  Written in three parts it tells the tragic story of the current generation of a family that has grown cotton on a large farm in northern Mississippi for generations.  Part II of the book is based in the Philippines during World War II and describes the  inhumane details of the March of Bataan.  Grisham was harsh in his criticism of General MacArthur.  It was painful to listen to but I believe that Grisham did his research and found it educational.  I gave ""The Reckoning"" 3 stars because of the first and last parts, which dealt with the family.  When I finished I was truly depressed.  I don't recommend the book.  Instead, do some research about MacArthur and his mistakes in the Philippines.",0
1.0,Goes nowhere....big disappointment,"November 27, 2018",No,"I bought this as an audio book.  After listening to five chapters and the story going absolutely nowhere, wondering if it was just me, I went to see other reviews. I am in the majority...this is a terrible book.  if you have NO other books, NO other audio selections and bored, go ahead and spend your time and money on this.  If you have ANY other options, take a fast pass.  This is nowhere close to Grisham's other excellent books (Sycamore Tree was good from first to last page).  Listening to this made me feel like I was walking in place....the story never moved, the plot never developed, and different characters just kept saying the same thing over and over.  Big disappointment.  I returned this.",0
2.0,The subject matter and plot were too depressing for me.,"October 31, 2018",No,"I bought the Audible version and, although well written and well narrated, the subject matter and the storyline was just too depressing for me.  Usually any new John Grisham novel release is one of the highlights of any of my years, as are most movies based on his books.  So I had looked forward to this one for a long time.  However, after listening to several of the chapters, to the point I decided to quit, I then skipped to the end to see if it perhaps the ending redeemed it enough for me to go back to my stopping point and continue.  It did not.  I subscribe to two Audible book credits per month, and fortunately, Audible has a good return policy and returned the credit with which I had purchased this book.  I want the ""old"" Grisham back.",0
1.0,Depressing mess!,"December 4, 2018",No,"Grisham is running out of steam.  The Reckoning starts out slowly and with no buoyancy of mystery or emotional pique.  Characters are wooden and plot is all but nonexistent.  Deadline from his publisher - ?? - only way to explain why 60% of the book is devoted to excruciating detail of horrific war experience, which contributes almost nothing to the thin story line which is itself a depressing snapshot of a colorless group of characters.  Consistent with his history there is a legal backdrop but the degree of minutial procedural detail is numbing.  The entire story could be told in 20 pages but then even it would be boring and dreary.  The ending ""twist"" is mildly surprising but only because there is absolutely no previous clue.  I believe I have read all his previous stuff and like all the prolific writers some is better than others but how this one got to market can only be explained by a greedy system.  Shameful play on the writer's reputation.  I feel abused and am going to return it for a refund!",0
1.0,TMI,"October 27, 2018",No,why cant people review a book without telling the story! Now i dont have to read it because i already know whats going on.,3
2.0,Definitely NOT Grisham's best,"November 7, 2018",No,"I love most of Grisham's work.  This one fell disappointingly flat.  You had an idea of the ending by 40%.  Then it drones on about the horrors of World War II.  A little too graphic for me.  I was looking for a legal thriller.  If I  had wanted in a lesson on World War II, I would have purchased a non-fiction book about it.  This was way too predictable, and the gory stuff in the beginning and the end just wasn't necessary.",1
1.0,A Tedious Tale,"November 11, 2018",No,"John Grisham is a great novelist and storyteller so when he creates a morbid, dark, depressing tale in ‘The Reckoning’ it becomes a mystery unto itself.  Why a gifted writer would waste precious words on this story is unimaginable.  In ‘The Reckoning’ he catalogues, in excruciating detail, the horrors of war, and the selfish mean spirited inclinations of his characters by detailing the pain and suffering of two generations of the Banning family of Clanton, Mississippi.  This result is a tedious, convoluted, dark, mysterious and unfulfilling story.  The tragedy is that Grisham’s work is cherished by millions and he is clearly capable of so much more.",1
1.0,I Surrendered,"November 10, 2018",No,I plowed thru the first 180 pages hoping at some point that the story would pick up but I gave up and skipped to the last 50 pages...I read all of Grisham's books and this is by far the worst ....... would not receommend.,3
4.0,Classic.,"October 29, 2018",No,"For the Grisham fan, it is not unusual to drop whatever else you are reading and buzz through his new release. Frankly I'm surprised at the split in opinion on this book as I have found that Grisham at his worst is eminently more readable than most authors. The story flows, the characters are believable, enough villains and good folks to keep you rooting for the obvious outcomes and enough elements to entertain most readers - Southern history in the 40's, interesting overview of the war in the Philippines and the legal twists he is known for. A good read, obviously. I barreled through in 3 days despite attending a fun wedding in PA.",0
1.0,Don't waste your money or time,"November 27, 2018",No,"This is one of the most thoroughly boring books I've ever read. None of the characters are sympathetic (ALL the women do nothing but cry), no one is pro active. Frankly if Pete Banning was so intent on dying why the hell didn't he commit suicide instead of costing the legal system (as well as the reader) hours and hours or boredom. I hung on until the last few pages, hoping that there would be some sort of resolution that could have explained all the hysteria, but then just ditched the book because I simply didn't care...and because there are so many really GOOD books out there to be read. This is really, really, a bad book!",0
5.0,Three Stories in One,"December 6, 2018",No,"In enjoyed this novel but I am biased since I like Grisham's writing.  It reflects an era that I grew up in and can identify with.  It is less a mystery than an accounting of social systems in the l940 to 1960s.  The idea of going to one's grave with a secret may not be new but why this happens tells us something about social conditions of the times.  Also, Grisham's treatment of certain religious denominations is always wryly funny.  His treatment of WWII in the Pacific has been criticized by some literary buffs. However, this part of the story helps to explain the character of the central protagonist.",0
1.0,"Boring, boring, boring!","November 10, 2018",No,"I love John Grisham and have read every one of his books. This is a boring, pointless book. The story about the war was gruesome and I skipped the whole section. I kept waiting for something of interest to happen. . .. it NEVER did!",2
1.0,Don't read this whole boring book to find out the big family secret. Because even it Sucked!,"November 20, 2018",No,I've read all of Grisham books loved almost all of them. This is one of the most boring books I ever read! And the last chapter that I read the whole boring book for was so stupid. I threw the book in the trash and didn't donate because i don't want anybody else to waste their time reading this book. Definitely will not be wasting  my money on another Grisham book.,3
1.0,Not at all interesting to read,"October 27, 2018",No,"The book was boring and the characters were empty. I had thought initially that Pete might have been presented as an early case of PTSD. But no.  Pete turns out to be an unforgiving, Southern not-so-gentleman. The facts of the case, finally given at the very ending, we're unlikely and trashy.",2
4.0,Great story with great demonstration of the power of a lie,"November 25, 2018",No,"The plot is engaging and fast moving....until you reach Part II....then it becomes a history lesson and detailed description of life in the jungles of the Pacific during WWII as an escaped POW....while this does have some connection to the plot it is really a secondary part and only serves to fill up pages and several chapters with excess storytelling. Part III returns to the true plot and closes with a strong and page turning story which truly displays the damage that a single lie can bring. Part I and III are 5 stars, Part II is 2 stars.....so overall it's a 4 Star book.",0
3.0,"Great read, but...","November 13, 2018",No,"While I really liked the book and have liked Grisham for years, this particular book could have been shortened and still told the story well.  Parts 1 and 3 would have fit together better if Part 2 was shorter and less detailed.  While I appreciated the additional WWII history lesson  in Part 2 (who knew MacArthur wasn't the stellar soldier history would like us to believe?), the entire story didn't fit well with the rest of the book.  There is an unexpected twist in the last 5 chapters that kept me reading.  Otherwise, it was a very long (and heavy) book.",0
4.0,End of the line,"November 7, 2018",No,"THE RECKONING is a sad story of the unraveling of an illustrious Southern family; at the same time the book is a well-written and compelling tale by John Grisham, master of legally-themed novels. I enjoyed every moment, from the book's shocking first chapter to its final resolution, hardly a happy ending for the Bannings. If you love Grisham, you'll enjoy the book. Many scenes take place in courtrooms, the setting is the Deep South of Mississippi, there is much family history, along with fascinating characters--all hallmarks of Grisham's writing.",0
5.0,Grisham is a good storyteller....,"November 9, 2018",No,"Taking place in 1940s rural Mississippi, this is not a typical Grisham courtroom drama.  I would say Southern gothic comes closer to describing the genre...Grisham is a good story teller and he captures the essence of small town America.  The book is divided into three parts, with the middle part describing the Bataan death march and its aftermath in which the family patriarch participated.  The war scenes are brutal but realistic and a good reminder that war is indeed hell.  This section is long and may not be to everyone’s liking.",0
2.0,Very disappointed,"November 19, 2018",No,"As a fan of all of John Grisham’s work, this was a long awaited read..Maybe I should have waited longer..I was disappointed-yes, descriptions of actual events were poignant, but the heart of the matter is you don’t care about the characters enough for it to mean what Grisham is telling..Overly long, it is not a satisfying read. What could have been a fine novel with the South almost as a main character, his ending leaves us as empty as some of the characters we wish we could have empathized with.",0
2.0,More a war story than a legal mystery.,"November 10, 2018",No,"Being a Grisham fan, I did not bother to read a review before diving into the book.  I was surprised to find myself deep in the Philappines during WW2, the Bataan Death March and the horrors of a prisoner of war camp..  There isn't much of a mystery, and it's a painful schlog getting there.  Most of the usual Grisham legal suspense in not in play here - just a bit of a straightforward trial and appeals - and no surprises until the last page, which - given the horror of the WW2 sequence - seems pretty irrelevant.",0
2.0,Don’t hurry to read this one,"November 14, 2018",No,"Now that I’m convinced John Grisham has a stable of assistants researching his ideas which JG then knits together with a storyline.(many bestselling authors do this) ...the problem with this book is there is almost no story, save the history lesson within.  Go-nowhere story and an ending you can guess a mile away, this is the least entertaining Grisham book I’ve ever read. Uninteresting characters and a drawn out conclusion with no teeth, at least I did learn the part of war history I hadn’t learned about in school.",0
1.0,Too Long And Boring,"October 28, 2018",No,This story could have been thoroughly told in an article or just two chapters instead of a book.  The author must be hard up for material if he has come to this.,2
1.0,The Reckoning by John Grisham,"November 12, 2018",No,"Grisham has always been one if my favorite authors. I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was so disappointed, it was awful. All the section on Bataan and the Philippines felt like filler. The ""secret"" was trite and totally predictable. Definitely do not recommend. Waste of my time.",2
5.0,Not typical Grisham,"November 23, 2018",No,"The last sentence of this book says it all. “What a family.”  While I expected the typical legal drama of Grisham, I did not expect the depth to which he examined the intertwinings of characters in a family.”  With the Bataan Death March (good history lesson) as the pivotal scene in this novel, the lives of one family turned from comfortable to chaotic. Tragedy becomes the “norm” in a well-plotted story, albeit not the story I was expecting. Although Grisham’s characters are adequately described (I had an image of each of them), I really wanted to learn more from the main character. However, therein lies part of the family dynamics which Grisham portrays. It was page-turner to the end.",0
1.0,Couldn't slog through it,"November 19, 2018",No,"I made it through chapter 7 and cared so little for the characters that I finally checked the reviews for the book to see if others said it got better. Not so much. When I read that the whole middle section concerned WWII, I gave up and skipped to the last chapter to find out why he killed Reverend Bell. This is the first Grisham book I didn't finish. Just not interested in war stories and thought the part of the book I DID read was just too long and could have been edited to a much shorter story.",1
3.0,Not what I was expecting,"November 4, 2018",No,"The Reckoning by John Grisham.  Not taut thriller courtroom drama I was expecting from Mr Grisham.  Couldn't relate to the characters and wasn't drawn into the story.  I'm sure other people will enjoy it...Thank you to the publisher, author, and NetGalley for the opportunity to preview the book.",1
5.0,A Novel You Just Can't Put Down,"November 19, 2018",No,"I've read all of Grisham's novels, wouldn't want to miss one.  This book had me reading late into the night keeping me captivated to the end.  The story is divided into 3 parts, each moving in such a way as to keep the reader turning pages without thoughts of taking a break.  Part 2 has a fascinating, albeit horrifying, story about the Bataan Death March, which was in the Philippines, during WWII.  Don't cheat yourself by not reading this latest book by John Grisham.",0
4.0,Grisham has done it again,"October 24, 2018",No,"The Reckoning by John Grisham. Grisham has done it again by writing a great story, leading you by the nose right till the end before he puts in his twist. An insightful story into that time and history and as always leads you thinking - What if the truth had just been told from the beginning.",1
4.0,"Not his normal, but that's OK... very good!","November 9, 2018",No,"I knew that a lot of John Grisham's fans would not like this book and that's pretty evident from some of the reviews.  Can an author or actor and really anyone, go outside their normal box and be successful?  I think so and it requires the reader to open up their mind.  I have read all of Mr. Grisham's books and enjoyed them all.  I have also read many books depicting WWII.  I thought he did an excellent job of  bringing this story together and showing the average reader the horrors of war.  This was also a different time period when what we think as no big deal today was very dangerous then.  I say worth the time and your attention.",0
4.0,A Tragic Web of Unjusts....,"November 25, 2018",No,"While I will agree with other reviewers that this book is a departure from Mr. Grisham's other novels, I enjoyed this book immensely. There are so many threads that are intertwined that make up the fabric of Mr. Banning. The Death March of Bataan was particularly interesting as I had no knowledge of this chapter of World War II. I felt that by the end of this book, I understood who the man was, why he was who he was, and what his principles were, based on his life experiences. Thank you once again for an entertaining read Mr. Grisham.",0
3.0,Lesser Than the Pelican Brief,"November 1, 2018",No,"We-written as always, this book has most of the earmarks of a John Grisham novel, but the basic plot had to make a considerable detour -- a sort of a ""To Hell and Back"" interlude -- to boost it from novella to novel.  In his afterword, Grisham acknowledged all his sources for the long interlude about the inhumane treatment of U.S. Prisoners of War in the Phillipines.  I thought it was an excessive detour and would rate the book 'good ' but not 'great '..Ed Nichols",0
3.0,A little disappointing,"November 13, 2018",No,"I am a pretty big JG fan, and have been for 11 years and have read just about every book he wrote. This was by far the worst in my opinion. The storyline dragged on immensely. The entire middle section of the book, albeit interesting, was completely unnecessary to the plot. I gave it 3 stars because he does a great job with imagery, and the story is told in such a way that you feel like you are there and the book kept you intrigued to find out the truth, and when the story finally got to it, it was underwhelming and predictable. The twist was what i figured 300 pages prior. I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re not a fan of Grisham. He has several much better written books to choose from.",1
2.0,A depressing family story,"October 27, 2018",No,I am a big Grisham fan and I pre-order every one of his books. So I dug into The Reckoning as soon as it hit my Kindle this week. It was an interesting history lesson for this baby boomer but a dud as a legal thriller. It was a real depressing story for the Banning family that left me with a real empty feeling. But I'll anxiously await the next one.,2
1.0,Terrible,"October 24, 2018",No,Do not waste your money.,4
1.0,Worst Grisham book so far.,"November 17, 2018",No,I read his books for their character portrayals. These characters were one dimensional. If you are old enough to remember Mandingo this book became Mandingo meets the Bataan Death March.  First 10 pages telegraphs the ending and it took to the last 10 pages to confirm it.,1
2.0,Didn’t like but can’t forget,"November 16, 2018",No,"I kept thinking “this can’t happen”...and then it kept on happening.  Tragic.  Heroic.  Arrogant.  Terribly damaged characters.  Although I hated turning the pages, I couldn’t stop.  A depression trip, at best.  As an aging southerner, I am sure that the hastily wrapped up conclusion was untenable; the last nail in that coffin just wouldn’t have been driven.  Although it wasn’t the Grisham that I anticipated, the story haunts me still.",0
3.0,Baatan death march was the best part,"November 25, 2018",No,"While I didn't hate it, I didn't get as much from it as I normally do from Grisham.  I still don't really understand why Pete shot the minister.  Did he think the wife had been brutally raped or had a consensual affair?  So the miscegenation at the end came in out of left field and really didn't wrap this up or explain why the wife went into her long twilight.  I liked his evocation of farm life in Mississippi.",0
1.0,Worst Grisham ever.  Bataan Death March minute by minute.,"November 22, 2018",No,"10% of this book is, what seemed like, a minute by minute description of the many year Bataan Death March...seriously..Had to put that first. Had to..I have read all of Grisham's books and enjoy 95%...this one had no point, no suspense..Basically, everything happened as predicted and the big secrets section (95% in to save you hours of this dreck) is so boring that I wish I could have my 3 days back.",0
1.0,Was not”a good read”.,"November 19, 2018",No,I’m so glad I have an ereader. I could scroll through the sections of part two that had little to do with the plot.  I expectantly wait for a new book that will totally involve me. I’ve read them all. This was the least riveting and engrossing. I long to be transported and transfixed.  I hate to say this but  it was the worst..  I think he was indulging himself in writing this middle section. He really didn’t think of the reader’s quest for “a good read”.,1
2.0,Two entirely different stories,"November 7, 2018",No,"I've read and enjoyed many Grisham books, but ""The Reckoning"" is fundamentally different from his other books.  It's actually two different stories which have a minimal connection.  The primary story ( parts 1 and 3) takes place in Mississippi, and is engaging enough. But part 2 is a detailed account of one character's experience in the Philippines during World War II, including the Bataan death march. According to his afterword, Grisham did extensive research on this subject, and he wrote about the character's experience in great detail.  However, the only way this ties into the primary storyline is to make the point that the character experienced horrific things during the war and came back a  different man.  And while this might possibly be argued, his experience really didn't impact his action once he returned home.  So the story told in parts 1 and 3, with perhaps a short chapter about Pete's war experience,  could have stood alone, and would have been a better story.  The length and detail in part 2 was a disturbing distraction that served no purpose in the telling of the story.",0
1.0,This book is for you if you like seeing people suffer for incredibly stupid reasons.,"December 4, 2018",No,"It is like the Gift of the Magi in that it has an ironic twist at the end.  But instead of being heart warming, it is horrifying--like watching a slow motion train wreck that kills all on board.  This might...might have been an okay short story, but my goodness not a novel--especially such a long boring one.  I have always enjoyed Gresham's novels before, but this one was so bad I might never pick up another.",0
1.0,Don’t bother,"October 26, 2018",No,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Shame on you, John Grisham!",9
5.0,Grisham’s best book yet.,"November 13, 2018",No,"This book took off at the very beginning, which I was very pleased because if it doesn’t grab me in the beginning I won’t read it.  I enjoyed reading about the Bataan Death March and what all the prisoners went through.  I like war movies/books so this was intriguing for me.  The ending blew my mind!!  I never would have thought for a moment the story would end that way.  This is one of those books where the next book is really going to have to be good to keep my attention.  This is a must read.",0
2.0,Disappointing,"November 11, 2018",No,"Having read, and in many cases, re-read every one of John Grisham's books, this was a huge disappointment. The first third of the novel started out interesting and compelling, setting the stage for a good mystery to be solved. The middle third of the book was entirely set during WWII with the main character fighting, being captured and tortured by the Japanese in graphic detail. The final third of the book finally started wrapping up the original plot and ended with a flat, disappointing conclusion. I will always be a John Grisham fan, and look forward to his next book. But this was a departure from what we've come to expect from him.",0
5.0,Southern Tales,"November 5, 2018",No,"After Rooster Bar and Camino Island I almost gave up on Grisham but when my daughter told me a lot of The Recckoning was about the Filipino campaign in WW two , my interest peaked. This is old style Grisham and it gets full kudos. Great storyline and character development. You will not be disappointed. Since I’ve read all his books, small advice. Give up formulaic and get back to Southern storytelling novels.",0
5.0,Caught my attention!,"November 1, 2018",No,Enjoyed listening to this book!  Some parts a bit challenging for me but overall I truly enjoyed this story.  Written in a unique style that seems to support telling the tale.  I say challenging because I’m not fond of war stories being told in such vivid reality.  I learned a LOT.  The twists at the end really surprised me.  Interesting how the pitfalls of the characters are all understood by the last page.,0
1.0,Really??,"November 14, 2018",No,"What a mess of a book. Everyone in the novel guessed the ""secret""-or a form of it--half way through the novel.  And the war in the Pacific? How did that get folded into a story about a murder?  I wish I'd read these reviews before ordering this book.",2
1.0,Terrible story.,"November 19, 2018",No,"I have read all John Grisham's previous books except for the kiddie books.  Most are 5 star and great reads, but I was so depressed after reading the 1st section of ""The Reckoning"" that I stopped reading it.  NOT A PLEASURE AT ALL.",1
5.0,This is an expansive review of the US war in the Pacific and the. Effect on one Mississippi family,"November 3, 2018",No,The first third of the book is a confusing tale of a Mississippi vottor farmer that returns from WWII and decides to kill the local Methodist preacher.  The heart of the story involves the experience of US service men in the Philippines and the Bataan death march that was part of the conflict...The reader needs patience to finish the book completely in order to make some sense of the tale..,0
3.0,Well worth reading,"November 13, 2018",No,I was torn between giving this book a 3 or a 4 star rating.  The ending was not so surprising and I think that the time spent setting up of Pete's homecoming was a little much too drawn out.  The fact that the author spent so much time telling you about the death March to battan really didn't make sense even though I guess he was trying to set up a ptsd scenario.  All in all this was a good book.,0
2.0,I don’t recommend...,"November 27, 2018",No,"This book is a huge disappointment. I had hope that Grisham had gotten his mojo back after the last two books that weren’t his finest, but my hopes were dashed. After a decent start, things spiral downward with a lengthy section about war and the Bataan Death March. That part is much too long &amp; difficult to read..The conclusion of the story rather unsatisfactorily reveals the answer to a mystery that is central to the story. Instead of wrapping up, it merely fizzles out.",0
3.0,Not your father's Grisham novel,"November 2, 2018",No,"I've read all of Grisham's legal novels. The Reckoning was supposed to be one, however, a third of the way through this longer-than-usual Grisham novel, the story took a left turn and became a war novel with pages of non-character and non-plot driven historical information. I put up with it, hoping something would happen that would be relevant when the book's ""secrets"" were finally revealed. None of the war stuff was useful in explaining the lead character's motivation for his conduct during the first third of the book. I don't read war stories or watch war movies so I was very disappointed by this deviation from the successful Grisham formula.",0
1.0,Waste. Of. Time.,"November 24, 2018",No,"I approach each Grisham novel with eager anticipation, with the certainty that there is going to be a damn good story, and that I am going to lose sleep because I just cannot put it down. This one disappoints profoundly. It is a mess. It took sheer force of will to read the last two hundred pages, knowing that the story behind the murder would be gloriously revealed. And then, THAT ending? What a disappointment, what a wasteof time. Read this only if you are a Grisham hound who MUST. Otherwise, save yourself twenty bucks and nine hours.",1
1.0,2 thumbs down,"November 9, 2018",No,"I loved all his prior books so ordered this in hardback so I could share with family; however, it is going to Goodwill.  Meandering plot, characters I never cared about and with no redeeming qualities.  This book was a waste of time and money.",1
3.0,The long read to the truth,"November 30, 2018",No,"I love Grisham's books but this is not one of his best.  Although I liked the way he wove in history from the Second World War, (and that was difficult to read), it felt like it took way too long to get to the crux of the story.  Character development was good, especially Pete since there is really no way to understand how one would recover from such hideous treatment.  Definitely wasn't one of Grisham's normal page turner, can't put it down type reads.",0
1.0,Too long and boring,"November 19, 2018",No,"I usually read any new Grisham book as soon as it comes out. This one is way too long, too detailed without a compelling story.  Not even a decent Grisham ending. I will check the next ones length before buying it. Waste of time",1
3.0,I “reckon” Mr. Grisham forgot sage advice from Mr. Ginsberg...,"November 6, 2018",No,"Allen Ginsberg said more than once “Kill Your Darlings.” In Parts 1 &amp; 3 Mr. Grisham keep me turning the pages into the wee hours. Vintage Grisham! After a few chapters of Part 2, I had to battle the urge to march to Part 3 immediately. Yes, I did learn some things in Part 2 that I had not known before, most notab;y about General MacAuthur. However, had I wanted to read about the Bataan Death March, I would have chosen from his suggestions for further reading in the Author’s Note. Most writers have a few “darlings” sprinkled here and there. Its a clever turn of phrase, or the echo of a great writer from the past. Unfortunately every now and then even great writers forget to kill them. Clearly Amazon reviewer after reviewer suggests that Mr. Grisham forgot to kill his darling Part 2.  P.S. I’m not a hater... I’m a longtime Grisham reader and this time a disappointed fan.",0
3.0,"Disapointing, more of a war story than a legal thriller","December 1, 2018",No,"I've read every book Grisham has written and this is my least favorite novel.  Very disappointing...The ending was pretty obvious.  The second part was too long, he could have really cut that part down, was more of a non-fiction war story than a Grisham legal thriller.  If I wanted to read what he wrote in Part 2 I would have read a non-fiction war book.",0
2.0,Train wreck!,"October 28, 2018",No,Reading this was like watching a Circus train collide with a bus load of disabled children!,2
3.0,Very compelling,"November 13, 2018",No,"I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads...A bit unusual writing style for John Grisham, this novel was sad and so compelling, and the ending twist was very unexpected and just made the whole story even sadder. But the novel is very good, especially for those who like history books and the stories from the South of the US.",0
2.0,Started great then faded quickly,"October 27, 2018",No,After about 1/2 of book it faded quickly. I had pre order due to his other books this did not live up to expectations.,3
3.0,Flimsy and unsatisfying conclusion,"November 27, 2018",No,"I am rating this book three stars because I am a fan of Grisham's and the writing did at least pull me along as I worked towards the incredible conclusion that it must be building up to. Unfortunately, it seemed to be tossed together hastily at the end, and did a very poor job of tying in the reasoning for the load of detail provided. The characters were rather uninteresting, as well. The story is sad and unsatisfying. Everything that can go wrong does. And then it's done. I truly saw no purpose for this story, except to suggest that some people just have lousy lives. I hate to be so critical, especially as a fan. Some of Grisham's earlier works I've re-read multiple times because I enjoyed the journey so much. I won't go as far as to say ""Don't read this book."" But don't expect any ""highs."" It's just ""lows,"" over and over again.",1
4.0,Great read - ending a bit of a letdown.,"November 30, 2018",No,"This book is getting a lot of hate, which I think is undeserved. I admit that I enjoy WW2 history, so the large portion of the book dedicating to events from that conflict were captivating to me...I was a bit disappointed by the ending, which I found abrupt... especially considering the length of the book and the tedious detail dedicated to the characters and events...I think some of the hate comes from the lack of a happy ending or a neat ending that ties it all together. That didn’t bother me as some stories are great without turning out the way you were hoping. This is a bit of a tragedy and definitely tells a cautionary tale.",0
1.0,A Novel of Fluff and Filler. I Do Not Recommend!,"November 23, 2018",No,"I have been a John Grisham fan reading approximately 5 of his novels, but this seems like a novel written by an author that is ""out of material"". The premise of the novel unfolds quickly, but before the ""issue"" is resolved ,350 pages later, one is subjected to a simple story and inane dialogue.  I do not recommend this novel.",2
1.0,"Definitely the WORST book he's written, and one of the TEN WORST books I've ever read","November 26, 2018",No,"I really can't imagine what possessed this otherwise decent storyteller to write this seemingly endless, pointless, boring waste of time and money. For the first 100 or so pages, I thought that eventually there might be a plot, but I foolishly kept reading hoping something interesting might happen. Wrong on both counts. A ""paycheck"" book. Avoid if at all possible!",0
1.0,False 'list' price and too expensive,"November 18, 2018",No,"Sad that Amazon feels the need to create a $30 fictitious list price to make buyers think they're getting a deal when those who choose the ebook are being fleeced for more than even the hardcover costs. Sorry Amazon - I'd love to buy it, but I'll wait and just borrow it from a friend or find a used one. Whoever made up that false 'list' price should be fired, and you should be ashamed for charging more for the electronic version than the print hardcover. That's madness. My one star rating reflects my dissatisfaction with Amazon, not the book (which I'm sure is quite good) or its author (who is probably the best legal thriller writers around).",0
5.0,Very good story.,"November 10, 2018",No,"Rooster Bar was a dud, but this story held my interest throughout. Very surprising end...Two criticisms: Joel was old enough to have to register for the draft, but the author did not mention that. And around page 99 the doctor referred to Mrs. Banning as ""Ms."" Banning. It was not the colloquial southern title, as in Mizz Banning, but a later twentieth century label. Lazy.",0
1.0,Disappointing and Long Winded,"November 2, 2018",No,"Mr Grisham is a talented writer, and I enjoy his style.  I am happy that he publicly called out the cowardice and lack of leadership by Gen McArthur.  As a career soldier, I can only say it's about time someone did.  As for this book, it is too long and too entrenched in minutia to be worth reading.  Sorry I spent the time doing so.",0
5.0,Loved It!!,"November 8, 2018",No,"I just finished this book last night and I loved it! I think this is my all-time favorite John Grisham novel...I learned a lot of history that I didn't know about also. I was never one for history but this made it interesting to learn. And I'm very glad I did...The book, even aside from the history lesson, was great. Interesting, kept me reading long into the night. All I can say is if  you like  John Grisham buy this book. It's the best one in a long time!",0
2.0,SO boring,"October 26, 2018",No,Couldn't finish too boring,2
2.0,A bad punchline,"November 19, 2018",No,"I listened to over 15 hours only to learn the 'WHY' in the last 15 minutes of the book.  You're wondering 'why' throughout the whole book, and my reaction when it was disclosed was 'oh'.  The end.  Thankfully I was able to work around the house and yard, so I won't wonder how I'll get 15 hours back.  oh.  the end.",0
1.0,Don’t waste your time or money,"November 11, 2018",No,"One of the worst books I’ve ever read, and definitely the worst Grisham book I’ve read.  Contrary to other reviewers, the only part that I did enjoy was the random middle part that describe the character’s experience in WWII.  Otherwise, there was very little plot and an uninteresting one at that.",2
5.0,Family secrets!,"November 7, 2018",No,"This is one Grisham book I found I coundn’t Put down! From the cotton plantation to the Bataan Death March in the Philippines. It’s filled with family secrets, regret, loss, murder, and historical moments! This book drew me in so much that I couldn’t put it down till I found out why Pete killed the Pastor!",0
4.0,Entertaining novel,"November 22, 2018",No,Horsham does not fail to deliver as he constructs a story about a small town where one man killed another. He went to his grave without giving the reason why. He was a hero of the war and survived the Bataan death march. He became a jungle fighter and then came home and a year later kills someone.,0
3.0,I can’t wait for his next novel.  I have not lost faith.,"November 24, 2018",No,"I love John Grisham books. There are only a couple that I really did not love.  This would be one of them. I kept waiting for some twist or punch at the end of the book. It never came.  The Ultimate villains in the book appears to be everyone, including Douglas MacArthur and the Japanese.  Too bad the sleazy lawyer did not get a reckoning of some kind.",0
1.0,Most depressing book I have ever written.,"November 7, 2018",No,"I love John Grisham.  His writing is so crisp.  His storytelling is fantastic.  His stories USUALLY make you feel better, even on tough subjects, given his  wit, morals, and integrity that position a well thought out point of view.  Then there is this book....not ONE clever/feel good moment in the book.  One see's a destruction of a family caused by a strongly principled lead character who had no right to do what he did to a another man, his wife, his kids, and everyone else who loved and respected him.....I don't get it.  By the end it was only my OCD fatal flaw that got me through the book praying for a twist that could make his family move on with some pride in their father....didn't happen.",0
5.0,A story that you cannot shake off!,"October 29, 2018",No,"Just finished The Reckoning.  This story stays with you.  I do not like flashbacks but I like Grisham’s books and I am always excited when a new one comes out, so of course I am going to read MY FAVORITE WRITER!  There is much sadness for all characters and very little happiness. I still recommend you read this book and I look forward to the movie.",0
2.0,Disappointing,"November 27, 2018",No,Wish I had read the reviews before I put this on my wishlist.  The story started out ok and held my interest somewhat.  But halfway through a long detailed account of the atrocities of WWII and specifically the Bataan Death March.  Tough to wade through especially since this was a work of fiction.  Need to take a breather from it.  Not sure I’ll finish.,0
1.0,"Like eating rice cakes in a dark closet , but more boring.","November 25, 2018",No,"Disjointed, wordy, boring, and a huge build up to...nothing. I also found it shockingly sexist. Pages and pages of war heroics then in the hospital those heros are enjoying “pretty nurses with round bottoms”. Are you kidding me? What a way to frame educated female war heros who also risked their lives. I think I’m done with JG, he’s become irrelevant and now he’s just whipping out pages to make deadlines. Not only boring but icky.",0
3.0,Boreing,"November 30, 2018",No,"The only reason I rated the book as high as a 3 is because anyone that can put so much boredom into one book deserves some recognition. It the worst audio book too which I have listened. There is no suspense in this book other than why it took the writer so long to verify what every reader should have known many chapters before all was ""made cear"".  I prurchased the book based on the writer's name. I purchased it pre release, I should have waited and read the reviews.  I will not advise anyone on what to buy but I will say I was very disappointed in how the story was told.",0
3.0,A train wreck of a novel,"November 10, 2018",No,An extraordinarily long book that didn't need to be. The author stretching things out ridiculously even though we end up where we all knew we would. A 100+ page hard left during the middle of the book was completely unnecessary. An often repetitious slog of a book.,0
1.0,The ending sucks,"November 8, 2018",No,Well written - 3 parts.Part 2 could be omitted.Part 3 doesn’t connect the dots at all.Convoluted nonsense.His worst book ever,1
5.0,Riveting fiction  from a great author,"October 28, 2018",No,A wonderful book from an accomplished storyteller.  I can not understand the poor reviews.  The characters were all well developed and completely believable.  This novel will not make you feel good when you are finished; there is no happy ending.  Just excellent fiction to make you wonder about yourself.,1
3.0,A Disappointed Grisham,"November 25, 2018",No,"A very long, disjointed tale.  Not the usual fast pace read we usually get with a Grisham novel.  I was sickened by his description of a death by electrocution as well, as the over long description of the Battan Death March.  Every character was flawed with few redeeming.qualities..  Fortunately, I purchased this book with Prime points.  You get what you pay for, I guess.",0
1.0,if you want to be sad and bored read this book!,"November 15, 2018",No,If you’ve ever wanted to feel depressed or feel like driving your car into a bridge abutment this book is for you!  Depressing story line!  Pages upon pages of stuff that isn’t needed and is just boring.  I’ve been listening on audible and after four hours I couldn’t believe how much was left.  The whole depressing middle section sucked.  You could feel better about life staring at a wall for 12 hours.  Yuck.,1
1.0,"John, what happened?","December 2, 2018",No,"I really wanted to like this book, as I have the others. I finally found myself just skipping large sections of it, hoping to get to a meaningful part. It's tedious, and pretty much a waste of time. I thought maybe there would be some saving revelation at the end. Nope. Hope the next one is better.",0
4.0,My favorite Grisham novel since The Firm,"November 4, 2018",No,I enjoyed this book tremendously. The southern humor raveled with a murder mystery is true storytelling. The Japanese march and treatment of pow’s was intense and powerfully written..The real message is ...how lies can be so damaging.,0
1.0,Sadly Not Good,"November 27, 2018",No,"Mr. Grisham used to be a pretty good writer but no longer.  Frankly ""The Reckoning"" is a total waste of time.  It meanders on to a conclusion that is obvious.  The amount of research in the Philippines is a slightly better part of the book but it is not enough.",0
5.0,Another good one from John Grissolm!,"November 17, 2018",No,"The mystery in this story lasted until the end. It had many shocking turns that left me dying to know why, what, who? Dissolves books are always fast moving. I will admit I could have done with less of the parts dealing with the war.",0
5.0,"A harrowing, must-read tale","October 31, 2018",No,"A harrowing story, both of love and betrayal and the ravages of war.  Grisham takes you on an emotional roller coaster, tugging at feelings of awe, sorrow, disgust, sadness, resignation, perseverance, and love...all doled out in abundant measure, to the point of leaving the reader conflicted about the protagonist’s actions and motives, angry that the fallout is left at his innocent children’s feet, and yet hopeful they’re youth and resilience holds them in good stead as they come to terms with their tragic past and embark on a hopeful future. Only a master story teller like Grisham can take us on such a ride.",0
5.0,Different from his other novels,"November 27, 2018",No,The format was different in this novel compared to his other books. That added to the interest but I was not pleased with the ending. The setting takes place in 1948 and I learned a lot about that Era and what was happening in Mississippi at that time.  I can think of a much more satisfying ending for this book and hope that if it is made into a movie they will change it.,0
5.0,More literature than thriller,"November 24, 2018",No,"I read this in 2 days. It is well written. The plot does meander in spots. Characters are interesting, as is the historical setting. I think a lot of this was about the effects of combat trauma on the mind of a basically decent person.",0
2.0,"A sad, tragic book","November 29, 2018",No,"I've read almost all of Grisham's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them all. I can't say this about The Reckoning. I can say I couldn't put the book down, but in the end it's a sad, tragic story of destroyed lives. I felt worse for reading it.",0
3.0,Too much historical info in the middle,"November 18, 2018",No,It was hard to get through the middle of this book. I didn't expect a historical account of the baatan death match and Japanese prisons . This could have been compressed as the basic plot was good and a twist at the end.,0
1.0,Disappointed,"November 27, 2018",No,"I was very disappointed with this book. I have always enjoyed his writing, but this one was not one of them.  The book spent too much time about the Philippine war and it really had nothing to do with why he committed the murder. I read it all to see if it would get better but it did not.",0
1.0,"Wow, this is so crappy bad","December 5, 2018",No,"I've tried over 10 times already to pick up and restart reading it, but never could past one or two pages. How come Mr. Grisham's novels became so bland and generic boring? I am not sure if I could really finish it.",0
2.0,Not the best Grisham book,"November 6, 2018",No,I have a love/hate relationship with Grisham and his writing style. His earlier titles are great! His later titles are good but then seem to end abruptly. This one isn't either. It's not even that good. It starts out to be a good story then for the last 2/3rds of the book drags on to end with a nothingness that isn't even surprising. The story could have been so much better and developed had it focused as it did in the first 1/3rd of the novel. This book successfully solidified why I will never buy another new Grisham book again.,0
4.0,Kept my Interest,"November 8, 2018",No,"I enjoyed the book as it was well written, moved right along.  Took place shortly after WW II which was a nice change which means no cell phones, internet, etc.  Definitely kept my interest going through out the book.",0
2.0,I skimmed the second part.,"November 12, 2018",No,Not my favorite John Grisham book.  I was disappointed.  I really just skimmed the 2 part because it was so graphic.  Not my style.,1
5.0,Not typical Grisham,"November 7, 2018",No,"I loved this book!!!! Mr. Grisham is one of my longtime favorite authors and although The Reckoning is a departure from most of his other offerings, it was uniquely wonderful. Other reviewers have commented negatively - perhaps because it is so different??",0
1.0,A great disappointment!,"December 3, 2018",No,"As others have already said, I was expecting a gripping legal thriller as were most of the past books by Grisham.  I have never written a book review before but was really disappointed with this one.  If I had wanted to read about the Battan Death March and POW's in WWII I would have chosen a book specifically about that.  More could have been written about Lisa and her problems and the characters and plot could have been better developed.",0
5.0,OMG!!  OMG!! what a fantastic book loved it and what a surprise at the end I did not see that coming,"November 22, 2018",No,I have read all of grisham's books and have never been disappointed and this book was great. I loved all of the history and the way the story was told. And what an ending. WOW!,1
3.0,Depressing,"November 13, 2018",No,"This is a horrible story.  The only guys who win are the bad guys. Depressing is an understatement  keep away..Having said that it is well written. So if you want to be morose and have bad dreams, forge onward.",1
2.0,Not his best,"November 1, 2018",No,This story could have been told in a couple chapters.,2
4.0,Hard to read story,"November 30, 2018",No,I’m a big Grisham fan and this is a good story but I found it to be very depressing to read. There seems to be no redemption in the story and the ending left me wanting something good to happen.,0
2.0,Not a very good novel,"November 17, 2018",No,"I almost never write a bad review - being an author myself, I feel sensitive to this. But this book was boring. Unless you want to review history, read gruesome play by play about the torture soldiers went through, have stilted characters who are one dimensional and no hope or joy in a story, don't read it. Blech.",0
3.0,So much promise...,"November 26, 2018",No,"Very disappointed!!!  Part 1 started off great, then coasted down hill. Part 2 picked up and read well but really didn’t add anything the the main plot. Part 3 which I hoped would tie things together left me with the blahs, the big reveal at the end left me feeling, well, very disappointed!!!",0
5.0,A terrible lie.,"October 30, 2018",No,"You will never guess the end of the story. I had a friend, a Louisiana legislator, who survived the Bataan Death March. It was a horrifying experience revealing the true evil in the Japanese captors. The false claims of General Douglas McArthur was surprising. The lives of this Mississippi family as so masterfully told by the author makes this his finest novel, in my opinion. I highly recommend it.",0
1.0,The Worst Gresham Novel?,"December 1, 2018",No,"This was tedious, boring, and a struggle to get through.  Perhaps his contract called for one more book to freedom.  Had this been his first book, there would not have been a second.",0
4.0,Good book,"November 27, 2018",No,Listened to on phone. I love John Grisham books. This one had his normal twists and turns but not up there with some of his better novels. It was still interesting and kept my attention.,0
2.0,Gratuitous violence,"November 15, 2018",No,"Detailed violence adds nothing to this book - I skipped almost all of one section (of 3) on the Battan Death March..Don't waste your time reaching a predictable conclusion. To get one star it would have to be poorly written too, hence 2 stars!",0
4.0,It was good because the ending was satisfying.,"November 4, 2018",No,Grisham rarely disappoints.  I didn’t give this five stars because I just couldn’t read the death march stuff.  I skimmed through it.  It’s not his fault really.  I’m sure that part was well-written as well.,0
1.0,Well written extremely depressing story,"November 26, 2018",No,"Sort of a Greek tragedy.  Well written, descriptive as you would expect from Grisham.  Totally depressing. I didn’t read it all but did jump to the end to see what happened.",0
1.0,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"November 25, 2018",No,"IF YOU LIKE TO BE ENTERTAINED BY A STORY WITH ENDLESS WOES - BE MY GUEST..THE STORY HAS NO POINT - IT IS A SAGA OF THE THE OLD SOUTH - WITH WW11 HISTORY IN THE PHILLIPINES.THOUGH HE WAS INITIALLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS, HE  GOT ON CRUSADES THAT WERE NOT INTERTAINING NOVEL FORMATE.",0
1.0,This was a Re write from some where else,"November 1, 2018",No,have read this story some where else. What a waste of money. If I wanted to re read some thing I have read befoe  I would have gone to the used book store. If this is the best you can do now maybe it is time to quit. Oh yea Name makes money. Too bad use to make a good story,1
1.0,tedious and disappointing.,"December 6, 2018",No,Don't waste your time on this one. Grisham just put too much into this one.  History of Mississippi and long - too long - history of WW2 in the Philippines.  Really had to force myself to finish this.,0
1.0,Don’t bother.,"December 3, 2018",No,"This has to be one of Grisham’s poorer efforts.  The writing is poor, from the start the story is unconvincing..One of the few books I have given away unfinished.",0
1.0,Glad I borrowed it from the library,"November 11, 2018",No,"While Grisham writing is always still amazing, it was wasted on this book.  It was a descent into depression, one step at a time.  So much so that I found myself skipping page after page as the narration changed so little from the depresive tone of the book.  I ended up reading maybe 60% overall and still came away from ending disappointed of the time I had wasted on this novel",1
5.0,Another brilliant novel,"November 21, 2018",No,Another brilliant novel by one of my favorite authors.  It will stay with me for a long time. Loved the memorable characters and reading the story as it unfolded.,0
2.0,Disappointing,"December 6, 2018",No,"Boring, boring— not a good read.  The ending was terrible.  Not sure I will be extorted to read another.  I have read all his books and this was the poorest yet.",0
1.0,Enjoyable book – terrible ending,"December 2, 2018",No,I I thoroughly enjoyed the book - was very compelling. I was concerning the ending would be bad throughout the book but kept reading anyway. The ending was even worse than I anticipated.,0
2.0,One of his worst,"December 5, 2018",No,"I was looking forward to this one. I liked the historical fiction part. I even like the setup of the parts of the story. But overall, it was a let down.",0
5.0,Not Grisham's usual,"November 23, 2018",No,Don't know why all the negative reviews.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book from slow start to surprise finish.  Not his usual legal thriller but I thought he did a great job with the story line.  Five stars from me!!,0
1.0,Not his best at all.,"November 15, 2018",No,"I used to love Grisham, but this is very  formulaic.  Every scene has been written many times before.  Read one of his older books, this is a waste of money.",1
2.0,Not Grisham at his best,"November 15, 2018",No,Weird and disturbing story sandwiches an uncharacteristic war and hero story. Very bizarre. Not particularly well written or entertaining to read.,0
2.0,it took too long,"November 9, 2018",No,"John Grisham is my favorite author! However, ""The Reckoning"" took too long to reveal the reasons behind the main character's actions. On a positive note, I will say that the book's accounting of the horrific actions taken against those forced to participate in the Bataan Death March led me to more deeply admire the men and women who sacrificed so much to protect freedom.",0
2.0,Did not finish the journey!,"November 3, 2018",No,Very disappointing by Grisham.  Long winded and chronologically confused.  I've quit one other novel out of hundreds in the last 10 years.  Good luck!,0
2.0,Boring and Bad Ending,"December 4, 2018",No,I slogged through waiting for the book to get better. Instead it just went down down down. Very disappointed. What happened to the can't put them down reads by the author?,0
1.0,By far his worst,"December 2, 2018",No,I've read everything Grisham and this is by far his worst. The plot is thin and seems to exist only so he could give us a history lesson that I had no interest in.,0
1.0,Reads like an outline.,"November 6, 2018",No,"Reads like an outline, a book report.  It never improves. No character development. A waste of time. Racial tensions and issues poorly addressed.",0
5.0,Humanity on the stage. Again.,"November 30, 2018",No,Still a Grisham reader after all the years - note: he just gets better! He focuses on the people of his favorite locale to explain the how and the why. We really understand.,0
1.0,"If you are depressed before you read it, you will be after.","November 12, 2018",No,"I have read every John Grisham novel so I was looking forward to another legal thriller. Unfortunately, this book was an endless collection of tragic events that left one family totally destroyed. I was very disappointed and don’t believe I will read another Grisham book.",2
2.0,Kind of a dud,"November 3, 2018",No,"While I love John Grisham and appreciated learning more about the Bataan Death March, the ending was incomplete and a disappointment. Too bad.",0
4.0,peoples' words effect life,"November 18, 2018",No,"held our interest throughout. unusual grisham in that it has us thinking about issues such as war, truth, relationships, law,.death penalty, people's word",0
3.0,"Page turner, but typical disappointing ending","December 5, 2018",No,"This is really a short story, stretched into novel length.  The middle portion is inserted and feels unnecessary.  The conclusion, typical of most recent (last 10+ novels) Grisham, is disappointing.",0
2.0,Grisham's poorest,"November 20, 2018",No,"A mishmash of repeated southern small towns and cotton farms stories , with a repetitive Bataan March, concentration camp  and Phillippine  guerrila period, all well known and irrelevant to th main plot. Doesn't even seen m to br e Grisham!",0
2.0,Not that good,"November 17, 2018",No,"The first part was good. He set up the mystery and had me hungry for more.  Then he dropped back in time and spent half the book reliving the war on the Philipines.  It was gory  and had nothing to do with the mystery.  Part 3 promised the resolution of the mystery, but it did not come until the final pages.  The ending was surprising but it was also anticlimatic.",0
2.0,Disappointing.,"November 25, 2018",No,Not what I wanted like other reviews the middle of this book is a World War 2 history lesson maybe interesting but not what I wanted skipped much of book to get to the end fortunately I didn't buy the book.,0
1.0,Great If You Want to be Depressed,"November 28, 2018",No,Just a pile of crap.  So depressing I couldn't wait for it to be over and then it was and I wished I had the time back!,0
5.0,Fantastic Read,"November 29, 2018",No,"I couldn't put down this book until I read it to the end. Brilliantly written, interesting historical facts and a great plot.",0
5.0,A real page-turner!,"November 12, 2018",No,I consider this book as fantastic historical fiction. The military part was very enlightening and the fictional Southern family side was terrific.,0
5.0,Suspenseful .,"November 25, 2018",No,A typical gripping book by John Grisham .Reckoning revealed some interesting history about the WW I I fight in the Pacific.,0
4.0,Great Read,"November 9, 2018",No,"I throughly enjoyed this book. While most reviewers hated part two it was my favorite part of the book. The ending, while tragic didn’t cheat the reader. . His narrative about the Bataan Death March and Pete’s survival was riveting and informative.  Sure this isn’t his typical legal thriller but it also shows that he’s not a one trick pony",0
1.0,Depressing,"November 21, 2018",No,"Kept reading expecting something good to happen, it didn’t...Should have been a short story, spun out way too long for an ending with no satisfaction.",0
5.0,Lots of WW11 history!,"November 7, 2018",No,"Excellent read! Loved reading the history!.No filthy language, no smut. I recommend this book!",0
3.0,Reading,"December 1, 2018",No,Good story very interesting a little bit wordy for me didn’t resolve until the last three pages,0
3.0,Hmmmmm,"December 2, 2018",No,3.5 stars. Maybe 4 stars. I am not really sure yet how I feel about this. I just finished and I am not happy with the story but can not decide why.,0
4.0,A Good Borrowed Story,"November 27, 2018",No,This was a story within a story. A war story blended with a murder wrapped up in a family saga.,0
2.0,The Reckoning Needed to Go on a Diet,"November 20, 2018",No,"I’m not going to write a long, detailed, boring review. (This book did enough of that.) The novel  started off fine, and Part Two was interesting although too long and too detailed. Part Three ,however, was where this book met its demise. I found myself tediously skimming page after page, and the unveiling, already obvious, left the reader feeling shortchanged and disappointed. .",0
2.0,Did not meet expectations.,"November 15, 2018",No,Very disappointed by this book. Grisham is losing his touch. Part I was tedious to read. Part II was unnecessary filler.,0
1.0,Bored to tears,"November 26, 2018",No,Absolutely pointless read. Half of the book was a history lesson. Exhausting and repetitive detail that led me to believe it was to get the page count up. Shallow characters that I couldn’t muster the strength to feel any kind of empathy for or with whom I could identify. I think Grisham may possibly be receiving writing advice from Danielle Steele. Awful.,0
2.0,Disappointing,"November 6, 2018",No,I am a big Grisham fan but this book was a disappointment. When I finished the book I was sorry that I had invested the time read ing it.,0
1.0,Big fat Dud,"November 23, 2018",No,"I am a fan of the author. I should say ,I was a fan of the author. The book was a giant waist of time. The author says that he has to get the OK from his wife on the plot before writing the new book. What was she thinking?",1
1.0,Not good at all,"November 21, 2018",No,"I've bought and liked many books by Grisham, but I sure wish I had not bought this one.",1
1.0,Grisham’s first Egg,"November 22, 2018",No,"First I won’t to acknowledge John Grisham as an outstanding story teller and my favorite author! I look forward to each new release and purchase as soon as possible. After finishing “The Reckoning” I found myself: left wanting, confused, disappointed. There is really nothing I can positive about this book. The only reason for the 1-star is there is no choice for 0. A true EGG...",1
3.0,A very different book from John Grisham,"November 5, 2018",No,This is not his typical lawyer book...it  is a story of war and a story of prison camps ..very graphic..just a disappointment for me.,0
1.0,Truly disappointing,"November 8, 2018",No,The gradual decline in quality has been disappointing from a reliable favorite. The world and reality disappointing enough without paying good money for a read that will leave you disheartened.  No hope from The Rainmaker or moral pleasure of A Time to Kill. Perhaps writing reflects the times.,0
3.0,Disappointing,"November 24, 2018",No,"This plot pulled me in from the beginning, but then it was a long wait to a disappointing and depressing ending. Almost seems sadistic for an author to do this to his faithful readers.",0
1.0,Very disappointing,"November 25, 2018",No,"I have  liked most of Grisham's novels so far, but this one was a disappointment. The lack of imagination and the requirement to come up with a substantial number of pages left a big hole in the middle of the novel which was unfortunately filled in the most artificial manner by a boring episode of WW2 in the Philippines. Grisham has lost his creativity. Sad!",0
2.0,"Extremely Disappointing - Predictable, Boring","November 23, 2018",No,"If you are looking for a history lesson on WW2 in the Philippines, you'll love it. Otherwise, it is simply a long, drawn out, simplistic and predictable story that could have been told in 10 pages. No twists, no turns, no surprises. Just a depressing ending with no redemption.",0
1.0,The Reckoning,"November 6, 2018",No,i usually enjoys his books but this was tedious in parts. i want a legal thriller from him and most of it was a history lesson.  Not his best may be all good things come to end and these book is an example.,1
4.0,Three books in one,"November 21, 2018",No,I believe that persons who object to the value of this book are from the 2 generations removed from the Bataan Death March &amp; the inhumanity of the Japanese military &amp; the brutality of World War 2.  There are 3 books within this one.  Each has its value.  There is an experience to be learned in this book &amp; John Grisham tells it well.,0
1.0,The surprise is there is no surprise,"December 6, 2018",No,Over 500 pages on my tablet just for a Democrat to call me a racist? If I wanted that I would just turn on CNN.,0
5.0,One of Grisham's best,"November 17, 2018",No,This is one of his very best.  Completely intriguing story told in an intriguing way.,0
5.0,"A well constructed, riveting tragedy","November 6, 2018",No,"I have read all of Grisham's books and loved most.  Yes, this one is different, but different in an refreshing way.  Some fellow Audible reviewers wanted a repeat of the same legal drama formula and were disappointed.  However, others have delighted in Grisham's creation of a historical fiction mystery.  Read it, enjoy it and be surprised when all is revealed.",0
5.0,A very good story,"November 7, 2018",No,This is a fine book with a wealth of historical information that may be old to some readers but highly educational to many more young people who enjoy John Grisham’s writing style. I commend the author for not getting stuck in a rut and rewriting the same narrative in every book. This is an interesting story for those who are interested in reading an interesting book.,0
2.0,One of the weakest Grisham books,"November 4, 2018",No,I didn't think the story had a good flow. Seemed like the intent was only to keep you guessing about the reason for the murder and not build a story around it.,0
1.0,Convoluted Mess,"November 22, 2018",No,"What a major disappointment. Starts off strong and meanders for hundreds of pages. Incredibly boring.  Save yourself the trouble, read the first 50 pages and the last 5.",1
1.0,Glad I didn't spend any $$,"December 6, 2018",No,"I read this book via the Libby library app and so glad I didn't spend any money buying it.  Skipped over the entire second part of the book as it was much too graphic for me as was the end of the first part.  The whole book gave me a giant ""ick"" factor.",0
5.0,Truth at very end,"November 18, 2018",No,A surprise ending.  Never guessed. Great historical facts. Makes you angry sad and disappointed in mankind. Will we never learn?  Great story.,0
4.0,Not Typical Grisham,"December 6, 2018",No,"Not a typical lawyer book, but it keeps you in suspense.",0
5.0,Another good read from Grisham,"November 12, 2018",No,"This book is less about legal shanagans and more about human relationships and truths, lies and their consequences. It keeps you guessing and turning pages right up to the end. A sad, but intriguing tale.",0
2.0,The most depressing book I've ever read!,"November 2, 2018",No,Nothing good happened to anyone. I kept hoping it would change. The lucky people in the book were those who died. This makes The Story of Ann Frank &amp; To Kill a Mockingbird seem like a picnic.,0
2.0,Disappointing - Moved WAY too slow,"November 19, 2018",No,"This was a disappointing read from one of my favorite authors.  The story moved incredibly slow; poor character development; and the secret, when revealed, was a let down.",1
2.0,Not a Nice Story,"November 11, 2018",No,"It’s an interesting story, but dark and depressing.  There’s no way I would ever read it again or recommend it to a friend.",0
1.0,A huge disappointment,"November 29, 2018",No,"I liked the opening. I found the middle third about Pete's war experiences in the Philippines interesting to the military history buff in me, but irrelevant to the thrust of the story. The end was a disappointment. Grisham's books have been going downhill.",0
1.0,Waste of time,"November 9, 2018",No,This book is not worth reading. I have read most of John Grisham’s books and even wondered if someone else had written the book for him. I read the author’s explanation of the origin of the story. Knowing where he got his ideas did not make it any better. Don’t waste your time.,0
1.0,Read The Reviews,"November 27, 2018",No,"This is not only Grisham's worst book, it's one of the worst books by anyone I've ever read. He owes his followers an apology.",0
3.0,Disappointed,"November 25, 2018",No,Very disjointed book and not one of his best.,0
2.0,First time I did not finish a Grisham book,"November 14, 2018",No,"For the first time ever I did not finish a book by Grisham. Somehow the story never connected with me, the characters never developed in a way I could feel with or for them and even though the narrative of Guerilla war in the Philipines was interesting, I stoped reading at the beginning of part three.",0
5.0,Grisham's Close Second,"November 11, 2018",No,"A Time to Kill is John Grisham's best novel, with The Reckoning coming in a close second (and I have read all of his books.)  I was enthralled from the beginning until the end of this book, with tears shed is several parts.  I did not want this book to end.  Keep up the good writing!",0
5.0,I would have never thought,"November 3, 2018",No,A military man who served the In WWII is executed for murderIng a Pastor.  Why did he do it?  You will be surprised.,0
2.0,pretty boring,"November 24, 2018",No,"I kept waiting for something to happen but the story just drags on and on. I only finished it because it was written by John Grishom.  If his next one is this slow moving, I won't bother.",0
1.0,Too slow,"December 2, 2018",No,"This book was so hard to get into, which is surprising for John Grisham.  It just dragged on and on with no point..I returned it about 1/2 way through.",0
1.0,Keep it in the South,"December 2, 2018",No,So disappointed.  Why make WW1 such a big part of the book.  I felt cheated because I have read many books about the cruelty of the Japanese but did not expect this in his book taking place in the South.,0
2.0,It dragged on and on and on and on. I kept hoping for a really great climax,"November 1, 2018",No,I generally like Grisham’s books. This one was well written but it dragged on and on and on and on. I kept hoping for a really great climax at the end and was greatly disappointed.,0
3.0,Where's the plot?,"November 7, 2018",No,John worst.,0
5.0,Good legal thriller,"November 12, 2018",No,"Loved the story, like any Grisham book. However was kinda weird, story broken into three parts. Kinda disheartening that the author brings his personal political beliefs into his stories. Has done this on a number of occasions",0
3.0,"kind of ""wordy""","November 17, 2018",No,Not one of my favorites.  Went over the same details too much.,0
5.0,True to John Grisham’s style,"November 19, 2018",No,"This was different from John Grisham’s other books, but still grabbed me from the beginning. And a surprise ending—I thought I knew the ending but was still surprised. Definitely a good read!",0
1.0,Waste of time,"November 15, 2018",No,Don’t waste your time on this book.  If you want to know about Japanese POW camps read Unbroken.  Where is the real John Grisham?,0
2.0,Like a sleeping pill!,"November 30, 2018",No,I waited until the last two pages to find the point and it was an overwhelming disappointment.  The book dragged on with pointless detail that left me frustrated.  Never a catch to keep you reading.  Grisham needs to up his game.,0
5.0,You don’t know the truth until the end,"November 30, 2018",No,Typical John Grisham. On pins and needles to the end. Baffled by the secret,0
1.0,Did not keep your intetest,"December 1, 2018",No,"I bought this for my mother for her birthday, although she loves reading all his books John Gresham, she said that was the worst. So sorry. She is an avid reader, to each their own.",0
5.0,Grisham great as usual,"December 4, 2018",No,"A little different from your usual Grisham novel, but even better. A premeditated murder and he won’t tell why until the end. Lots of twists",0
5.0,??,"November 27, 2018",No,Great novel,0
2.0,So Disappointed!,"November 27, 2018",No,"I kept waiting for the good guys to win, the characters Grisham so meticulously painted as larger than life!.  Instead it  just turned out to be a sad story with pitiful characters.  I enjoyed the WWI history and setting.",0
1.0,worst Grisham book I have read,"December 4, 2018",No,There was nothing good about the book. If I wanted to read history I would have gotten a history book. The end did not justify slogging through the first three quarters of the book. I bought it based on other Grisham books I have liked.,0
1.0,Disappointed,"November 20, 2018",No,I love his books but this was a disappointment.,1
5.0,Best Grisham book yet,"December 1, 2018",No,Absolutely riveting tale from beginning to end .  It's been a long time since I read a book I couldn't put down!  I highly recommend it!..,0
3.0,"Definitely not a Grisham  ""thriller""","November 19, 2018",No,"This was a good story, but not up to his usual standard.  Maybe it was just me since I do not like war stories, although this was done the best it could be. It did have a surprise ending, but seemed unfinished.",0
1.0,don't waste you time,"November 11, 2018",No,"I miss the days when a Grisham novel was spellbinding.  Although the Bataan death march bit is interesting, this was a pretty boring book with a useless plot.",1
2.0,Depressing,"November 18, 2018",No,Morbid. Depressing. I wish I hadn’t read the book. I gave it two stars only because it is well written morbidity.,0
1.0,What a depressing book..,"November 21, 2018",No,"I kept waiting for the turn around in this book. For something redeeming.  But there is nothing.  If you want to see the results of hidden sin, read this.",0

5.0,The truth about war.,"November 13, 2018",No,"Great historical fiction.  I hate listening to any book twice, but this is the rare exception. It’s A - plus.",0
2.0,A real downer,"November 13, 2018",No,This was a lose lose situation for all characters involved. Good historical background on WW2 but no redemptive theme whatsoever.,0
1.0,Such a letdown,"November 25, 2018",No,Such a disappointment!  Was looking forward to a period legal thriller and kept waiting to get to the “secret”. What a let down!  Where is the Grisham we all knew and loved?!,0
1.0,No more Grishams for me,"November 6, 2018",No,Can’t believe I wasted my time! I should have stopped when I started skimming over about 1/3 into the book.,0

2.0,Not up to usual standards,"November 9, 2018",No,Kind of a rambling story with a lackluster plot.,0
2.0,NOT HIS BEST,"November 10, 2018",No,Very slow.  417 pages as if the writer was paid by the word or page!  Cannot recommend this effort by Mr. Grisham.,0
5.0,Difficult to put it down,"November 23, 2018",No,The worst part of reading this book like many of Grisham books it when you read the last page. Now I have to wait for the next one.,0
2.0,Could not wait to finish,"November 17, 2018",No,lots and lots of wasted words going around in circles. I was waiting for the story to get interesting. Never did.,0

5.0,Excellent and Intriguing,"November 16, 2018",No,Story moves along like classic Grisham,0
5.0,Outstanding,"December 2, 2018",No,Amazing book!  John Grisham has outdone himself. Was disappointed when it ended as I wanted more,0

5.0,Ford County Grisham is the best Grisham,"November 25, 2018",No,Nice read,0
4.0,Prompt delivery of this book,"October 24, 2018",No,"I was afraid it wasnt delivered, but with a different driver(?) we found the book. Thank you and I know we  will enjoy readng this book.",1
5.0,A thoroughly gripping story,"November 1, 2018",Yes,"I give this book a five star rating for a number of reasons.1 - It's not like so many other novels that pick up the theme of a Greek tragedy where problems just keep mounting then a God swoops in and saves the day. Only now the God is a computer geek..2 - It's a real story, not three short stories woven together so it takes up 300 to 400 pages..3 - You really feel as if you know the characters and care about them..4 - I had a cousin who was in the Bataan death March and wound up in Japan. He also never talked about the experience and this book she'd some light on what he went through..I totally enjoyed the book. John Grisham always keeps me guessing. Keep  'em coming.",6
4.0,I loved the history and also loved the book,"November 16, 2018",Yes,"I'm surprised to read so many negative reviews of The Reckoning.  It didn't put me to sleep, but did just the opposite.  I was up late savoring this book and anxiously waiting for the secrets of this 1940s landowner's character to be revealed.  As a history lover, I thoroughly enjoyed the WWII information, especially the information about the war in the Philippines and the Bataan Death March.  My father was stationed in the Philippines during WWII, so it was of particular interest to me...I think that the historical parts of the book went a long way in defining the character of Pete Banning.  In each phase of his military career he developed more of a sense of justice that ultimately lead to his grievous actions.  His definition of justice was off, as was the condition of his wife when he returned home.  There are characters that I don't particularly like in the book, but they were written to be not not very likeable people...The Reckoning is a sad, dark story that ends even darker, but nothing is carved in stone that says a book has to have a happy ending.  It also made me wonder what my father may have experienced that he never revealed...I've read all of John Grisham's books, and there are a few that I thought weren't as good as this one.  It is also interesting to read where this story and plot originated.  Having read this close to Veteran's Day, it also made me think about what the veterans of all wars suffer through, both those who return home like Pete and those who don't.  The history was important, in my opinion, because we owe it to those for whom it was real and we owe ourselves to learn.  I have always thought that John Grisham's books show his strong sense of social conscience.",1
5.0,The Reckoning,"October 23, 2018",Yes,Very interesting and entertaining storyline full of factual information about the Philippians during WWII . The first part of the novel is about a murder and the war storyline is given as background  about one of the fascinating characters in this book. John Gresham never disappoints and his in depth research provides factual information about whatever the storyline may be.,3
5.0,Grisham never disappoints,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"Wonderful exploration of a strong character who might be too strong for his own good--Pete Banning is a cotton farmer who walks into the office of the Methodist preacher and shoots him dead. This happens in the first chapter, and we spend the rest of the book learning why he did it--with a twist to the secret that started the downhill slide of the whole Banning family. If only Pete had listened to the preacher, a whole lot of trouble could have been avoided for just about everyone in the book..In his usual clear-eyed way, Grisham creates characters that you know he's lifted from real people he's observed throughout his life. Pete Banning is a hard man who is so black and white, he probably doesn't know any other colors exist. He loves his wife with a passion hardened by the horror he sees as a captive during WWII, where he was an unwilling participant of the Bataan Death march...Seeing death that came with greater regularity than any meal--Pete holds on tight to what he loves, until it's all he can cling to when he comes as close to death as you can come without going through the tunnel. Maybe something cracked in his mind, removing any color from his life, leaving only a black and white world of good versus evil. Pete can no longer tolerate the woman he loved as being anything but the perfect image he used to keep himself alive.. Of course no one can live up to that kind of worship, and Liza is no exception. When she gets the news that Pete is dead, she resigns herself to a life without him.  When finally comes home alive, Liza had to readjust herself to her husband--home but deeply broken and hardened in a way she can't understand..War was the real villain in this story--though Grisham never states this fact--it's what I came away with. Brilliant story from a writer who will go down as one of the greats--to be studied by later generations in a way we can't appreciate now because to us, he's just a bestselling author.",0
5.0,One of Grisham's Very Best Works. A Great Read!,"November 7, 2018",Yes,"This is quite a read.  400+ pages of an at-once straight-forward and deeply complex novel told backwards - The first part about the 'here and now', and the second part about before the now. Neither part could stand alone as a novel - but together they meld into a wonderfully engaging and tense narrative about a seemingly unexplained deliberate murder of a clergyman by a town's most stalwart and respected citizen...Details abound - none without deliberate purpose ...  For example, the 'Death March' on the Bataan peninsula during the early days of WWII plays prominently in the second portion of the book and is told in graphic and deeply disturbing detail...The 'reveal' does not come until the final pages - and is worth reading over 400 pages to get to it. At least, I really thought so! Definitely not the more usual Grisham formula courtroom drama - but something much richer and provocative. This is a truly great read.",0
4.0,When bad things happen to good folks.,"October 26, 2018",Yes,"Not at all what I expected but that's okay. WWII and after, two stories, of the same family that converge into one, and it doesn't end well. Doesn't seem like a Grisham story except for the beginning and end. The middle is a bit of a chore, but still a good yarn. Jay Fitzpatrick Author of ""The Patsy""",1
5.0,Easy read with three sections to learn why and how things happened.,"November 27, 2018",Yes,Twists and turns along the way.  Book written in three parts. After you are hooked in the first part you find out the whys and how’s.,0
4.0,A good read!,"November 20, 2018",Yes,"The Reckoning is an interesting and good read. A little too much focus on war for me, but an enjoyable read.",0
5.0,Great Read,"November 25, 2018",Yes,I love his books and always buy them.,0
3.0,Too confusing,"October 30, 2018",Yes,Too confusing,0
5.0,THX,"November 17, 2018",Yes,THX,0
5.0,Great,"December 1, 2018",Yes,Great,0
5.0,Death of a Hero,"October 23, 2018",No,"It says so on the book's flap as well as on any description written about it.  The novel opens with Pete Banning going over to the Methodist Church he and his family attended and shooting and killing his friend the Reverend Dexter Bell.  We immediately know what happened and basically what Mr Grisham's novel revolves around.  The why becomes a fascinating study in human relations and what factors can cause one man to kill another.  The book is centered in a small town in the state of Mississippi just shortly after the end of World War II.  Pete Banning has returned home a decorated hero, wanting only to resume his life with his beautiful wife and two children.  His heroism is important enough to the story for Mr Grisham to detail the facts behind his bravery.  A well researched look at the events unfolding in the Philippines at the time of the Bataan death march.  A portrait of the horrid conditions in the internment camp in which Pete is held coupled with his heroic actions later in fighting the Japanese upon his escape is extremely well done.  His character is molded by this phase of his life and may supply clues to his motivation in committing murder...  Pete's children, his wife and his sister are effected by his actions.  They are completely surprised at his lack of interest in defending himself at the trial convened to try him for murder.  He is sentenced to death via the relatively new method of the electric chair and makes no effort to  pursue the appeals vehemently in order to possibly change it to life in prison. The execution takes place in the same courtroom as his trial did and it's horror too well described...  The novel is John Grisham at his peak exercising a literary talent second to none.  When is the next book coming out is the only question remaining for the reader and I second that opinion.",21
5.0,Excellent as always,"October 30, 2018",Yes,"Enjoyed, enjoyed, enjoyed!!!! Outstanding as always. The war parts were amazing but terrifying at the same time. What detail he writes.",0
5.0,HAVE PLENTY OF TIME BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT BEABLE TO PUT IT DOWN !!,"November 6, 2018",Yes,THE BOOK WAS GREAT !!,0
5.0,Great book!,"October 27, 2018",Yes,Love John Grisham!,0
2.0,Too long to reach a very unsatisfying ending.,"October 29, 2018",No,"Normally Grisham can tell a tale which is rich in detail and holds your attention. However this book was just boring in spots. The historical detail on WWII was interesting but really had nothing to do with the story. The ending is almost nonsensical. I don't think people would act like that. Way too long while getting to the ""secret""",2
1.0,"Boring, worthless plot","December 6, 2018",No,"Did this book have any redeeming features?  Actually, yes.  It contained, in the middle, a very realistic description of the Bataan Death March.  The only reason to read this book is to remind folks how brutally our captured soldiers were treated by the Japanese, something that the pampered youth of today cannot possibly understand.  Beyond that, the story in a nutshell.  A war hero shoots another man, a minister in town.  He had been declared ""presumed dead"" during  the war for several years.  His wife was being comforted by the minister, a known womanizer.  It was obvious that he shot the man for having an affair with his wife during the time he had been declared dead.  At the end of the extremely long boring novel, (spoiler alert for those who want to actually read this turkey) it is discovered that he shot the wrong man.  Ooops!  As I said, except for the description of the Bataan Death March, this book was a waste of time.",0
1.0,My last Grisham read.,"November 22, 2018",No,"It’s almost as if he has forgotten how to end a book.  The last few I have read, the build up is old Grisham, then it’s as if his ideas stagnate and he just ends the narrative.  So disappointing, the storyline has such potential.  So many different avenues, and outcomes possible.  Thanks for the great books of the past.",0
5.0,Great Story!,"November 16, 2018",No,Grisham books are so entertaining. This one is no exception. It’s a great read.,0
4.0,Talk about a surprise but sad ending.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,I have a personal dislike of the way this story kept backing up to the past.  I know it explained why people acted the way they did.  I really didn't like the ending.  Guess I always like the ending to make sense.  Not always a happy ending but one that makes the rest of the book make sense.  I felt like I wasted my time reading and investing my time.,0
2.0,Second part was boring and tedious.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,I did not enjoy the second part where descriptions of war were endless.  I skipped over the majority.,0
4.0,A good read,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"Thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  A well-told story of a family having to deal with an unsolved mystery of violence.  Thankfully the conclusion brings understanding, even if unfulfilling to the characters.",0

5.0,Great!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Great!,0
1.0,Not a good read,"December 10, 2018",No,"Did not enjoy this book. Reading it was laborious. So much of the book was in setting up this huge drama that he then resolves in about one page. It was kind a horrible, honestly.",0
5.0,Another good Grisham book,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"Really good story. The book starts at the end, sort of, and then flashes back to the details. Good format kept me reading. 👍",0
5.0,The Sacrifice Made During WWII.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"I have personally been to Philippines and visited the route of Bataan Death March; the history provided in thus book was sobering and made me appreciate even more our WWII  heritage and soldiers,",1
1.0,"No redeeming return on time invested ...A sad &amp; negative story that describes true ,but hopeless events...not what I expect from Grisham","December 10, 2018",Yes,I do not recommend this book for followers of Grisham who  expect a positive twist on a tough subject matter.... it was a downer for me— wish there had been a preview or warning that it was going to be ultimately depressing.,0
3.0,Graphic war torture descriptions.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,This was a conflation of at least 2.novels. The history of the Bataan.death march&amp; the killing of the.wrong man due to miscegenation. They do not mix in the right proportions.,0
5.0,Wait for the Finish!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Another excellent novel by one of our generation's leading author. I enjoyed the transposition of events and character development as always.,0
5.0,Grisham continues to be a great author!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Couldn't put my kindle down.,0
5.0,Another well done story by Grissom,"December 10, 2018",Yes,i particularly enjoy his first hand Southern accounts of the deep south segregation issues..the middle of this work is fascinating concerning the Philippines and the atrocities inflicted by the Japanese..Excellent book enjoy the read!,0
5.0,Another interesting read.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"Mr. Grisham does it again. This is another of his great reads. This book is very interesting but beware, there is not happy moment in the entire book. I suspose some people lead lives like that.",0
4.0,A few surprises in store,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"It was disturbing and depressing on many levels. There were some unresolved issues that maybe could’ve been, but not every book has to have a happy ending.",0
5.0,Great historical account of the second world war battle for the Philippines.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Didn't love the ending.  Really felt it was like two different novels put together.,0
5.0,A page turner,"December 10, 2018",Yes,I've read almost all of his books.  And I have nearly all of them.  I buy them as soon as I find out a new one is available. His book are ALWAYS good.  And one thing I like about them is because They are CLEAN.  He knows how to tell a story without using foul language or vulgar descriptions.  Writers who do that in my opinion do not have a very big vocabulary..And should try another profession.,0
4.0,This was totally different than Grisham's usual courtroom drama!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"I enjoyed the story a lot, but would have liked the ending to be fleshed out a little more.  It sort of ended abruptly.",0
5.0,Hold on for the Reckoning.,"December 10, 2018",No,Do not get disappointed in the first part of the book. It really brings you into the story.,0
5.0,REVENGE WITHOUT REGRET,"December 10, 2018",Yes,MEETS THE HIGH STANDARDS OF GRISSOM NOVELS,0
1.0,Refund Please,"December 10, 2018",No,"Terrible. Simply terrible. This effort is more evidence that the celebrated author is living off his past laurels. He comments that the story is based on a tale he heard while serving as a State Representative in Mississippi. This reads like he simply pulled his notes of that conversation out and pasted them together to meet a publisher's deadline. What a waste of time, and the cost of the novel. Can't get the time back but at least refund the money.",0
2.0,Good writer but sad story!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Sad!,0
5.0,Keep Reading,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Love John Grisham novels - this one did not disappoint...,0
5.0,It wasn't who you think!!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"It was a gift to me from me!! As usual John Grisham did not fail to make this story very-very amazing. I love all his books, and I  have a collection of all  his books..Lollie",0
4.0,Well written awful story,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"This is a well-written awful story.  Tragic story which touches lives of every single character.  One man's act of love and revenge takes its toll.  But Grishim keeps you into it.  Surprise ending makes the entire story worth reading.  But it remains an awful story that you stick with it to find out why the character did what he did, knowing all along he made the wrong choice.",0
2.0,Mixed emotions,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"I almost put this book down a few times but then kept reading. The sequence of events of the 3 different sections was disjointing. The event in the court house was too much. The first part just moved slowly. Parts of the book were excellent - descriptions living in the south during the WWII period, the Philippines during WWII, etc. Sorry but not up to John Grishman standards.",0
5.0,Five Stars,"December 10, 2018",No,Loved this book very unexpected ending,0
4.0,Too much cotton pickin!!!,"December 10, 2018",No,I did not feel that this was one of John Grisham's better books. I got so tired of hearing about the cotton fields.  It did keep you interested to find out why he committed murder. I hope his next book will not haveso much about cotton or baeball.,0
4.0,Stunning,"December 10, 2018",No,"Many people are posting very negative reviews of this book, and they are entitled to their opinion, of course.  I found it gripping as soon as I started reading...This is not an action thriller, so I understand that if a person bought it thinking it was, they would be disappointed.  That does not make this a bad book.  I actually think it's a lot like many of Grisham's books.  He is excellent at conveying a sense of what a slice of a particular society is like, the assumptions people make, and the way these thing affect how events play out for good or ill.  His books make me think...I learned a lot from this book.  We get a look of what things were like in the Jim Crow South (Grisham is from that part of the country and I believe he is masterful at rendering it with all its graces and obscenities).  Since I have a background in law and am married to a lawyer, I appreciate the ins and outs of the legal maneuvering and find it adds a great deal to the story...I actually do empathize with some readers' impatience with the middle section, but for me it was not because it was boring; I did not find it so.  In fact I found it gripping in that though I had had heard some general things about the events his character is living through, I had no idea of the reason for it, the extent of it, or the general place in the war it occupied.  So although I was glad to be learning new things (horrible as they were), the previous section had set up such a strong desire to get to the bottom of the events it related that this part, as good as it was and as necessary in retrospect, did frustrate me some...The third section quickly brought us back to the mystery at the center of the story, and when at very near the end we finally get the truth, it was shocking to me and also caused me to view the entire previous parts of the book in a new light.  I sat and went over it all in my mind with my mouth open.  My heart broke, not just for his main character but for all of us...I think this is a thoughtful, gripping and in its way a beautiful book, a book about humans.  It's not a potboiler or a thriller, so don't expect it to be and you won't be disappointed.",0
4.0,Love his writing,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"I was compelled through most of this book. I got bogged down in the center during the war section of the book. It was a bit too long for me. If he would have edited the war section out it would have been a much better book because I don't really care for war stories. Hence, the 4 stars.",0
3.0,Not Grisham’s best work,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"Not grisham’s Best novel. It was somewhat engaging, but I was able to figure out the big surprise ending. Wish I had waited to borrow it from the library.",0
5.0,The ending,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Great book !!,0
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"This should disqualify Grisham as a writer, his most recent books were bad, this one should come with a money back guarantee, &amp; compensation for the readers time.",0
2.0,Needed severe editing,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"Unlike Grisham’s other novels, this story moved painfully slowly. The main protagonist had an engaging story but the work around to motive was laborious and repetitive.",0
3.0,Not his best work,"December 10, 2018",Yes,John Grisham has written many good books but this was not one of them..Wasn't bad but he can do better and has.,0
2.0,Not his best work.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"I am a John Grisham fan and look forward to the release of his novels.  Sorry to say, this one was disappointing.  I found the beginning and end of the book dragged on and on, while the middle part of the story focused on some WW II history which I found interesting.  All in all, I think Mr. Grisham can and should do better next time.",0
5.0,"Tragic , sad and awesome!!!","December 10, 2018",Yes,The reviews of those who thought it was just ok or not his best work must have read a different book.I really enjoyed it from start to finish.,0
2.0,This wasn't as good as I hoped.,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"I've enjoyed Grisham's other novels, but it wasn't too long before I started skipping a lot of center content because the story went from present events to the past, which bogged down and confused the story line. It would have made more sense to start the story in the past and work its way to the beginning, which culminated in the outcome. but then I'm not the writer.",0
5.0,"Action, gripping.","December 10, 2018",Yes,Excellent writing of his pow time.,0
1.0,Boring,"December 10, 2018",Yes,My least favorite Grisham book.  Very disappointed.,0
1.0,Worst Grisham book ever!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Terrible!,0
5.0,Not just another legal thriller!!!!  So much more!!!,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Always impressive.  A different type of novel but still entertaining!,0
3.0,Not Recommended,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"Lots of historical information about WW II in the Pacific  -- Bataan Death March..Story builds well, but really weak ending made it disappointing.",0
5.0,Good read,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Captivating,0
3.0,Grisham fan but...,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"... not my favorite. The Firm, The Partner and The Brethren are still at the top of my list. The ending was a let-down for me.",0
5.0,Good reading,"December 10, 2018",Yes,I liked this book that I'm reading.I would read the book if you like reading John Grisham Books.,0
4.0,Barbara Lee Klein,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"JG  only writes  excellent books. However, some I like more  than others.  I think I've read all of his books starting with books on tape I played while I was driving.",0
1.0,Awful,"December 10, 2018",Yes,I asked for and received a refund.  This book began as a powerhouse and a wonderful weekend read. Never again will I pay that much $ and think I will receive value just because it is a major author.,0
5.0,Another great Grisham book,"December 10, 2018",Yes,Another great book by John Grisham. I have read every book he has written.,0
1.0,regret buying,"December 10, 2018",Yes,"Totaly not worthwhile boring! ""I want my money back""!!! Will certainly never buy any of his books again!!!!",0
3.0,Kind of depresing,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"He is a good author. I was able to get lost in the story, but the whole thing just made me sad, and angry. Such a depressing read all the way thru the end",0
1.0,Hated it.,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Gresham has hit bottom. This is all I need on these times of humiliation about our thuggish government.I do not need to read about the Bataan death March nor wade through misery for no clever defeat of the venal villains.,0
1.0,Waste of time,"December 9, 2018",Yes,One of the worst novels I’ve read. Three books in one and the secret is finally revealed on the last page. I would have put the book down about two pages into the second section but had to know if I was right (not hard to guess). Very disappointing noting Grisham novel. Don’t waste your time.,0
5.0,Have read them a.l.,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Good but not the best,0
5.0,Doesn’t disappoint,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Excellent book.  Grisham doesn’t disappoint.  He stays true to his style and weaves a stunning story.  Thank you.  I couldn’t put the book down.,0
4.0,Gripping,"December 9, 2018",No,Gripping and well written to create intensity.,0
5.0,Great book,"December 9, 2018",Yes,One of Grisham's most complex novels to date.  Turn back the clock in Ford County to the World War 2 era.,0
5.0,This is Grisham?,"December 9, 2018",Yes,A totally different approach by Griffin. A lawyer's tale with a totally unique spin! I could not stop reading!,0
5.0,Another good Gresham.,"December 9, 2018",Yes,A good surprising ending as usual.,0
5.0,Book,"December 9, 2018",No,Grisham is great!,0
5.0,Vintage Grisham . . . and Better,"December 9, 2018",No,"A treat to experience a singular author writing a longer, slower, more considered novel..As usual the settings came alive, particularly the Bataan section..The relationships on the farm rang true; showing the good side of Southern life if one can actually express that.",0
5.0,The reckoning,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Heart wrenching. Compelling. Sad. Heroic. Proud. Sad. Bonding families as their lives were destroyed. No winners or heroines left in thus story.,0
5.0,Moving Story,"December 9, 2018",No,No one tells a story of the South like John Grisham. The horror of war and race discrimination of the era were well captured.,1
5.0,A page turner.,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"This is Grisham at his best. I learned a lot about the war in the Philippines and the Bataan Death March. Not pleasant, but very informative. The story held my interest from beginning to end.",1
3.0,Historical Plaigerism,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"In the first few chapters we had the ""answer""- so now we needed to discover the ""question""as to why?.Not Grisham's best..The WWII section was boring and predicable. The ""faithful native""killed; the brutality; the heroism and good luck when needed most. The absurd ending..I hope Grisham's is not running out of solid stories. I gave Him 3 stars as I did finish the book on Kindle; glad I did not buy hard copy for wife's Christmas present!",0
5.0,Grisham always good,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Loved this story &amp; surprise ending,0
5.0,Reckoning,"December 9, 2018",Yes,This book had you guessing till the very end...highly recommended read,0
2.0,Ho-Hum,"December 9, 2018",No,"Did not like this book at all.  The bulk of the novel spends time with Pete in the Army in the Philippines.  Although his time in the military defines what the main character is all about but doesn't seem connected with the other parts of the story.  I'm a Grisham fan, but Reckoning was a let down for me.",0
3.0,Boring,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Sort of lo g drawn out and boring finished reading it though not his best,0
5.0,Too good really,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Exceptional book. There in nothing to complain about. Great book to read.,0
2.0,Not Faulkner,"December 9, 2018",Yes,A disappointing novel in many ways. The narrative wandered in too many directions before it got to a mildly surprising conclusion. The long description of the Bataan March and its afterwards really added little to the story. Almost no character development for Lisa or and minimal narrative of what was going on in Clanton  during Pete’s absence. Pete’s motive: he was a cuckhold and couldn’t get over it? Please.,0
3.0,Why did he do it?,"December 9, 2018",No,"On an October morning in 1946, Pete Banning – World War II hero and prominent cotton farmer – walks into the Clanton, Mississippi, office of Methodist pastor Dexter Bell and whips out a pistol...“If it’s about Liza, I can explain.  No, Pete!” Dexter pleads.  Pete fires two bullets into Dexter’s heart and one into his skull just above the nose...Pete has only one statement for the sheriff, family members, his lawyer and the judge: “I have nothing to say.”  Why did Pete do it?  That’s the theme of “The Reckoning” by John Grisham, the master of legal thrillers...In Part One, Pete’s wife Liza is in a state mental institution.  Their children Joel and Stella are in college.  His sister Florry lives in a nearby cottage.  Servants Nineva and Amos, descended from slaves, feel they are well treated by Pete in a state where Jim Crow is alive and well.  Their strapping teenage grandson Jupe does chores...Pete is tried for murder.  Even though he faces the electric chair, he refuses to help his lawyer mount a defense...Part Two is devoted to Pete’s earlier life.  He marries Liza from Memphis.  As an Army officer in the Philippines, he is captured by the Japanese.  He escapes and joins a guerrilla force.  Back home he is considered dead.  Liza is distressed and in need of male attention...In Part Three, Dexter Bell’s widow Jackie and a new man in her life file a wrongful death suit to seize the Banning spread, farmed by the family for generations...Near the end, Florry tells Pete’s children why Pete killed Dexter and also Liza’s secret.  We are given few clues in advance...On balance, I enjoyed “The Reckoning.”  But I wish Part Two was shorter and the resolution more dramatic.  The author should have had Florry reveal what she knew about the reckoning in a prolonged cross-examination.",0
1.0,I can't rate it if audible wont allow me to hear it.,"December 9, 2018",No,I cant use it.,0
5.0,Great  awesome excellent,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Great would have expected another ending but this was fine should not have to write this much for a review,0
5.0,??,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Good read,0
2.0,"Predictable, boring and just overall a depressing story","December 9, 2018",No,"As a longtime fan of Grisham I was disappointed that the story was predictable from the first 30 pages.  Overall other than the history lesson about the WWII pacific conflict, the book was tedious to read. It is just a miserable depressing story for everyone involved.  Six hours wasted.",0
5.0,Very powerful book,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Well done.  Vivid description of the horror of the WW-2 Bataan death march,0
1.0,One of his worst,"December 9, 2018",No,Can't believe I managed to finish it. Went on and on about the secret Frank had.  Dreary and sad. Especially the part about WWII.  Abrupt ending. Skip it.,0
2.0,"A large portion of this book is about the war, not to my taste of reading material","December 9, 2018",No,"This book was harder to read, for me, than other books by John Grisham.  The parts about the main character, Pete, in the war went on for a large portion of the book and I lost interest part way through and had to put it down for a while.  I finally picked it back up and finished it so that I could see how it ended.  The book was OK, but other books that I have read by John Grisham were more to my taste.",1
1.0,Waste of time,"December 9, 2018",Yes,I have read all of Grisham’s books and enjoyed them all until The Reckoning....I struggled to finish this one ....,0
1.0,the wrecking,"December 9, 2018",Yes,Boring unless you study WW11 history and I am a history fan. I am also a GRISHAM fan but not this book. Good mystery and story in the beginning then the bottom drops out when our man is captured by the Japanese. It is as if Grisham has runn out of things and just needs to fill in pages to make the book thick enough to sell. A GREAT disappointment.,0
2.0,"Tedious, redundant, not up to par for a Grisham novel","December 9, 2018",No,"I am typically a huge fan of Grisham novels and was looking forward to the latest release, but was sorely disappointed by The Reckoning. The first 40% of the book was tedious and redundant, spent establishing (over and over) that the main character had committed cold blooded murder, had no defense and refused to explain his motive. There was no further development of the plot or characters, just the same facts repeated over and over. The next section of the book was more interesting, covering the main characters time as a POW and guerilla during WWII. The issue is there was  no connection made to the plot whatsoever, other than to establish the character as a war hero with PTSD. Additionally, readers of Unbroken will find this section VERY familiar to the plight of Louis Zampareni and it felt like a cheap copy cat. The final section of the book provided a very tedious review of the legal appeal process, with no addition information on the crime or plot development. Finally in the last 3 pages Grisham reveals the motive, which was an unsatisfying ending to say the least. This novel seemed a little lazy by Grisham, disappointed and will be hesitant to invest in  another of his novels in the future.",1
2.0,My least favorite John Grisham book,"December 9, 2018",No,"John Grisham has always been one of my favorite writers, I have read almost all of his books. I really struggled to finish this book. It just seems to drag on and on. The parts of the book about WWII in the Philippines were the only part of the story I enjoyed. This is the first John Grisham book I've read that I can't recommend.",0
1.0,Only Grisham book I’ve ever disliked,"December 9, 2018",No,"I have read and enjoyed every previous Grisham book.  This one, however, is not good.  Not coherent, not interesting, not exciting, and overall, not even readable.  It is so tedious at points that I skipped over sections.  It is also weirdly disjointed - you learn what happens before knowing why.  I rarely write reviews, but was compelled to write this one due to my profound disappointment with this book.",0
5.0,Couldn’t put this book down!,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"The best book I’ve read in a long while. You think you know ‘whodunnit’! Great job Mr Grisham, great job!",0
5.0,A Must Read,"December 9, 2018",No,"I couldn’t put this book down. In most of his books, you alway learn something, i.e., the Bataan death march.",0
5.0,One of his best!!!!!,"December 9, 2018",Yes,"Loved this book. It was gritty, and surprising. Definitely one of his best. Hooray for bringing a dark moment in our history to the forefront. Parts were tough to read, but that’s what made it so good.  It was definitely a page turner. Thank you, Mr. Grisham for something new and refreshing.",0
4.0,Great read,"December 9, 2018",Yes,I think it is one of his best books.  I really enjoyed reading it.,0
4.0,Very interesting,"December 9, 2018",No,I found this book to be very interesting.  The intertwining of multiple stories made it hard to put the book down.,0
5.0,Another John Grisham classic!,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"Couldn't put the book down. Riveting, entertaining, heart wrenching and intense. If you're a John Grisham fan you will not be disappointed. If you've never read one of his books before, you'll want to read his others when you're done with ""The Reckoning.""",0
2.0,John Grisham is a terrific writer and,"December 8, 2018",Yes,For a while I stuck with him.  But it was just too slow and painful. I wanted it to be a better story but It wasn’t. A war hero killed a minister.  His wife is committed. Two kids struggle to figure it out losing their home in the process  Painful.,0
5.0,Interesting read,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Book takes us back to Ford County. We have trials and plot twists. But also we have a war story. It’s a good book. I recommend it?,0
5.0,Great story,"December 8, 2018",Yes,I couldn't but the book down until I finished. The ending wasn't as good  or as well rapped-up as he usually does.,0
3.0,When Grisham tries to do an Archer,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"I was estatic when all 3 of my favorite authors made their new releases. I started with Grisham looking for some serious court room drama but was met with a long lesson on WW2. Very Archer like, slow pace and detailed, great for history buffs but not what I would expect from Grisham.",0
5.0,Another great read!!,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"Another great read by John Grisham, with a twist I did NOT see coming. You will get to a certain part and won’t want to put it down until you’re done!",0
1.0,Do not bother,"December 8, 2018",No,The Reckoning was thoroughly un-enjoyable from start to finish.  There isn't a single character that you like.  The story has absolutely no twists or turns.  I feel like I just wasted a lot of time where I could have been reading something else.  Do not waste your time with this book!,0
2.0,Sometimes authors begin to parody themselves.,"December 8, 2018",No,"This book was full of trademark Grisham description and character, but the plot didn't support the 417 pages.  Not at all.  Like another reviewer, I skipped the middle third which took place in WW II Phillipines, and didn't lose anything.  After almost no crucial events one expected the denouement to be electric.  It was incredibly predictable.  I hope he gets back to his old self with the next book.",0
3.0,Not one of his best,"December 8, 2018",Yes,I was looking forward to read this. I am disappointed!.Looking forward to this next book. Hopefully it will be better,0
5.0,Enjoyable Read But A Little Different From Most Grisham Books,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Not as much courtroom/legal drama and more about the history and story of a family.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!,0
5.0,The Best of Grisham,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"I’ve never been disappointed in a Grisham  book and this is  possibly the best of all. Very believable. I thought I knew the ending through most of the book, until I got to it and was stunned. The description of the Bataan death march was especially vivid and realistic. Great book, I give it a 10 out of 10.",0
5.0,Never Saw it Coming!,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"The whole thing is beautifully told.  I'm from the South and loved the stories of the cotton fields, crop failures, etc.  And the history of the Bataan Death March was gruesome and faithful to the truth.  The ending was certainly a shocker and totally unexpected.",0
1.0,Oops!  What Happened?,"December 8, 2018",No,"I'm a huge Grisham fan since his first novel and have always look forward to the next one.  I'm not sure what happened but it's hard to believe that The Reckoning was written by the same author.  It was disjointed, redundant,  and not quite believable.  It lacked the usual suspense and had a disappointing ending.  Not worth the read.  Sorry!",0
1.0,Depressing,"December 8, 2018",No,Depressive from beginning to end!,0
4.0,Great Author &amp; Great reading material.,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Great Book.,0
3.0,Lack of communication,"December 8, 2018",Yes,I was disappointed in this book.  I felt that it jumped back and forth and never really finished the story.  I felt sorry for the children trying to understand why their father shot the minister.  The father's actions created a lot of unnecessary sorrow and confusion for his family.  I guess the one good outcome was understanding how the lack of communication and lying can create terrible circumstances,0
4.0,One of his better stories,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Certain sections drag but altos good read.,0
5.0,A heartbreaking story of deception and error,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"One of John Gresham's finest books, especially among his latest publications.  Features a highly engaging and poignantly appealing, though flawed, leading character who carries out what he believes to be an honorable action, betrayed by the deadly, selfish weakness of one he trusts the most.",0
1.0,My last Gresham book,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"Whatever happened to book editors or publishers?  This is an example of a promising idea, terribly executed.  It cheats long time readers with the promise of a past good author, then totally fails to deliver.  Poor continuity, poor story telling.  Act 1 has nothing to do with Act 2 and just fills pages.  Is this what novels have come to?  The Author and Publisher should be ashamed.  They took the money and ran.",0
2.0,Very frustrating book!,"December 8, 2018",Yes,This book just frustrated me.  What a waste of time and money!  Grisham is phoning it in. I guess his name sells the books and he doesn’t have to impress.,0
5.0,Quite a twist from Grisham,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Wow lll. You gotta read this one. So much of this storyline I did not see coming. Well written as usual. Parts of this book enraged me. Other parts made me feel I was there witnessing stuff I would never want to see. Tremendous book.,0
3.0,"NO central theme in this book,","December 8, 2018",Yes,"If Grisham wants to publish the complete history of the bataan death march do so rather than using it as ""filler"" for this book!!",0
5.0,John Grisham never disappoints!!,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Interesting plot and interconnected stories. Lots of well researched history of the Philippines in WWII. Leaves you speculating until the very end. Wonderful!!,0
5.0,Grisham's At His Best,"December 8, 2018",No,"When I finally read the final sentence I immediately wanted to turn to the first page and begin again. I have read all of Grisham's books. Enjoyed some more than others, but have never felt so invested in the characters as I did with those in The Reckoning. I have started many a book only to abandon it because I couldn't develop any feeling for the characters. Not so this time. I felt for these characters. Every single one of them.",0
5.0,So Post War South,"December 8, 2018",Yes,I love John Grisham. This book was almost a masterpiece.  Sounds just like Mississippi in the 50s. His style in this one was more mystery writer and less courtroom intrigue. But he certainly had me fooled!,0
3.0,Not a legal thriller,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"Grisham can certainly tell a story very well..The problem with this book is mainly the middle section describing the appaling conditions of prisoners of war under Japanese control.  This subject has been over-hashed and Grisham does not add much..Otherwise, the book is readable and is enjoyable to some degree..I expected more from Grisham and was rather disappointed.",0
4.0,Grisham doesn't disappoint,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Not his best but a great read none the less.  I look forward to the next one.,0
3.0,Ending was disappointing,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Liked the first two sections of this novel but the last section was disappointing.,0
4.0,Great story,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Fantastic story and an ending that I will never forget!,0
4.0,Good but Sad,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"Another fine book by Grisham.  Kind of gory in places and a sad story, but historically accurate I would think about the Bataan Death March.",0
2.0,Grisham falls short,"December 8, 2018",No,"I'm one of those readers who reads a new John Grisham book as soon as I can grab it.  That said, as much as I was looking forward to The Reckoning, and as much as I enjoyed reading it, I was ultimately very disappointed...The Reckoning opens with Pete Banning, pillar of the community, war hero, faithful church member, walking into his pastor's office and shooting him, killing him in cold blood.  He doesn't try to hide it, doesn't contest his conviction, and is executed without a word in his defense.  His motives go to the grave with him...At one point in his trial, the defense lawyer offers a lengthy description and testimony about his service in World War 2.  He was a POW in the Philippines, suffered in the Bataan Death March, escaped, and fought heroically as a guerrilla for several years, until the end of the war.  The prosecution stepped in at some point and argued that as heroic as Pete was, it has nothing to do with the pastor's murder or the trial...After the execution, Grisham jumps back in time to Pete's military service.  He includes a lengthy, detailed description of a part of WW2 history about which I knew little.  Assuming it's at least loosely based on historical facts, and that Pete's exploits are based on the experiences of real soldiers, Grisham shines in his dramatizing this historical moment.  I'm grateful to have this perspective, and inspired to read more about the Pacific theater.  However, I have to agree with the lawyer: this had very little to do with the story at hand...Then back to the present, in which Pete's sister, widow, and children are dealing with the aftermath, and facing a legal challenge from the pastor's widow, who is seeking damages.  So what's the big secret? Why did Pete murder his pastor?  You think you sort of know as you read.  When the answer is finally revealed in the final few pages of the book, it's sort of what you think but not quite.  Ultimately, I thought, ""This is what Grisham was driving at the whole time?  Yawn.""..Yes, Grisham tells some great WW2 stories.  Yes, he writes in a way that compels me to keep reading.  Yes, it's nice to return to this post-WW2 era in the south, where Grisham's talent shines.  Yes, there is some legal and courtroom drama that we expect from Grisham.  Despite all that, the whole thing doesn't work together very well.  The Reckoning will make Grisham's readers long for some of his stronger legal fiction",0
5.0,Good read,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"Kept my attention, kept me guessing, and I never expected what was at the end of the story. Puzzle complete",0
1.0,One star is right,"December 8, 2018",Yes,All the one star reviews are correct.,0
1.0,Hmmm...what happened John?  I’d be interested in knowing why you thought this was going to be okay.,"December 8, 2018",Yes,"You’re shaking my confidence as an author! I loved the reverse story line, (the what happened, then the rest of the story of getting to know the characters) BUT after the perfectly ridiculous, anti climatic, nonsensical ending I realized I was savoring the story in anticipation of a great ending (twists, turns, surprises to unfold, Almost stayed home from work to finish it.) Instead we are handed a silly conclusion that had me going back to the index in kindle to see if I had missed something. In fact, the ending was so shallow and unimportant  it negated the rest of what I thought was a good read.",0
2.0,Depressing,"December 8, 2018",No,"Well written, as usual from Grisham. That said, it's the most depressing novel I've read in a long time. No good comes to anyone in this story. It's the story of one family whose lives are filled with pain, sorrow, death, torture, murder and sadness. Have fun.",0
5.0,Classic Grisham,"December 8, 2018",Yes,Another read it all at one timer,0
4.0,A Heavy Dose of Dickensian Misery,"December 7, 2018",No,"John Grisham is, without doubt, a master storyteller. However, I can't remember any of his novels being so thoroughly unrelenting in its misery. Even Dickens had time for some tenderness and cheer, even mystery and suspense. I devoured the book, as I have with all his others, but I found the final revelation underwhelming and I was relieved to finish it.",0
4.0,My thoughts,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"It's hard to imagine that a woman of her pedigree would jeopardize her life, her children by fooling around with the helps son. And then lie about it!",0
2.0,Disappointed,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"Have always enjoyed books by this author however was disappointed in this one.  Characters never fully developed, settings in the Philippines too detailed and long winded, read too much like a war novel with a predictable ending... just could not get into this one",0
1.0,The book is boring and irrelevant.,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"Without a doubt, Grisham’s worst novel EVER. Struggled thru the parts about Bataan. Already hated the Japanese since I remember WWII and didn’t need to be reminded about their atrocities. As a southerner I found the denouement literally unbelievable and the book a total waste of my time. I’m trashing my complete Grisham personal library.",0
2.0,Two thirds of this book is good...,"December 7, 2018",No,Grisham was the first fictional author whose writings I enjoyed. I loved his earlier novels. But for the last few novels I've sworn I was done reading his work. This book was a partial redemption but the entire second section was a waste of time. I've read many books on WWII and the pacific theater. I don't need a fictionalized history lesson engulfing and entire third or more of a fictional novel. Sections 1 &amp; 3 were classic Grisham writings with a good ending. The second section was mostly a waste of time in a psudo history lesson of made up characters and facts.,0
3.0,Bad Grisham Novel,"December 7, 2018",Yes,I felt this book by John Grisham was rather dark and I did not enjoy it.  I am having trouble starting a Grisham novel since this left a bad taste in my mouth.,0
1.0,Read the first 50 pages and the last 10,"December 7, 2018",No,This wasn't Grisham's best.  Not even close.  Read the beginning and the end and you'll be fine.  Or skip it altogether.,0
1.0,"A true ""Death March""","December 7, 2018",Yes,"I have been a fan of Grisham for a long time. However this book has made me doubt my loyalty. I don't see the point of the long narrative about the ""Death March"". It was boring to say the least. I wish I could get my money back.",0
4.0,Hard book to review,"December 7, 2018",No,"The Reckoning, for me, is a hard book to review.  The first part is vintage John Grisham, moving plot, snappy dialogue, subtle humor.  The second part is a historical narrative of the main characters time in WWII, including but not limited to time spent as a Japanese POW, and all that entails. The third,  and last part, is more like the first part and does answer the question of why Pete Banning killed the preacher.  For me, I could have done with a bit less of the wartime experiences of Pete Banning.  If that was what I wanted to read I would choose that type of book.  That being said, I found this a hard book to put down and do recommend it.",0
5.0,One of his Best,"December 7, 2018",Yes,Great historical novel!,0
4.0,one of Grisham's best,"December 7, 2018",Yes,How do you explain a review about a book that grabs you&gt;? This was a terrific novel was spell binding and the ending will astonish you--I could not put it down! highly recommend it,0
4.0,Not the usual Grisham novel,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"A sad story with a sad ending. Very well written , good story line. Kept looking for a happy resolution , however the story line just got darker. If you are looking for a light read this is not it",0
1.0,This book is a waste of time,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"This book started out great!  First section was mysterious (why did the main character kill a man for no reason), and it led me to believe it was all going to lead up to a very climatic ending.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  The characters were all boring, soft, and with no personality.  The middle of the book was a huge waste of a lot of pages (maybe it could have been laid out in 2-3 chapters and the reader would have totally understood the hell the main character went through).  And the ending was AWFUL and made me annoyed that I just wasted my time with this book.  Sorry John Grisham, not your best work.  Maybe you have run out of stories and it is time to pack it in and retire.  This was not worth it.",0
4.0,nice mistery book,"December 7, 2018",Yes,expected more from this author,0
5.0,Reckoning,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"Good book!  However, story dragged out to long.",0
1.0,Grisham finally writes a loser,"December 7, 2018",Yes,I have read all of Grisham's books and enjoyed them all until now.  He took 400 pages to tell a story which could easily have been told in 100 pages.  It was almost as if he felt that it was time to publish a book so he groped around for a story.  He took a good chunk to retell the WW II experiences of the protagonist which were of marginal relevance and definitely could have been shortened.,0
1.0,Disappointing!,"December 7, 2018",Yes,Super disappointing book!! Very anti-climactic!,0
5.0,John Grisham does it again,"December 7, 2018",Yes,Another amazing novel full of twists and turns,0
1.0,One of the worst books I've ever read,"December 7, 2018",No,"Part 1 is great Grisham.  The rest of the book is trash.  Part 2 has nothing to do with the plot, and is a fictionalized version of the way the Japanese treated American and Philippine soldiers at Bataan in World War II.  We already had the basics of that in Part 1, so Part 2 shouldn't even have been written.  A big family secret lurks all the way through Parts 1 and 3, and  in the last few pages, the whole truth comes out.  Grisham really had to stretch to come up with such a lousy story.",0
5.0,Excellent Book,"December 7, 2018",Yes,Was an excellent thriller.  Particularly appreciated the description of the horrors of war in the Pacific.,0
4.0,Follow through to the e,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I've read every John Grisham novel and have never been disappointed.  At first I thought this was going to be the exception.  Of course, I was wrong.  I gave it four stars because it did seem a little slow after the first several chapters, but when it picked up, it PICKED up.  As usual the characters are so real and the story line because of the time period in which it took place, believable.  After awhile I couldn't put it down.  The part about Bataan and Douglas MacArthur was mind-blowing.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I'm ready for the next Grisham novel!",0
4.0,A First Class thriller with an unexpected ending (of course).,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"A good read and a page turner. It was exciting because the reader wants to know how it will end, but the ending is a real surprise, Very good, but for me not Grisham's best.",0
5.0,What you would expect from Grisham,"December 7, 2018",Yes,Another novel that I just couldn’t put down.,0
4.0,Good Read Except.........,"December 7, 2018",Yes,Keep my interest throughout the book except for the final chapter.  Wanted more of a closure than what developed.  It seemed a little contrived.,0
5.0,Page turner,"December 7, 2018",Yes,"I had not read a John Grisham  novel since Testament.  I forgot what an excellent story teller he is.  Every character becomes real, history is thoroughly relayed and educational.  The story is excellent. I'm not a writer  so my words are simple, but this is one JG I'm glad not to have passed by.",1
5.0,Wow!! What a book,"December 6, 2018",Yes,Loved the book . A page turner!!,0
5.0,Intriguing,"December 6, 2018",Yes,As always? John Grisham has done it again.  Great book with an ending I did not expect.  I learned about history as he told this story.,0
5.0,quality,"December 4, 2018",Yes,"Book came quickly. new,",0
4.0,An interesting weave of a tale.,"December 3, 2018",Yes,"I hardly know what to write about Grisham's latest, ""The Reckoning."".He's been a favorite author of mine since his very first book, I never let one of his novels go unread..But this one seems to have a different twist or flavor..Certainly the setting of rural Mississippi is very authentic, no doubt..But the story seems to twist and turn often but still spell binding..I felt the history portion about The Bataan March during WW2 was quite authentic, though harsh to read but it was truthfully written..I thought I knew what the final pages would be but was so wrong.  And I guess I thought all would come out well in the end for the children..This wasn't Mr. Grisham's best but still a good novel and I don't regret purchasing it..Read and let us know what you think, too.",0
5.0,Compelling. Classic Ford County crosses the International Date Line.,"December 3, 2018",No,"Definitely one of Grisham's best works...His Ford County fans are whip-sawed from Clanton to the other side of the planet and introduced to the jungles of Bataan and the PTO and then brought back for the usual court rooms, lawyers, and rural county politics....and 1950's justice..Grisham aficionados might encounter a little pre jet-age travel shock from the long trip but the plot twists and characters make for a fairly fast read and it's a fantastic piece of accurate historical fiction..Definitely a boundary stretcher.",0
1.0,Pitiful attempt by Grisham,"December 2, 2018",No,"I don’t think it is possible that this book could be any worse. Character and plot development  were so weak there was little to compel the reader to invest time to determine the outcome. The main character might have been a fine war hero but the author never connected well enough for the reader to give a rat's behind about him or any of the characters. For a New York Tines best selling author, this book is beyond disappointing.",0
4.0,Gripping.,"December 2, 2018",Yes,Lovely read. Keeps the reader spellbound till the very last minute. Grisham does it again. The period drama mixed with the legal twists and turns. Absolutely breathtaking. A definite must read.,0
4.0,Won't review,"December 1, 2018",No,End.R c b F g t F d d c.It it it it it it no no..the only one who can help 3.,0
3.0,Not Up To Snuff,"December 1, 2018",Yes,"Just didn’t do it for me. Too long a wait for too little at the end. And this current penchant for waxing poetic about set &amp; setting seemed, at times contrived.",0
1.0,Very disappointing,"December 1, 2018",No,"I'm a John Grisham fan, but this book was very disappointing.  I don't think he made much of an effort.  The story line is thin and interspersed with war history of the main character, which actually seems like a separate story in order to stretch the book  to 400 pages.  My recommendation is - don't waste your time with this one.",0
1.0,I would not recommend this book,"November 30, 2018",No,This was one of the worst books I've read in a long time . I always love John Grisham's books. But this one fell very far from the tree .,0
5.0,Another great novel by John Grisham.,"November 30, 2018",No,Could not put it down!  Great book!,0
3.0,A Painful Read,"November 12, 2018",Yes,"First, I have been a huge fan of Grisham for many years. This book was tedious and painful to read. The section about the Bataan march was interesting as I did not know the details and every American should know this history. However, how the plot unfolded was long and one knew where it was going but the writing didn't sing like Grisham's usually does.",0
5.0,Wow!,"November 10, 2018",Yes,Amazing story. Very hard to put down. I’m sure things like this happened more than any of us realize. I’d recommend it to anyone that wants a good read.,0
4.0,Gresham back in business...don't pass this one up!,"November 9, 2018",Yes,What a crack in the ceiling! I was floored by his newest novel. This is not your usual Grisham novel. He holds back and leaves you waiting till the last few pages. I was floored after finishing it. Sad but satisfies. Read it.,0
5.0,You feel like you are there.,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Keep you intrigued. Just want to keep reading.,0
5.0,Really enjoyed the book.,"November 8, 2018",Yes,Loved the actual history entwined with the fiction. Great read.  I did feel like the ending was a bit abrupt.,0
4.0,Grisham Fan!,"November 8, 2018",Yes,"Love this writer! Great book, I agree with his wife the battle descriptions were VERY vivid, but I guess it was necessary to truly set the scene.  Enjoyed this book!",0
1.0,SAD BUT TRUE,"November 8, 2018",Yes,I guess Grisham has run out of ideas. I buy all his books because most of them are great. The book was totally boring except for the last pages which had a semi surprising ending. Not worth all the time wasted reading the previous pages.,0
4.0,Needs a better ending,"November 8, 2018",No,"I enjoyed the story, even the WWII section, but was dissatisfied with the ending.  Left too many loose ends.  Would have been happy to read another 20 pages or so if those loose ends were tied up.",0
1.0,At the bottom of Grisham's books,"November 8, 2018",No,Too much digression.  His description of the lead character's time during WWII was  too long. I have read all of Grisham's books and this is at the bottom of the list.  A long way from his earlier novels.  Makes one wonder if he actually did the writing.  The book became a bore to read.,0
2.0,Not one of Grisham’s best.,"November 8, 2018",No,"The Reckoning is not one of Grisham’s best, far from it. While the story and characters are interesting, the writing style is juvenile. Frankly, At times I thought I was back reading “Dick &amp; Jane (and Spot).”",0
5.0,PHENOMENAL  and very interesting from the history that it describes .  The only John Grisham novel to make me cry.,"November 7, 2018",Yes,PHENOMENAL  and very interesting from the history that it describes .  The only John Grisham novel to make me cry.,0
5.0,excellent novel.,"November 7, 2018",Yes,excellent novel.,0
5.0,Great story with lots of history,"November 7, 2018",No,I loved this book. So different from any other book Grisham has written. Anyone can read a mystery but to read a novel of this magnitude and learning at the same time is so refreshing. Good job on this one Mr. Grisham.,0
4.0,Background story is important to whole novel,"November 7, 2018",Yes,This was a page turner and well grounded in historical setting,0
5.0,Gripping,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"Good plot, interesting twist at the end",0
5.0,It is different than any other of his books.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,This may be the best book John has written. Would love to see a movie made of it.,0
5.0,Different then most Grissom books,"November 6, 2018",Yes,Big surprise at the end!,0
5.0,Grisham rocks!,"November 6, 2018",Yes,Best author of legal thrillers!,0
5.0,Review by Roger,"November 6, 2018",Yes,This was one of his best with an unexpected ending.,0
2.0,"Depressing, not Entertaining","November 6, 2018",Yes,"I have read every book Grisham has written.  Half way through this book I started to want to go to the end and read the last chapter.  I should have done that and saved myself a lot of really depressing diatribe.  The WWII part was the most interesting, but I read Grisham for entertainment and plot, not to be depressed by a rushed and unsatisfying ending.  If you loved the past Grisham, save a lot of time and heartburn and don't read this.",0
5.0,Good book,"November 6, 2018",Yes,Excellent story....as usual from John Grisham,0
2.0,Do not waste your time on this book!,"November 6, 2018",Yes,Dislike whole books- big waste of time!,0
5.0,Just a great read.,"November 6, 2018",No,Excellent book.  A great story.,0
5.0,A real page turner,"November 6, 2018",Yes,This was a very good read! Jihn Grisham is at his best writing about rural lawyers and their clients. There is no way the reader will guess the plot or ending. The story was well written with great character deveolopment.,0
2.0,Lot of skipped pages.....a lot.,"November 6, 2018",No,Used to love John's books...not so much anymore.  Dragged on and on and really...I skipped more in this book then I have in any other book for a long time....not very good.,0
5.0,The Reckoning,"November 6, 2018",Yes,Typical Grissom.Lots of twists especially the ending.Excellent as always.,0
5.0,"One of the best, ever!","November 6, 2018",Yes,"The Reckoning is terrific! The 2nd section details our hero's life in Bataan during WWII. Whether or not you are a history buff, you will not be able to put the book down.",0
3.0,A Different Grishem story-line,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"I was disappointed in the plot.  I though there was too much detail in the flashback - it was interesting history, but much went above meaningfulness to the story.  The ending continued my desire for the Grishem-of=Old.",0
1.0,Did John Grisham really write this...,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"I can’t beliveve this book was written by the same man who wrote The Partner, The Firm, A Time to Kill or even Skipping Christmas! This book was horrible! There was so much of the book that really had no point or real effect on the story! I really hate that I spent 16.99 on this book that I literally had to force myself to finish! Don’t waste your money or time! If you are a Grisham fan this book is going to be very disappointing!",0
5.0,Holds attention from first sentence to last.,"November 6, 2018",Yes,I enjoyed this book totally. Can't wait til his nex t one.,0
4.0,Supprise,"November 6, 2018",Yes,"Well written,Great ending.",0
3.0,Surprised and Disappointed,"November 6, 2018",No,"Why this ending, John? The main character seemed so honorable and well-respected. Hated what happened to the rest of the family. Our nation’s wars impacted a lot of families in many different ways. This was just another example of how deep an impact it can be. Keep writing, John. There is another great story with a happy ending somewhere within you.",0
5.0,"I reckon I must recommend ""The Reckoning: A Novel""","November 5, 2018",Yes,This book is classic John Grisham. It is masterfully written and easy to dive into. The plot keeps you guessing until the very last page.,0
5.0,Another good novel by J.Grisham with an awesome conclusion.  Enjoyed the entire book.,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I have read all of J. Grisham’s novels and they are all excellent. This one is no exception. From years of personal experience, this story line is very good and believable.",0
5.0,Forever Reading,"November 5, 2018",Yes,WWnddnt on forever but had a satisfying ending. Grisham can spin a yarn with the best of them! Now on to his next book.,0

1.0,Depressing,"November 5, 2018",Yes,"I did not finish book, was bored, not what I expected.  Wanted more from Grishom, stick to action trial",1
3.0,"Captivating story, very disappointing ending.","November 4, 2018",No,"Huge John Grisham fan, especially his Ford County stories. While the writing was just as captivating and page turning as the rest, I expected more from the ending, especially given themes of heroism and fighting racism in previous books. Felt like this ending was thought of at the last minute. Still paints a great picture, but don’t expect a Sycamore Row type ending.",0
3.0,Too depressing,"November 4, 2018",No,"I was pretty excited when I got hands on to this one - who doesn't like a John Grisham...The start is brilliant - and then it becomes depressing. Not unlike the depression mentioned in the book. You keep reading because you hope that like his other books, things will turn favourable to the Bantings...The timeline is all scattered. The 1st half is chronologically the 2nd part. The ending is depressing, devastating and the last 100 pages just stretch the book for the final negative end...Masterful, but do you want to end up sad, negative? I'd say avoid it - unless you want a sad book to sadden your days.",0
3.0,Starts out well.,"November 4, 2018",Yes,"This book started out great. It was interesting, the characters were clearly defined and the story really drew me in. I gave 3 stars because, though the book expertly strung you along, the ending was so anticlimactic, i thought i had missed something and went back to read parts again. I really expected better.",0
4.0,Another Great Grisham Read,"November 4, 2018",No,"Judging by the other reviews, you will either love or hate this book. I loved this book. The historical section about the Bataan Death March was so well done, and I enjoyed every word of it.  Now I'll have to read a biography of General MacArthur! I think Grisham's pace was good, and I enjoyed his characters.  I was disappointed that he didn't flesh out Aunt Florry more - she was said to be quite quirky and I'd like to know more about why that was said about her. All in all, it was a delightful book.",0
5.0,Great read,"November 4, 2018",Yes,As usual a great book.  I enjoyed the history of wwII in the Philippines. A family tragedy.  Great suspense and characters,0
